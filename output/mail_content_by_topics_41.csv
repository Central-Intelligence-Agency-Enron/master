 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.

I enjoyed our interview today and hope to continue discussions with Enron
about a summer internship.

I couldn't resist sending you this link.  I don't know if you recall, but
during our talk we conducted an exercise attempting to determine new uses
for tissue.  I was surprised to learn that Kimberly-Clark has just announced
a new product.  They actually were holding a analyst conference call this
morning to discuss earnings and their new venture.  Your questions are
certainly very current!  I wish I had been creative enough to think of this
product during our interview.

better idea by April 15 - our timeline for completing our look at a revenue

are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our 
revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.  
Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect 
that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost 
centers.  By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out 
where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as 
revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should 
be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!

said no, and I also said we know more about this company than any other 
exposure we have (which we should).

I also spoke with M. Kopper today and he thinks the proposed deal w/ TXU to 
pay slightly more for a plant with the proviso that we get a cleaner contract 
is a good idea, rather than paying a lot of money to an investment bank. 

Moral of story in my opinion is to try and improve deal structure with TXU 
through the plant purchase or other structured deal. Do no more (large) deals 
with TXU that significantly increase credit exposure ($10mm??) unless we buy 
a derivative that reduces exposure simultaneously. Continue to stay on top of 
TXU with frequent meetings with their management to maintain a close 
relationship with good communication.

71,"I am writing you to inform you of an incident that occurred at the NCL
FRACTIONATOR this week. I would like to go into detail on what occurred to
ensure that everyone has a good understanding of what kind of employee is
involved and the potential for further intentional acts like this from this
disgruntled employee. I would like to have some feedback on this to ensure
that we take the necessary means to ensure that we cover all of the basis.

On Wednesday 1/31/01 we had a PSV go off on one of our process vessels due
to a plant upset. I was notified that the incident was minimal with no
spill or Hydrocarbon release which exceeded the reportable quantity. I
quickly drove to the sight and investigated the incident, I found the
information to be true. There was no detectable hydrocarbon, only a small
amount of rust on the ground which was ejected from the inside of the
emergency stack. I notified the head plant operator & requested an incident
report to be filled out, which he has since delivered to me. I checked the
stack chart and noticed only a small release. At this point I felt that
there was no reason to call in a breakdown to the APCD because we had
neither exceeded the reportable quantity, and the equipment did as it was
designed breaking no rules. I then assigned a clean up crew and an employee
to inspect the PSV's and ensure the proper operation of the equipment
involved. All was cleaned up and the equipment serviced properly, and I am
currently going over the incident report with our safety coordinator.

During the clean up on the day of the incident I was approached by our
Utility Operator Clark Layshot who was on during the incident. Clark was
very upset and was pointing the finger at Mark Stringer who was the Head
Operator on duty. Clark said that the PSV had gone off for an hour and had
released over 5000 gallons of NGL. I new this to be untrue for many
reasons, for one I responded quickly enough that the liquid would still
have been there on the ground, the chart showed exactly the time of
starting and stopping of the release which was just a matter of minutes, I
also new because I was on the phone with the others involved on my drive
out to the plant. I listened to Clarks remarks and let him know that I was
investigating the incident and the discussion was ended.

The following day while I was giving a operational tour to Eugene Ogorman,
I was confronted once more by Clark who said he needed to speak to me
immediately, so I excused myself and met with Clark. Clark said that I
could either have 5 hours or 2 weeks, I asked Clark what he meant and he
said that he was giving his notice. I then asked him why when he became
extremely hostile and said in many words that he was very unhappy! He told
me that everyone was liars, that ENRON was a horrible company, that the
facility was going to blow up and how he was going to kick some of the
employees asses. This went on for a while with numerous other extremely
intense encounters. I then notified my boss, Rick Suderman who in turn made
the appropriate calls.

Today we were the recipients of an incident investigation performed by the
SJVU APCD. We were met by Mike Oldershaw of the APCD who typically does our
compliance testing. Mike informed us that his office was notified of an
incident which released for 48 hours NGL through our west emergency stack.
They were also told that the ground was saturated with hydrocarbon and
insinuated that EOTT/ETS operations was trying to hide this.

Myself and Rick Suderman accompanied Mike through the complete
investigation which included inspection of the release sight, inspection of
the operator logs, inspection of the stack flow charts, and an emission
inspection of the components involved. Mike expressed to us that who ever
called in was disgruntled and obviously fabricated a story to try and
create problems for the company. We went over the permit for the usage of
the emergency stack and all agreed that we were not in violation. Mike was
not sure if a breakdown needed to be reported, so he agreed to call us with
the final outcome of this investigation once he discussed it with his boss.

I am happy to say that after all of this Mike Oldershaw called me back and
said that he had talked to his boss and they both agree that we followed
the rules and none were broken. Mike said that we were in compliance and
there would be no NOTICE OF VIOLATION, the equipment did as it was designed
and the operations group worked well in controlling and isolating the
situation. Mike said that he feels very good about what EOTT and ETS is
doing and the approach that we are taking to ensure compliance. I have
since notified Larry Campbell who informed me to call John steenberg and to
send an email to all of you.

If there are any questions please contact me, thanks for all of your help,

72,"Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 
and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status 
of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.",,,EPA Redrock

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.",Dynegy,,Enron NYSE

Stack Manager Changes

Fill Order Enhancements - (Effective Tuesday September 25)
?	To fill a Top of Stack order in Stack Manager, Right click on the pink shaded order in the depth window of Stack Manager and select fill.
?	The trader now has the ability to fill limit orders that appear at the top of the trader's stack on both sides. 
?	The order will now be filled at the full order volume regardless of the trader's stack volume.
?	Filling an order will not move the trader's price or cause a hedge to occur.

Resize floated stack windows- (Effective Tuesday September 25)

You will now have the ability to resize the stack window to the desired extent.

Website Changes ( Effective Monday September 24)

Limit Order Restrictions on Physical Transactions -
?	Customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions. If a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it.
?	If a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price, both orders will be cancelled. The customer would have effectively transacted with himself.

Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks.

HEADLINE: Testimony Indicates California Electricity Market Was Troubled in 
1998

BYLINE: By Brandon Bailey

BODY:


??SACRAMENTO, Calif.--California's electricity market was showing signs of
trouble as far back as 1998, the year that it was officially opened to
competition, members of a special legislative investigating committee were 
told
Wednesday.

??Abnormal price spikes -- far higher than what should have occurred in a
competitive market -- were showing up in August 1998, the committee was told 
by
Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist and top advisor to the California 
Independent
System Operator, which runs the state's transmission grid.

??Appearing on the first day of hearings called by a state Senate select
committee to investigate alleged wholesale energy price manipulation, Wolak
testified that the ISO's economic advisors repeatedly found signs that power
suppliers were able to influence prices over the last three years -- even 
before
wholesale prices soared skyhigh last summer.

??By controlling even a relatively small portion of power supply, just enough
to make a difference in whether the state could meet consumers' needs, Wolak
said, generators have been able to charge prices far higher than their costs.

??All told, the ISO has estimated, power suppliers collected more than $ 6
billion in unjustified profits last year.

??In his opinion, Wolak added, that violates the terms by which federal
regulators allowed the suppliers to enter the state's newly deregulated market
when it opened in 1998.

??The ISO is now filing petitions with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, asking that agency to revoke the generators' right to charge
unregulated prices.

??But Wolak repeatedly told the committee that he had no evidence that the
suppliers acted in collusion or that they had violated any federal anti-trust
laws.

??When state Senator Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, pressed him on the point, Wolak
insisted, ""I can't say yes, I can't say no. There's a lot of things that
certainly look puzzling. It's hard without further information and analysis to
say definitively, but there's lots of things to seem to be worth looking 
into.""

??Dunn, a former consumer attorney, is leading the Legislature's efforts to
answer a question that a host of other state and federal officials have also
posed: have California's electricity prices been the result of any illegal or
unethical acts?

??Power suppliers and their representatives have repeatedly said the answer is
no. They say their prices are the result of short supplies and natural market
swings.

??""Eleven investigations into California's electricity market have been
conducted or are currently under way,"" said a statement issued Wednesday by 
Jan
Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers
Association. ""Not one has found or proven any wrongdoing by generators.""

??Dunn, however, said Wednesday's testimony was only the start of what he
promised would be a vigorous investigation. He said the committee has already
asked several power companies for records and other information and he hinted
that subpoenas may be issued in the coming weeks.

??""We will try to figure out how to stop these high prices if they are
unjustified,"" Dunn said at the beginning of the hearing.

??""We're not going to be looking for ways to finance these payments,"" he 
added.
The state is now paying $ 70 million a day to buy power for California
consumers, after major utilities wracked up billions in debts while buying 
power
on the open market in recent months.

The State Governor Asks Generators to Take Less Than They're Owed Power: 
Meeting with firms, Davis says that settling for 70% of debt would help

SACRAMENTO -- After spending months bashing independent power generators, 
Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday called on them to take 30% less than the $1.2 
billion they are owed by Southern California Edison. 
""The Legislature [is] going to insist on a reduction,"" Davis said after a 
meeting in his office with representatives of a dozen power generating 
companies. Davis said he told them that ""70% this year was more valuable to 
them than whatever they get two or three years down the line"" if Edison is 
forced into bankruptcy.
Davis urged generators to help California extricate itself from a summer of 
rolling blackouts by selling every available electron to the state. 
He held out the possibility that he might sign legislation imposing a 
windfall profits tax on generators if they fail to help out this summer. 
""My attitude on that would depend a lot on whether they showed good faith and 
cooperated throughout this process,"" Davis said, emerging after a four-hour, 
closed-door meeting with the generators. 
The Democratic governor issued an invitation last week to the chief executive 
officers of power generating and marketing companies including Enron, 
Reliant, Duke Energy and others to meet with him in Sacramento. But most of 
the executives who attended were a few pay grades below CEO. 
Davis said he urged that the executives press lawmakers to approve the deal 
he struck with Edison in which the state would give the ailing utility an 
infusion of cash by buying its transmission system for $2.76 billion. Edison 
would use the money to restructure its debt and pay its creditors. 
Davis said lawmakers will not approve the deal unless the independent power 
generators take less than they are owed. 
He noted that the state and the power generators have ""a collective interest 
in seeing that this summer has as few disruptions as possible."" If California 
is hit with repeated blackouts, Davis has said, other states will delay or 
end efforts to deregulate their electricity markets. 
Executives, who braved taunts from a few protesters wearing pig masks and 
carrying a small but loudly squealing pig, characterized the meeting as 
businesslike. But at least some generators are less than enthusiastic about 
taking less than they are owed. 
""I have a real concern about the notion that we should give back some of the 
money we made,"" said John Stout, a senior vice president of the Houston-based 
Reliant Energy, which says it is owed $300 million by Southern California 
Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. 
Stout said that much of the money Reliant made in California is being 
reinvested in power plant construction--although he added that the company 
has no generators under construction in California. 
""Political uncertainty has put a huge risk factor on investment in 
California,"" Stout said. 
Randy Harrison, an executive with Mirant, based in Atlanta, said the issue of 
a so-called ""haircut"" was discussed, though not in detail. Harrison said it 
is ""not completely off the table."" But he added that his company is not 
profiteering. Nor has it withheld electricity in any attempt to manipulate 
wholesale energy prices. 
""Our people are working 24 hours a day and we are spending millions of 
dollars to try and keep our power plants up and running,"" Harrison said. 
The meeting was aimed at opening communication with the generators. But Davis 
aides said the governor also wanted to bring attention to companies that he 
believes are at least partly responsible for California's energy crisis. 
The meeting occurred as polls show that voters are increasingly angry about 
the energy crisis and as lawmakers, fearful that the energy crisis will wreck 
California's economy, sharpen their attacks on power generators. 
Legislators have introduced bills to impose a windfall profits tax on 
generators and make it a felony to manipulate electricity markets. Lt. Gov. 
Cruz Bustamante and Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews (D-Tracy) sued several 
generators last week. Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer is investigating whether 
generators violated antitrust and other laws as wholesale prices soared to 
record heights, hobbling Edison and helping push PG&E into bankruptcy. 
Voters are not sure who is to blame, but they are convinced that ""whoever is 
taking our money is taking way too much,"" said Democratic political 
consultant Richie Ross. 
""They want to find this deregulation's Charles Keating,"" Ross said, referring 
to a central figure in the 1980s savings and loan debacle. 
Still, as much as Davis and others demonize generators, the state needs them, 
some officials say. 
""We don't have enough power without them,"" said Assembly Energy Committee 
Chairman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles). ""There needs to be an adult 
discussion to see what can be worked out.""

		US AND CANADA: Few US business chiefs see recession ahead White Sulphur 
Springs Financial Times; May 10, 2001
By PERONET DESPEIGNES and ANDREW HILL

		Only 11 per cent of chief executives at the largest US companies believe the 
country is heading for a recession this year, according to a survey released 
yesterday, but most agree 2001 will be at best a year of sluggish growth. 
		The survey was published to coincide with the spring meeting of the Business 
Council, an association of chief executives from many of the largest US 
companies. 
		Bill Harrison, president and chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, the banking 
group, said the survey reflected ""substantial uncertainty and difference of 
opinion"" about the potential length and depth of the slowdown. 
		Business leaders also appeared divided about the role of the Federal Reserve. 
The chief executives listed the Fed's interest rate increases as the most 
important cause of the US economic slowdown, but they also gave credit to the 
central bank for staving off recession by easing monetary policy this year. 
		The Business Council survey released at last October's meeting was an early 
indicator of corporate America's growing concern about the US economic 
outlook. 
		Yesterday's report indicated nearly three quarters of US business leaders 
expected growth to improve in 2002, but of those who responded, 70 per cent 
expected growth in output this year of between 0 and 1.5 per cent. Some 19 
per cent predicted economic growth of 1.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, and only 
11 per cent predicted a US recession. 
		The business leaders also remained pessimistic about growth outside the US. 
The survey found they expected 1-2.5 per cent growth in the euro-zone this 
year, down from 3.4 per cent in 2000, and growth of 0 to 1 per cent in Japan, 
compared with 1.7 per cent last year. 
		There was, however, optimism about the potential for continued productivity 
improvements. ""The wide majority of respondents expect that the current pace 
of productivity growth can and will be maintained,"" said Mr Harrison, 
vice-chairman of the council. 
		Economic data released on Monday showed US workers' productivity slipped in 
the first three months of this year, but Mr Harrison said it would be wrong 
to overreact to data from one quarter. 
		More than 80 current and former chairmen and chief executives are expected to 
attend the Business Council sessions today and tomorrow at the Greenbrier 
resort hotel in West Virginia. 
		One of the hottest topics will be the US energy crisis. Scott McNealy of Sun 
Microsystems, the computer group, and Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, the energy 
group, criticised the sluggishness with which California had reacted to the 
problems. 
		Mr McNealy said it was time to make ""trade-offs on the environmental front"", 
including reconsidering the use of nuclear power. 
		* One of the most prominent groups of US economists remains ""steadfast"" in 
its belief that a US recession is unlikely, Peronet Despeignes writes in 
Washington. The National Association of Business Economics said in its latest 
quarterly economic outlook, based on a survey of 27 members, that interest 
rate cuts by the Fed would sustain economic growth. The chance of a recession 
was put at 35 per cent, and most panellists agreed any recession would likely 
be ""milder than the usual post-World War II recession"". 
		The group maintained its forecast for economic growth of 2 per cent in 2001, 
but lowered its forecast for 2002 to 3.1 per cent from 3.5 per cent. The 
panel also expected inflation of 3 per cent in 2001 and 2.5 per cent in 2002. 
		The group reversed its previous criticism of monetary policy as ""too tight"", 
deeming the Fed's current conduct ""just right"". 
		Most panellists attributed the slowdown to a ""classic inventory correction"", 
the Fed's monetary tightening, which ended a year ago, and the drop in stock 
prices since March of last year.

Abreast of the Market
Dow Industrials, Nasdaq Decline; Cisco Helps Weaken Tech Issues
By Robert O'Brien
Dow Jones Newswires

05/10/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Disappointment with Cisco Systems' earnings statement weakened 
technology issues exposed to the telecommunications-gear business, but 
without causing any fallout in the rest of the market. 
Cisco itself declined $1.25, a loss of 6%, to $19.09 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq 
Stock Market trading, after the company, the leading maker of 
Internet-switching equipment, came through late Tuesday with fiscal 
third-quarter results that closely tracked the forecast the company offered 
last month. Meanwhile, the commentary accompanying the profit statement 
didn't do anything to stimulate hope for a pickup in the moribund 
telecom-equipment market.
Shares in makers of the communications chips used in Cisco's networking 
products declined sharply, with PMC-Sierra falling 3.99 to 40.11, while 
Conexant Systems declined 1.33 to 9.87, and Broadcom dropped 4.29 to 40.24, 
all on Nasdaq. 
Some of the enterprise networking products also came undone, with Extreme 
Networks falling 2.16 to 32.49 on Nasdaq. Makers of rival communications 
technologies also took a spill. Juniper Networks declined 1.53 to 57.37, 
while Ciena dropped 1.06 to 60.54, both on Nasdaq. 
""Cisco's results put further scrutiny on the earnings and revenue projections 
of related companies as we look ahead to second-quarter results,"" said Brian 
Belski, fundamental market strategist at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ""But on 
a relative basis, the market held in there."" 
The Nasdaq Composite Index, suffering from the Cisco fallout, declined 42.14, 
or 1.9%, to end at 2156.63. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average acquitted 
itself nicely, keeping its loss to 16.53, or 0.15%, to finish at 10866.98. 
Investors adopted a somewhat defensive posture in the face of the weakness in 
technology, gravitating toward areas that aren't especially sensitive to 
economic trends, or toward sectors where profit growth looks dependable. 
Shares of Procter & Gamble, for example, moved up 1.69 to 66.19, one of the 
better moves by consumer-product stocks, which generally aren't sensitive to 
economic weakness. 
Utilities also proved popular. Duke Energy gained 1.87 to 45.84, Public 
Service Enterprise Group advanced 1.08 to 46.20, and Enron climbed 3.09 to 
59.20. The Dow Jones Utility Average increased 5, or 1.3%, to 383.74. 
Energy stocks rose briskly, after weekly inventory data released late Tuesday 
tamped down some of the concerns about increasing reserves stoked by reports 
last week. Chevron gained 1.63 to 95.43, Texaco added 1.28 to 71.10, and 
Exxon Mobil moved ahead 98 cents to 89.72. Oil-services and equipment 
providers, which have been in a funk, recovered nicely, with Schlumberger 
gaining 1.14 to 62.95, Halliburton advancing 1.28 to 42.51, and B.J. Services 
improving 1.39 to 75.90. 
Maxim Integrated Products (Nasdaq) fell 2.51 to 49.49. The Sunnyvale, Calif., 
maker of analog circuits posted fiscal third-quarter results late Tuesday 
that matched Wall Street's projections, but also gave details about the 
expected decline in its revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter. Lehman 
Brothers, which had forecast weak guidance, said in a research note that it 
remains cautious about the company's outlook. 
Other integrated circuit makers also declined in the session, with Linear 
Technology falling 2.38 to 48.04, while Analog Devices fell 1.61 to 46.35. 
Chip maker National Semiconductor lowered its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings 
forecasts, and announced plans to cut 10% of its work force, but the stock 
made up intraday weakness, finishing unchanged at $25. 
Exodus Communications (Nasdaq) fell 69 cents to 9.43. The Santa Clara, 
Calif., provider of Internet hosting services said it planned to cut 15% of 
its work force as part of an effort to cut costs. 
WorldCom (Nasdaq) inched up 31 cents to 18.29. UBS Warburg reiterated its 
strong buy rating on the Clinton, Miss., telecommunications service provider, 
saying that the company's recent bond offering, which has been a drag on its 
share price, won't have much, if any, impact on its ability to live up to 
earnings forecasts. 
Verizon Communications sagged 1.78 to 53.82. The telecommunications service 
concern unveiled one of the largest convertible debt issues ever, a $3 
billion offering of zero-coupon notes. 
Johnson & Johnson gained 30 cents to 98.25. The New Brunswick, N.J., 
medical-products concern said it is in discussions about acquiring Inverness 
Medical Technology's diabetes-care product operations for about $1.3 billion 
in stock. 
Sepracor (Nasdaq) gained 3.49 to 30.49. The Marlborough, Mass., specialty 
drug maker said the Food and Drug Administration accepted for review its 
capsule-form version of Soltara, an allergy-relief treatment. 
Willamette Industries moved up 19 cents to 48.75. The Portland, Ore., lumber 
and paper-products concern rejected Weyerhaeuser's sweetened takeover bid of 
$50 a share, calling the offer inadequate. Weyerhaeuser, Federal Way, Wash., 
eased 15 cents to 56.22. 
Northrop Grumman fell 3.50 to 88. The Los Angeles defense contractor made an 
unsolicited bid to buy rival Newport News Shipbuilding for $67.50 a share, or 
$2.1 billion, in cash and stock. Newport News added four cents to 65.04. 
General Dynamics, which had previously agreed to buy Newport News for the 
same price, fell 15 cents to 78.15. 
Shares of several other aerospace and defense contractors moved higher in the 
session, after Credit Suisse First Boston sketched the benefits to the group 
from some of the Bush administration's prospective military-spending 
initiatives. TRW added 2.05 to 40.20, Boeing rose 54 cents to $65, and 
Raytheon advanced 35 cents to 29.46. 
Alliant Techsystems, another name in the group identified by Credit Suisse 
First Boston as benefiting from military spending, fell 2.50 to 95.50, even 
though the Minneapolis aerospace and defense concern's fiscal fourth-quarter 
earnings topped Wall Street's profit forecasts. 
Forest Laboratories moved ahead 2.88 to 62.21 following some upbeat comments 
from Thomas Weisel Partners. 
Triad Hospitals fell 2.45 to 24.70. Lehman Brothers cut its rating on the 
Dallas hospital operator, citing concerns about the recent acquisition of 
Quorum Health Group. 
Circuit City dropped 97 cents to 13.55, after Lehman Brothers in a research 
note offered some cautious comments about the valuation of the Richmond, Va., 
consumer-electronics retailer. 
Spinnaker Exploration gained 3.55 to 40.50. Credit Suisse First Boston, which 
had cut its rating on the Houston natural-gas concern last month, returned 
its strong buy rating on the stock.

INDIA: Enron prepares to move execs out of India - paper.

05/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, May 10 (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant Enron Corp has begun a process 
of relocating executives overseeing its controversy-wracked $2.9 billion 
power project in India, an Indian financial daily said on Thursday. 
The Economic Times said company sources, which it did not name, said the 
Houston-based company was preparing to offer its dozen managers in India a 
choice of transfering elsewhere or accepting a lump sum to retire.
""Unfortunately, the company could not pursue its projects in India, and has 
decided to fold up its operations in the country,"" the newspaper quoted an 
unnamed Enron official as saying. 
The report also said: ""The whole process of relocating the Indian staff is 
expected to be completed within a month or two."" 
An Enron spokesman declined comment, saying it was company policy not to 
comment on administrative and personnel matters. 
On Wednesday another domestic daily, the Times of India, reported that the 
families of executives overseeing Enron's troubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC) 
project in India were leaving the country. 
It said the children of Enron executives had been pulled out of the American 
School in Bombay as their families were being relocated to Singapore. 
It also said security around the expatriate executives had been tightened, 
and personal bodyguards assigned to senior executives, because ""there is 
likely to be a tremendous backlash"" if the project is terminated, causing the 
loss of 15,000 jobs. 
The Economic Times report on Thursday noted that Enron had already pulled out 
of all the other projects in India in which it once planned to invest. 
Metgas, which was to build a liquefied natural gas pipeline in the state of 
Maharashtra, and Enron Broadband Solutions, which was to lay an optic fibre 
cable network across the country, have virtually folded up operations, the 
newspaper said. 
""The other group company, Enron Oil & Gas (India), which is a joint venture 
between Reliance and ONGC, is currently in the process of selling its stake,"" 
it added. 
Enron has also scrapped plans to invest in other power projects in India, due 
to financial problems encountered by its nearly complete 2,184 MW power plant 
south of Bombay. 
The project is mired in controversy after the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board (MSEB) reneged on its commitment to buy all the power produced by the 
giant plant, saying it is too costly. 
MSEB has also defaulted on monthly payments to DPC for the electricity it has 
taken, forcing the company's board last month to authorise the management to 
terminate the contract.

India: A rational renegotiation plan

05/10/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

Separating the LNG project from the power project would reduce the tariffs 
for the latter, but not remove the financial hurdles for the State and the 
Centre. They would continue to pay more for the LNG project and guarantee its 
loans. DPC is now recovering the cost of the LNG project from the power 
project. Therefore, the mere segregation of the LNG project without 
readjusting the PPA or delinking the sovereign guarantee obligations would 
only help DPC and not the people of Maharashtra, says S. Padmanabhan. 
THE MAHARASHTRA Government recently announced its plans to renegotiate the 
Enron-promoted Dabhol power project. In this connection, Mr R. K. Pachouri, a 
committee member appointed for the renegotiation, outlined the priorities of 
the project in a television interview:
- To reduce the interest rate for the project debt of DPC to be in line with 
the current market trends; 
- To achieve higher output and identify power purchasers outside Maharashtra; 
and 
- To separate the LNG project from the power project. 
A business daily on May 2 reported that Indian Oil plans to supply 1.2 
million tonnes of naphtha to DPC at around the international price of $290 a 
tonne, including sales tax of 16-18 per cent per tonne. 
The report indicates that DPC has requested the Maharashtra Government to 
waive the sales tax so that the reduction in the sales tax can be passed on 
to the consumers. 
Similar news reports on the project have started appearing in both the print 
and visual media. These indicate that the State Government and the DPC 
management seem to have come to an understanding on the broad principles of 
renegotiation and both are in the process of educating the public about the 
benefits these various measures would bring to the project. 
No doubt, these steps would bring down the tariff. But, then, the reduction 
will be due to concessions and subsidies offered by the State and the 
financial institutions by way of waiver of sales tax and reduction in 
interest rate. It appears that DPC will not offer any reduction or concession 
offered in the tariff or the rate of returns. 
Reduction in project debt: When the DPC loans were sanctioned, the prime 
lending rate was around 14 per cent and the power projects were offered loans 
at 3-3.5 per cent over the PLR. Now the PLR is around 12.5 per cent and the 
interest rates for the power sector will be 15-15.5 per cent. Effectively, 
there would be a reduction of around 1.5-2 per cent in the interest rate. 
However, it must be noted that the same refinancing opportunity is good for 
every other Indian project. 
If the Centre permits refinancing for DPC, it should permit projects in other 
States as well to be refinanced. If it does, that will be at a considerable 
loss to the FIs such as the IDBI, the IFCI and the ICICI. 
To achieve higher output and identify power purchasers outside Maharashtra: 
This is not a tariff- reduction exercise. In fact, this would help DPC 
improve its profits and cash flows under the present PPA. DPC has a single- 
point tariff which consists of a fixed and a variable charge. Higher the 
output the DPC recovers, higher the fixed charges and higher the profits. 
Thus, without any significant changes in the existing PPA, this step would 
help DPC, and put more States in trouble. 
Perhaps, the renegotiating committee wants other States to sink as well with 
Maharashtra. 
To separate the LNG project from the power project: This is a welcome step. 
While it would reduce the tariff for the power project, it would not remove 
the financial hurdles for the State and the Centre, which would continue to 
be paying more for the LNG project and guaranteeing the loans of the LNG 
project. DPC is now recovering all the cost of the LNG project from the 
Dabhol project, which will consume only around 2.5 million tonnes of LNG, 
whereas the capacity of the LNG project is being upgraded to five million 
tonnes. Therefore, the mere segregation of the LNG project without 
readjusting the PPA or delinking the sovereign guarantee obligations does not 
serve the purpose. It would help DPC and not the people of Maharashtra. 
To exempt sales tax on naphtha: This is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. As 
IOC suggested, if $290 is the price of naphtha per tonne, it works out to Rs 
13,630 (one $ = Rs 47). Given that DPC gets paid fuel cost per kWh at 2,000 
kcal (heat rate) and the naphtha has a heat value of 11,000 kcal, one tonne 
of the fuel will give DPC fuel price for 5,500 kWh, that is at the rate of Rs 
2.48 per kWh for naphtha. 
If sales tax of 16 per cent is exempted from this price, the naphtha price 
drops to Rs 11,750 and the per kWh fuel price for DPC drops to Rs 2.14 from 
Rs 2.48. IOC expects to supply 1.2 million tonnes of naphtha for producing 
6,600 million kWh and the sales tax exemption effect will be Rs 225 crore 
(0.34 per kWh). 
What is DPC's contribution in this reduction? On the same account, every 
power project would seek to reduce the sales tax on the fuel they use. 
Remember that if the State sacrifices revenue in one area, it will recover 
the loss through some other taxes. When the current trend is to remove 
subsidies in all the sectors, the State and the renegotiating committee are 
opening up new subsidies to support DPC. 
An alternative 
The renegotiating committee should reduce the real tariffs from DPC's fixed 
costs, rather than making cosmetic changes in the taxation structure. 
The following steps are needed: 
- To remove the corporate veil protecting the DPC project documents: 
The public at large are paying for the revenues of DPC and no government can 
have the right to keep a veil of secrecy on the documents. This will help the 
public at large and the experts in the industry understand the implications 
and suggest viable alternatives. 
- To change DPC tariff formula from a single-part to two-part tariff: 
The Centre has a two-part tariff policy which stipulates recovery of fixed 
cost under certain circumstances. The most critical issue of this policy is 
the recovery of all fixed costs at a capacity utilisation (PLF) at 75 per 
cent. DPC has adopted a single part tariff system where the fixed costs are 
paid for all capacities and, thus the return of DPC increases as the capacity 
utilisation rises. While this method may promote efficiency, DPC has tied the 
State in tight knots with this higher capacity utilisation and, will make 
very high levels of profits. Therefore, it is essential that the single-part 
tariff is renegotiated at lower levels or better still scrapped and two-part 
tariff adopted. 
Renegotiating the station heat rate: DPC has a station heat rate of 2000 kcal 
per kWh. Thus, for every unit of electricity it produces the fuel - naphtha - 
it is reimbursed to DPC at the rate of 2,000 kcal per kWh. At $290 per tonne 
(Rs 13,630 at one $ = Rs 47) of IOC price this works out to Rs 2.48 per kWh. 
DPC uses GE 9FA machines-gas turbines which burn naphtha at around 1,700 kcal 
per kWh. In other words, DPC uses 1,700 kcal of naphtha and gets paid for 
2,000 kcal. 
Thus, it spends Rs 2.11 per kWh on fuel but gets paid Rs 2.48 per kWh, making 
a profit of Rs 0.37 for every kWh. On 2,100 MW at 80 per cent capacity, this 
is a whopping Rs 550 crore. While there may be technical grounds to pay at a 
level higher than 1,700 kcal due to considerations of part load, there is no 
justification for paying at 2,000 kcal. In fact, the Centre and the CEA as 
well as other States have been successfully forcing all power producers to 
reduce from the 2,000 kcal levels while Maharashtra has not been able to do 
this. 
This is a key issue in negotiations. 
To source naphtha only from domestic sources: India has a surplus of naphtha 
as of now and there is no need to import it. DPC should be forced to buy fuel 
only from domestic sources so that the profits remain with domestic 
companies, and not allow DPC to make higher profits of fuel handling. 
What if renegotiation fails? 
DPC will not agree to changes in the PPA as it would feel that it is a signed 
and sealed document. Maharashtra may look at cosmetic changes, and may make 
sacrifices to reduce the tariff. But in the long run, the contract will run 
aground because of the inability of the State Government to use and pay for 
the power produced by DPC. 
Given the background of Enron worldwide, it would press ahead with its 
perceived advantages - legal and contractual. It is better for the State to 
ready a back-up action plan. The following line of action is suggested: 
- To terminate the PPA and other project contracts and give notice to Enron 
to wind up operations; 
- To inform the lenders, the beneficiaries of the sovereign guarantee, that 
the Centre will pay up its commitments. Perhaps, this may involve setting up 
an escrow account and placing sufficient debt reserve funds that the lenders 
may request, pending final payments; 
- To quickly move towards an arbitration process primarily to d etermine the 
amounts payable to Enron towards contract termination; 
- To initiate an international competitive tendering process, with the 
permission of the lenders, to sell the power project and the LNG terminal as 
independent projects - the process should also permit bids from Indian 
companies; 
- To make a serious effort to complete the bid finalisation and selection of 
the successful bidder in two-three months; 
- The bidding process should have two parameters for the bidders to quote: 
a) tariff payable to the bidder for the next 20 years (in the case of LNG 
terminal - price of gas on long term basis); 
b) price for the assets; 
c) The bid would attract several international power players including 
American companies for the power and the LNG projects and the bids offered 
will be attractive. Also Indian companies or consortia would line up for the 
bid; 
d) Simultaneous with this exercise, as soon as determination of amounts 
payable to Enron becomes clear, to place the funds so determined and accepted 
with an escrow agent acceptable to Enron; 
e) To set up an investigating team to go into the approval process to 
determine whether there has been any corrupt practice in the process of 
granting approvals. There is a Supreme Court case (filed by CITU) pending 
decision on charges of corruption. The investigating team to focus, with the 
cooperation of the US Government, on the issues relating to Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act (FCPA) of the US. Violation of the FCPA by any American 
corporate is a serious issue attracting criminal prosecution. There can be a 
time bound investigation; 
f) To proceed with the prosecution of all people concerned if found guilty - 
if Enron is found guilty the compensations may not be payable and the US law 
agencies will step in to prosecute Enron; 
j) If Enron is not found guilty, to pay the monies due to it by releasing the 
amounts in escrow. By this time the asset takeover and the debt repayment 
issues would have been resolved; 
k) Conservatively, it is believed that there would be an ultimate gap of 
$1,000 million (Rs 4,700 crore at one $ = Rs 47) after the assets are sold 
and debts transferred to the new owners. It is suggested that the State float 
a public debt issue for paying this to Enron and levy an 'Enron Cess' to 
recover the loss and repay the debt issue over the next 15-20 years. At a 
return of 10 per cent per annum on Rs 4,700 crore over the next 15 years and 
assuming that 100 per cent of the loss is recovered from the 2,100 MW project 
and assuming an 80 per cent PLF, the 'Enron Cess' per kWh of energy produced 
will be Rs 0.42. 
But will the Central and State governments have the political will to force 
this issue?

BANGALORE, May 9. THE Centre has conveyed that it would support the 
Maharashtra Government on the contentious issue of tariff renegotiations with 
Enron for power purchase from Dabhol Power Company (DPC). 
Talking to newspersons here on Wednesday, the Union Minister for Power, Mr 
Suresh Prabhu, said the Centre had already appointed the Solicitor-General of 
India as its nominee in the panel set up by the Maharashtra State Government 
headed by Mr Madhav Godbole to renegotiate the terms of the power purchase 
agreement. Enron's executives were due to meet the panel on May 11 in this 
connection, he added.
Replying to questions on Enron's proposals to exit from DPC, he said that 
neither the Maharashtra Government nor Enron had conveyed their desire to 
exit from DPC. ""We will support the State Government,"" he emphasised. He said 
that the Centre was not in a position to intervene in the matter since it was 
for Enron to take a decision on the issue. 
However, the Centre's counter guarantee liabilities in DPC would be confined 
to the extent of the State Government's payment defaults. 
Earlier speaking at the inauguration of CII institute of quality, he said 
that the Centre's new focus was on conservation of power rather than adding 
fresh capacity. 
The Karnataka Chief Minister, Mr S.M. Krishna, who was also present, said 
that WTO's impact on the agriculture sector needed to be addressed and said 
that the Prime Minister should call a meeting of the Chief Ministers to 
discuss the outcome of the WTO and future steps that needed to be taken. 
He added that the Congress had initiated reforms - liberalisation and 
globalisation - and there was no intention of retreating on them. 
However, it was necessary to have a mid-term appraisal on them. Dr K. 
Kasturirangan, Chairman, Indian Space Research Organisation said, ""Behind 
every successful company is a quality culture, and that in the unforgiving 
environment of space strict quality awareness was very essential and any 
violation would mean that we have to pay heavily in space."" 
He added that space had given to the world configuration, control and 
management and in the Rs 1,000 crore GSLV programme, over 10,000 computer 
simulations had been done in th last six-seven years, before it was 
considered flight worthy. 
Almost 1000 major reviews were done and input collected not only from senior 
engineers, but from youngsters too, ""as their minds are fresh. 
We worked towards transparency and fairly and frankly exchanged ideas. 
Around half a million a A-4 size papers documentation was done on the 
programme,"" he added.

The Centre has asked the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) to seek 
legal advice on the letter issued by the international lenders to Enron 
seeking a series of demands from the Maharashtra and central government. 
In a communication to the financial institution, the finance ministry has 
said that a decision to provide escrow cover and increase the limit under 
letter of credit to Dabhol Power Company as per the demand of the energy 
major's global and domestic lenders last week, can only be taken after 
considering all the relevant issues.
In the reply, also sent to the Maharashtra government, the ministry has also 
referred to the state government's refusal to tow the line on the demands put 
forward by the lenders in a letter to the finance secretary, Ajit Kumar. 
The lenders to Enron including ABN-Amro, Credit Suisse First Boston, Citibank 
N A, ANZ Export Finance Ltd and Banc Of America had asked for payment of the 
disputed Rs 213 crore towards December and January bills plus an escrow cover 
and an increase in the letter of credit amount. 
It had also asked the Centre to honour the counter guarantees and its 
obligations in the power purchase agreement. 
Meanwhile, the state yesterday appointed Singapore-based lawyer Quentin Loh 
as its representative for the three arbitration cases and MSEB would be 
represented by former Bombay High Court judge ML Pendse.

USA: CEOs urge major moves to deal with energy crisis.
By Jeremy Pelofsky

05/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va., May 9 (Reuters) - In fear of the unpredictable 
power outages in California, Scott McNealy, the chief executive at computer 
giant Sun Microsystems Inc. , has resorted to carrying a flashlight with him 
at all times. 
Plus, the network computer maker will be $8 million to $9 million over the 
annual budget for its facilities in California because of high energy costs, 
he said Wednesday at the chief executive summit known as the Business Council.
""I don't know about you but I carry a flashlight everywhere I go,"" McNealy 
said. ""We've got third world power out there."" 
California's summer of blackouts could cost its economy almost $22 billion in 
lost productivity and chop as many as 135,000 jobs in the state, according to 
an industry association study released Wednesday. 
With energy prices expected to soar as the year progresses, the executives 
surveyed by the Business Council, an association of corporate executives, 
urged further liberalization of the energy market and sought new incentives 
for exploration. 
""Consensus expectations are for higher petroleum and electricity costs over 
the balance of this year,"" said J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Inc. executive 
William Harrison. 
The blackouts - the most visible result of an energy crisis caused by 
California's disastrous 1996 experiment with power market deregulation - are 
forecast to continue through the summer as warm temperatures keep air 
conditioning demand high. 
The industry groups that commissioned the study hope to use it to campaign 
against a new, tiered power rate structure being considered by the California 
Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which they claim will pass too much of 
the burden of paying for California's energy crisis on to industrial 
customers. 
That rate proposal, officially put forward Wednesday, would slap residential 
customers who use the most electricity with average rate hikes of between 35 
and 40 percent, while industrial users could face rate hikes of 50 percent or 
more. 
Kenneth Lay, chairman of Enron Corp. , the biggest buyer and seller of 
electricity in North America, said California could pay from $50 billion to 
$80 billion this summer for electricity. 
""The biggest impact will be the disruptions in that economy if in fact we 
have a normally warm or even warmer than normal summer,"" Lay said. ""There's 
still a lot of things that have to be done."" 
He said there has to be a complete plan to solving the crisis and the longer 
the state waits, the more money that will be paid out. Lay also urged for 
more steps to promote energy conservation. 
""I think it's a very solvable problem, it just cannot be solved without some 
pain,"" Lay said. ""Finally they're raising rates ... and at least correcting 
some of the problems."" 
Sun's McNealy said there must also be another look at building nuclear power 
plants. 
In the meantime, he quipped that while Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sun has a 
dress code requiring employees to come to work in clothes, that may change. 
""We're thinking of backing that off a bit or even encouraging people to wear 
shorts because we're cranking up the thermostats,"" he said.

USA: INTERVIEW-Enron CEO sees gasoline prices staying high.

05/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va., May 9 (Reuters) - Consumers will not likely get 
any relief at the gas pumps this summer but prices are not expected to hit $3 
a gallon as some have forecast, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay told Reuters 
on Wednesday. 
Gasoline inventories have been rising in recent weeks, more than was 
expected, which could hold prices from skyrocketing, Lay told Reuters in an 
interview on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the Business Council in 
the mountains of West Virginia.
""Hopefully they will not go up as much as people feared,"" he said, adding 
that he ""would not be surprised if they go up a little bit."" 
The Energy Information Agency said the national retail gasoline price hit a 
new record high of $1.70 a gallon on Monday and could climb to $1.75 this 
summer with demand expected to grow despite the increase. 
EIA warned that current gasoline inventories, which have risen recently but 
remain below historical levels, set the stage for fuel supply disruptions 
that could result in price spikes this summer. 
Lay said that holding down summer gas prices will largely depend on whether 
there are any disruptions at refineries across the country and the flow of 
imports from abroad. 
""But with normal refinery runs, and imports and all the rest of it, hopefully 
the market will not get too far out of balance,"" he said. 
""We'll probably not see much softness in the gasoline prices either until 
back in the fall some time,"" Lay said.

SMARTMONEY.COM: Power Surge
By Roben Farzad

05/09/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Talk about vindication. In the late 1990s, when tech 
was shooting through the roof, no one wanted to waste their time in the 
greasy, sweaty world of oil and gas stocks. The fact that energy prices were 
touching multiyear lows at the time didn't help. In those days, being an 
energy analyst was the loneliest of callings. 
Needless to say, things have changed. Last year, power shortages and record 
oil and gas prices sent the once forsaken group of energy stocks soaring 
while investors ran screaming from the likes of Cisco Systems (CSCO), Intel 
(INTC) and the B2B flavor of the month. Suddenly, energy experts were the 
life of the party.
So dramatic was the rotation that unearthing value plays has become 
difficult. The Dow Jones U.S. Energy Index, for example, is up 18% in the 
last year, while the American Stock Exchange Natural Gas Index has soared 33% 
- compared with the Standard & Poor's 500's 12% drop. 
But that doesn't mean finding underappreciated stocks is impossible. It just 
takes some, well, drilling down. 
Start with Houston-based fuel exploration and producer Apache (APA), a 
SmartMoney.com favorite stubbornly trading at a 21% discount to its 52-week 
high of $74 set last December. In March, Robert Hunter noted that natural-gas 
prices would likely continue to spike into 2001 even after quadrupling 
between 1999 and 2000. So far, that scenario has played out, yet Apache still 
trades at a 33% discount to its 2001 estimated net asset value, while sector 
rivals currently trade at a more reasonable 15% to 20% discount to their 
NAVs. Moreover, the stock presently changes hands at just 12 times forward 
earnings - a hefty discount to its historical Cisco-like multiple of 66. 
Why the disconnect? Admittedly stumped, the oil and gas analyst community - 
which is almost uniformly positive on Apache - concedes that investors have a 
difficult time believing the gas industry's ""perfect storm"" combination of 
all-time high prices, low reserves and high demand will last. Brad Beago of 
Credit Lyonnais points out that the market is pricing the stock as if oil 
were trading in the low $20s per barrel and gas at $3 per million cubic feet, 
instead of the $28 and $4.50, respectively, they fetch now. What's more, 
Apache's well-known growth-by-acquisition strategy has scared away investors 
who fear that a sudden collapse in commodity prices could torpedo the 
company's business model. 
Such thinking could be a mistake. In the past decade, Apache has spent more 
than $10 billion to snap up reserves and production facilities at low prices, 
a work in progress that has created a rock-solid asset portfolio with 
consistent revenue streams. Recently, the company put the finishing touches 
on $1.4 billion in high-profile property acquisitions from the Spanish 
concern Repsol and the Australian Fletcher Challenge, deals that have 
produced, among other things, gushing oil yields in Egypt and Canada. 
""Historically, Apache has done an exceptionally good job on the acquisition 
side,"" says Kenneth Beer of New Orleans-based Johnson Rice. ""The upside,"" he 
adds, ""now comes from the maturation of their exploration program."" 
Another intriguing energy play: Williams Cos. (WMB). Known as the poor man's 
Enron (ENE), the $19 billion Tulsa, Okla.-based energy powerhouse has a hand 
in virtually all areas of the business - gas and oil transportation, 
gathering, exploration, refining, power marketing and energy trading, to name 
just a few. And like Apache, Williams has been aggressive lately. On Monday, 
the company snarled off suitor Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) by paying $2.5 
billion for Denver natural-gas producer Barrett Resources (BRR), a deal that 
not only will be immediately accretive to earnings but also effectively 
doubles Williams' proven gas stockpile. 
On the accounting front, first-quarter revenues at Williams surged 63% 
year-over-year to $3.09 billion, while earnings from continuing operations 
shot up to $378.3 million from $138.9 million. Yet Williams' stock, currently 
around $39, trades at a 21% discount to its 52-week high of $48.13 set last 
August, and just 14 times estimated 2002 earnings. Since rich cousin and 
industry standard-bearer Enron trades at 27 times forward earnings, analysts 
who cover Williams think the stock is long overdue for a pop. 
Finally, investors looking to increase their exposure to the energy sector 
should consider the booming area of power generation, an industry that has 
consolidated a frightening amount of clout in the disastrously deregulated 
state of California and elsewhere. Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine (CPN) 
does the dirty work of generating and selling electricity to utilities and 
other third parties. Ironically, the company's two primary fuel sources for 
its turbines - natural gas and geothermal - actually make for some of the 
cleanest electricity production around. 
And Calpine's numbers suggest that green (or at least greener) can be good 
from a profitability standpoint. For the three months ended March 31, 
revenues skyrocketed to $1.23 billion from $235.4 million, with net income 
surging fivefold to $93.7 million. First-quarter earnings per share of 30 
cents beat the Street by six cents and persuaded the analyst community to 
predict decidedly un-utility-like 45% to 50% annual EPS growth for the 
company for the next five years. 
While Calpine's healthy 2002 price-to-earnings ratio of 23 is in line with 
that of the S&P 500, political momentum is certainly on the company's side. 
The Bush administration has taken a hands-off approach to the California 
energy crisis, leaving it in the lap of Democratic governor Gray Davis of 
California. Still reeling from the bankruptcy of PG&E, the Davis 
administration is left with little power aside from exhortation to compel 
generators like Calpine to give the state's financially strapped utilities a 
break. As California's rolling blackouts make front-page news again this 
summer, it will become increasingly clear to Americans that new power plants 
are needed to meet our growing energy demand - 1,900 over the next two 
decades, according to Vice President Dick Cheney. Flush with cash and 
proceeds from the capital markets, Calpine is all too happy to come to the 
rescue. 
With growth prospects like these, Calpine - along with its underappreciated 
cousins Apache and Williams - could make for some exciting talk around the 
candle-lit water cooler his summer.

India: No To Guarantees For Enron Power Project -Report

05/09/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Finance Ministry has upheld the Maharashtra 
state government's decision not to extend financial guarantees sought by 
lenders to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) controversial Dabhol Power Co., the Press 
Trust of India, quoting state government sources, reported late Wednesday. 
The federal government upheld the state government's decision not to provide 
escrow cover or increase the limit of a letter of credit, the Press Trust 
said.
The Finance Ministry's response, in a letter to the Maharashtra government, 
followed demands for the guarantees by the $3 billion power-plant project's 
global and domestic lenders, the Press Trust reported. 
Enron spokesman John Ambler in Houston couldn't confirm that a letter had 
been sent and said it would be inappropriate to comment. 
The 2,184-megawatt project - India's single largest foreign investment - has 
been mired in financial disputes since the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board, its main customer, failed to pay several bills. Under a 1996 
counter-guarantee agreement, the federal government is obliged to pay Enron 
when MSEB defaults. 
According to the Press Trust, the consortium of lenders asked in a May 1 
letter to Finance Secretary Ajit Kumar for payment of the disputed 2.13 
billion rupees ($1=INR46.8325) in power bills from December and January, 
activation of escrow cover and an increase in the letter of credit amount. 
The lenders also asked the federal government to Honiara its counter 
guarantees to Dabhol Power under the power purchase agreement with 
Maharashtra State. 
The lenders are ABN Amro (ABN), Credit Suisse First Boston (Z.CSF), Citibank 
NA (C), ANZ Export Finance Ltd, Bank of America (BAC) and the Industrial 
Development Bank of India. 
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to Dabhol charging INR7.1 a kilowatt-hour for its power, 
compared with INR1.5/kWh charged by other suppliers. 
As reported, a nine-member state committee headed by retired federal Home 
Secretary Madhav Godbole is working to lower the DPC's power tariff and allow 
the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A 
restructuring of the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. The 
Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised 
agreement within a month. 
The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt naphtha plant contributing about 
0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron has maintained that work will be 
completed by the year-end in the second phase of the Dabhol project that will 
add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant will switch from naphtha to liquefied 
natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. 
Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest 
shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General 
Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each.

25 Leaders for a Dangerous Time

05/14/2001
Business Week
EB24
(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

The Internet forced a revolution in the way companies are managed. For the 
CEOs of upstarts and Old Economy players alike, the focus has been on making 
decisions in a heartbeat, innovating fast, and looking for ways to tap the 
Net to reach new customers and streamline operations. Now we're in the midst 
of what experts say could be the biggest tech slowdown in 15 years. With the 
pressure on to cut costs and meet quarterly earnings expectations, what's a 
CEO to do? 
Ask our e.biz 25. These are the most influential people in 
e-business--everybody from empire builders like AOL Time Warner Chairman 
Steve Case to Monica Luechtefeld, executive vice-president of e-commerce at 
retailer Office Depot. Those two have wisely built bridges between the worlds 
of bricks and clicks. Their advice is bold: Don't just hunker down and try to 
wait it out. Invest, build, develop new products, and prepare for the 
upswing. Technology and the Internet may not be growing licketysplit, but 
they aren't going away. Says Jeffrey K. Skilling, CEO of Enron Corp., one of 
our 25: ``A lot of people will pull back. They will be missing tremendous 
opportunities. Those with capital and talent should push forward and widen 
the lead.''
Doing this in the face of a trigger-happy Wall Street will require dynamic 
leadership and cast-iron stomachs. We've got that on our e.biz 25. These are 
the pioneers, the people with the new ideas, the out-of-box thinkers, and the 
survivors--especially the survivors--who will shape e-business for years to 
come. 
Some of our 25 have been on the list before. Michael Dell, CEO of Dell 
Computer Corp., for one. He's a pioneer who has used the Net to reach 
customers and revamp his supply chain. Now, in the midst of the downturn, 
Dell is turning up the heat on competitors by slashing prices ruthlessly. 
Thanks to his foundation of Net technologies, Dell can do this and still make 
a profit. The result could be a massive restructuring of the PC industry, 
with some of Dell's competitors losing market share at a gallop. 
Others land on the list because of their potential for shaking up the status 
quo. Example: Rick Belluzzo, Microsoft Corp.'s president. Microsoft has been 
ho-hum on the Net--until now. Belluzzo has turned Microsoft's MSN into the 
No. 2 portal on the Web, and now the company is committed to spending $2 
billion this year on research & development for its .Net strategy for 
supercharging the Web. It may well make the Net more useful--and easier to 
use. And Microsoft could leapfrog from laggard to leader. 
Then there are the folks whose future is very much in doubt--and that makes 
them even more important to watch. Squarely on the e.biz hot seat sits Jeff 
Bezos of e-tailer Amazon.com Inc. With the online superstore's revenue growth 
slowing and its $15 stock off its peak by 85%, the man who scared the bejesus 
out of the nation's traditional retailers isn't so terrifying now. But he's 
still the trailblazer of e-tailing. Whether he fails miserably or triumphs in 
the end, how he fares will tell us much about the next episode in the 
Internet saga. ``This is a good time to learn, to explore, to get ready,'' 
says Rosabeth M. Kanter, professor at Harvard Business School. 
Indeed, economic slumps have been launchpads for companies who know how to 
take advantage of them. The outfits that are likely to pick up momentum in 
this downturn are the companies that create or adopt new technology, 
experiment with new business models, and expand aggressively. That's 
certainly been true in the past. During the 1990-91 recession, EMC Corp. 
focused on high-end storage technologies and innovated its way through hard 
times. Chrysler retooled its design process and began farming out component 
manufacturing to partners--and was the only one of the Big Three to post a 
profit in 1992. Arrow Electronics bought smaller competitors and expanded in 
Europe, emerging as the No. 1 electronics distributor in the world. 
``Slowdowns can be a great opportunity for companies that are prepared. It's 
time for the strong to get stronger, and for the relatively weak to get 
stronger, too,'' says Orit Gadiesh, Chairman of consulting firm Bain & Co. 
The Internet's early winners focused on boosting sales. But during a 
downturn, that's not nearly enough. The Net can be used to supercharge every 
aspect of a company's operations, from market research and customer service 
to engineering collaboration and linking up suppliers. Consider e.biz 25 
member Pradeep Sindhu, co-founder of Juniper Networks Inc. He used this 
wall-to-wall approach to make his four-year-old upstart the leader in 
high-end network routers. It was built from the ground up to capitalize on 
the Net. The company takes orders over the Web and automatically passes them 
to contract manufacturers who make and ship the products. This frees Juniper 
to concentrate on designing products that trounce the competition. The 
payoff: Juniper's operating margin hovers around 30%, nearly double the 
average in the hardware business. 
The most successful e-businesses don't just chase the latest hot idea. They 
figure out which technologies are really right for them. Gary M. Reiner, 
chief information officer at General Electric Co., one of our e.biz 25, 
turned up his nose when many industrial companies joined consortiums that set 
up public e-marketplaces. GE has instant economies of scale with its 11 
different businesses, so it can reap huge savings by combining all their 
buying into the company's own private e-marketplace. GE expects to save $600 
million on procurement over the Web in 2001. 
Many established companies rapidly spun off independent Internet divisions, 
and for some--NBC, for example--that turned out to be a mistake. The latest 
thinking is that companies like retailer Office Depot got it right. It set up 
an independent organization, run by Luechtefeld, but its bricks and clicks 
are cemented together. For instance, customers who need something immediately 
can check online to see if the item is in stock at their local Office Depot. 
The company logged $850 million in online sales last year, making it the No. 
2 online retailer after Amazon.com 
In a downturn, charismatic leadership is more important than ever. With 
revenues sinking and stock options underwater, workers need reasons to 
believe. ``You have to persuade people to stay with you for the ride,'' says 
Haim Mendelson, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. 
While most companies are laying off, some, like Sun Microsystems Inc., pledge 
to do so only as a last resort. CEO Scott McNealy, one of our e.biz 25, 
believes layoffs break a social contract with employees. By holding back, 
``we're protecting the long-term shareholder value,'' he says. 
For CEOs who have been the company's visionaries during the Net's go-go 
years, now is the time to buckle down and pay attention to operations. It's 
advice that Amazon's Bezos takes to heart. The company's goal is to post an 
operating profit--excluding special charges--in the fourth quarter. He's 
concentrating on operating efficiencies. And he's using Net technology to get 
there. Right now, Amazon is installing a system that will automatically route 
e-mails from customers to the appropriate service representative, saving time 
and money. 
Bean-counting may be back, but so is fear. And leaders who let themselves be 
ruled by fear won't be able to handle the balancing act that's required of 
them in these difficult times. ``Some people pay lip service to the 
principles of leadership, but they flush it away when they're running 
scared,'' says Raymond Miles, professor emeritus at the Haas School of 
Business at the University of California at Berkeley. These 25 show no sign 
of turning tail.

JEFFREY SKILLING 
Enron Corp., President and CEO 
CONTRIBUTION: Thanks to the Net, he transformed Enron into North America's 
largest energy marketer. He's trading everything from paper to metals online 
to the tune of $162 billion in the first quarter. 
CHALLENGE: Get new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by 
proving bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. 
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey K. Skilling likes to say that the 
nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there 
was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities such as 
electricity and natural gas--by phone or fax--was a natural fit for the Web. 
Over the past year, Enron has taken online trading to a new level, harnessing 
the Web to bring Enron's risk-management prowess to everything from metals to 
high-speed communications. ``Our volumes are way up,'' says Skilling. 
Try through the roof. EnronOnline handles 5,000 transactions per day. The 
company posts prices on more than 1,500 products that it stands ready to buy 
or sell to utilities, municipalities, and other big wholesale customers. 
Since November, 1999, EnronOnline has traded more than $525 billion worth of 
commodities, making it the Web's biggest and most successful 
business-to-business site. 
Skilling's most challenging move: high-speed communications bandwidth. In the 
past year, Enron has spent $436 million to create its own 15,000-mile 
fiber-optic network to provide real-time bandwidth to customers. Because of a 
supply glut and falling prices, bandwidth trading is struggling. In March, 
Enron suffered a major blow with the abrupt cancellation of its 
video-on-demand pact with Blockbuster Inc. Skilling says the deal was called 
off because Blockbuster wasn't getting movies from Hollywood studios fast 
enough. 
Such setbacks don't faze Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant who 
graduated in the top 5% of his Harvard Business School class. He sees almost 
no limit to what Enron can trade--even ad space is a possibility. ``The Net 
allows you to touch lots of customers inexpensively,'' he says. Not bad for 
mere commodities. 


USA: El Paso opens bids to expand Calif. natgas lines.

05/11/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, May 11 (Reuters) - El Paso Corp. said Friday two of its units are to 
test the market's appetite to expand capacity on two natural gas lines into 
energy-starved California, where gas prices are the highest in the nation. 
El Paso unit El Paso Natural Gas Company started taking open bids May 1 and 
will close its so-called open season on May 25 for new capacity on a proposed 
two-way line between Daggett, Calif. and Ehrenberg, Ariz., El Paso said in a 
statement.
El Paso unit Mojave Pipeline Co. is also holding an open season from May 10 
to May 31 for its Sacramento Valley project, which would add capacity along 
an expanded Mojave pipeline system from Topock, Ariz., to Antioch and 
Sacramento in Northern California. 
No estimates were immediately available as to how much capacity El Paso, the 
largest supplier of natural gas to California, was considering adding to each 
system, an El Paso spokeswoman said. 
El Paso currently delivers more than 3 trillion cubic feet of gas a day, or 
about 45 percent, to California through four receiving points at the 
California-Arizona border. 
The El Paso open seasons are the latest in a flurry of market activity to 
expand or build new natural gas pipelines California, where demand for 
natural gas is expected to surge to meet demand from a growing number of 
gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for construction. 
Natural gas is already used to generate about a third of California's 
electrcity. 
Since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Sempra Energy unit 
Southern California Gas Co, Williams Cos' Kern River Transmission, Pacific 
Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, Questar Corp. , Calpine 
Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Software Promises Bandwidth Broker In A Box
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

05/11/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Call it a bandwidth broker in a box. 
That's perhaps the easiest way to describe the promise of Invisible Hand 
Networks Inc.'s Merkato software system.
Merkato, which the Burlington, Mass., company is planning to roll out in the 
coming months, assesses the amount of bandwidth being used on a network and 
then electronically offers the unneeded portion to others for sale. 
Like existing online bandwidth trading platforms, Merkato, named for the 
Italian word for marketplace, can be operated manually by the network 
operator. Unlike other online services it can operate automatically. 
""Bandwidth traders are trading circuits and they're trading circuits between 
carriers,"" said Invisible Hand Chief Executive Glenn Ricketts. ""True 
liquidity is not going to be created by carriers trading circuits."" 
Bandwidth traders and industry analysts are skeptical about Merkato living up 
to its promise for real-time, scalable bandwidth provisioning. 
""It's a solution in search of problem,"" said a bandwidth brokerage founder. 
""Algorithms shouldn't clear trades, people should - with algorithms 
supporting and advising their potential decisions."" 
Software Built On Algorithms 
Algorithms are at the heart of Merkato's operation. The algorithms were 
developed by Nemo Semret, one of the company's founders, while pursuing his 
Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Columbia University. 
Semret developed what's essentially a mathematical model using game theory 
and market economics for auctioning bandwidth, an instantly perishable 
commodity, Ricketts said. 
Merkato contacts other Merkato users to see if they are buying or selling 
bandwidth. It will then execute the trade automatically or it will come back 
to ask approval to execute the trade or seek more guidance if some of the 
conditions set for the trade aren't met. 
Software platforms like Enron Online or those provided by brokers require a 
person to set prices and execute the trade. 
""It'll be great if it works,"" said William Bandt, an analyst with Arthur 
Andersen L.L.P. ""The devil is in the details. This dynamic allocation could 
be a big deal."" 
One early user of Merkato, Thin Portals Network in New York, has been testing 
the software for three months. The company is a managed hosting and 
colocation facility. 
""It's a way to create an auction, a new market, very easily,"" said David 
Simon, head of Thin Portals. ""It's an exchange in a box. All you need is the 
product and the connectivity. It's just that easy."" 
Simon declined to say exactly how he plans to use Merkato. 
Invisible Hand hopes to license the Merkato software to carriers and 
bandwidth providers who want to sell excess capacity to their clients.

117,"Greetings Folks:

As you know, the Gas Accord is coming to an end and PG&E's trying to figure 
out where to go from here.  I would argue that what happens with PG&E is 
equally, if not more, important as what happens with SoCal.  

As you also know, we're faced with a retrograde PUC that, by all accounts, 
longs for the ""halcyon days"" of command-and-control regulation.  As such, I 
think it would be very useful, and cost-effective, to pull together the 
effective coalition we established in the SoCalGas settlement.  

In that coalition, some of us contributed dollars and some contributed 
experts.  I think we should employ that approach again.  I asked Mike Day, 
who I think most agree, did a pretty good job of representing us in the SoCal 
settlement, to make a proposal for representing us in the PG&E case.  Mike's 
proposal is attached.  Finally, if there's anyone else you think we ought to 
include in our coalition, please let me know.

Let me know what you think.

Hope all is well with you and yours.

Best,
Jeff

***************************************************************************





Jeff:

   Goodin, MacBride is willing and able to represent a coalition of
end-users, marketers, and other interested parties in the PG&E Gas Accord II
proceeding in much the same fashion that it represented multiple parties in
the GRI proceeding in both PG&E and SoCalGas settlements.  We would propose
to split our monthly billings for legal fees and expenses equally between
the parties who agree to join such a coalition.  In exchange for joining the
coalition, parties would receive frequent updates on the status of
settlement talks and other proceedings, participate in conference calls to
reach decisions on coalition positions, and have the ability to call on the
GMSRD lawyers on the case in order to answer specific questions or provide
any other useful information.  

   I envision using several attorneys for various portions of the
proceeding, including using associates and paralegals for research, and
other GMSRD partners with gas experience for preparation of pleadings, etc.
However, most of the face to face negotiating, including working with
Commissioners and advisors as necessary, would be done by myself as lead
partner on the case.  I have attached a fee schedule for the GMSRD attorneys
who would likely have some involvement in the case.  Because the majority of
this work will be done in 2001, these rates reflect our new 2001 hourly
fees.  However, in an effort to encourage participation in the coalition,
and because several potential members of the coalition are past or existing
clients, we propose to reduce our standard fees with a 15% discount for all
participants in the coalition.  With this discount, these would be the
lowest fees available to any of our clients in the coming year.

   I have not made any type of estimate of legal expenses for this
proceeding, as it is exceedingly difficult to forecast how protracted the
proceedings will be.  Once we begin participating in the proceeding and we
collectively decide how best to proceed in terms of actual participation in
the case, we can provide frequent budget reports and make more useful
budgetary estimates.  If you require some type of estimation sooner than
that, please let me know.

Thursday, May 3, 2001 
By Harrison Sheppard
Staff Writer 

Republican governors from throughout the country descended on Los Angeles on 
Wednesday to raise funds and take a few shots at Gov. Gray Davis' handling of 
the power crisis. 
While Davis already has a $25 million war chest for his re-election campaign 
next year, members of the Republican Governors Association said the energy 
crisis will make him vulnerable. 
""This is very severe and significant and impacts every person in the state,"" 
said Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut, the group's vice chairman. ""That's a 
governor's worst nightmare."" 
The governors said they will not get involved in picking or supporting a GOP 
gubernatorial candidate before the 2002 state primary, and will unite behind 
the Republican chosen by state voters. 
They also argued that it is up to California to work out its power problems, 
rather than seeking a bailout from President George W. Bush. 
""A federal government that can give you all that you want is capable of 
taking everything you have,"" said Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer, who specializes 
in energy issues for the Western Governors Association. 
Gov. Jane Dee Hull of Arizona added: ""California has not come forward to 
solve their own problems, and the federal government can only do so much."" 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the state wants the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission to impose price caps but that FERC has taken only ""baby 
steps"" in that direction. The Bush administration opposes price caps, saying 
they provide no inducement for increasing the electricity generating capacity 
in the state. 
""They need to step up to the plate,"" Maviglio said. ""What happens in 
California has a ripple effect throughout the country in terms of our 
economy."" 
Davis issued a statement noting that the energy crisis also affects the 
states of some of the Republican governors at the conference. 
""My fellow governors should look before they leap,"" Davis said. ""Eighty-five 
percent of the increased demand on the Western grid comes from states outside 
of California. 
""In California, I have approved 13 major power plants and signed into law 
$800 million worth of incentives for electricity conservation. The Western 
states would be well served if they worked as hard as California is in 
building power plants and conserving energy."" 
Rowland, the GOP governors' vice chairman, said the group expected to raise 
between $200,000 to $300,000 during the Los Angeles trip. Today, the group 
will head to San Jose. 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, a gubernatorial candidate and the only 
Republican to hold statewide office, attended the convention to schmooze with 
a group he hopes to join someday. He criticized Davis' attempt to acquire the

IssueAlert for  March 30, 2001 

FERC Chairman Curt HSbert Will Block Western Price Caps

by Will McNamara 
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News item from Energy Info Source] Reuters is reporting that Curt HSbert, 
FERC Chairman, said he would block a move by fellow commissioners to impose a 
temporary price cap on wholesale electricity prices in the western United 
States. HSbert reportedly said that even if a majority of the three member 
commission favored price caps, he would prevent a vote from being taken 
because he does not believe price curbs would increase electricity supplies 
or reduce demand in the region. ""Absent someone proving to me that price caps 
would bring more supply and less demand in California and the West, my answer 
is yes,"" HSbert said, when asked by reporters if he would block a FERC vote 
on western price caps. A FERC spokesman later downplayed HSbert's remarks. 
""He did not say he would block any vote,"" said FERC spokesman Hedley Burrell. 
""He said he would need to be shown that price caps would bring more supply or 
less demand to the West."" 

Analysis: Just last week, I discussed the growing dissension with the FERC 
over the price cap issue (see 3/21 IssueAlert). The dissension appears to be 
coming to a head, just as FERC grows from a three-member commission to its 
standard five members. As the philosophical complexion of the new FERC is 
unknown, it remains questionable whether or not HSbert's adamant stand 
against price caps will be sufficient to keep the commission from moving in 
this direction. HSbert's hard line against price caps was espoused during the 
same week that the FERC chairman appeared at a Santa Fe, N.M. conference and 
spoke about high wholesale prices in California and the fact that the state's 
utilities could have saved about $5 billion had they accepted proposals for 
long-term contracts six months ago. 

First, let's look at how the structure of FERC is presently changing and how 
this might impact the commission's divided position on price caps. On March 
27, President Bush announced his intention to nominate state utility 
officials Nora Mead Brownell of Pennsylvania and Patrick Wood III of Texas to 
serve on FERC. Word on the nomination of Wood was expected, although rumors 
had indicated that Wood might be named to replace HSbert as chairman. 
Brownell, a commissioner with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, 
will be appointed to the remainder of a five-year term that expires June 30 
of this year and an additional term expiring in 2006. Wood, who formerly 
served on FERC from 1991 to 1993, will be appointed to the remainder of a 
five-year term that expires in 2005.  

As I mentioned in the 3/21 IssueAlert, the FERC is presently divided on the 
issue of price caps. Obviously, HSbert has expressed strong opposition to any 
kind of restriction on pricing. However, Commissioner William Massey has said 
that he will continue to push for price caps to help calm the volatility of 
the California market. Linda Key Breathitt, the third commissioner presently 
at FERC, has remained undecided on the issue. What could change the balance 
of power at FERC with the two new appointments is the fact that both Brownell 
and Wood come from states in which some form of wholesale price caps are 
presently in place.  

Consequently, there is a real possibility that HSbert, despite his role as 
chairman, could soon find himself in the minority position with regard to the 
price cap issue. HSbert seems unconcerned about this possibility and has made 
reference to ""like-minded friends"" in Washington who would side with him on 
the issue.  

The rationale behind HSbert's opposition to price caps has been well 
documented. The FERC chairman has not been fully convinced that price caps 
would do anything to increase supply or reduce demand in the Western region, 
or anywhere else for that matter. Rather, HSbert believes that price caps 
have the potential to cause serious damage and actually cause supply to 
decrease further as power generators will opt to build plants in other 
regions that do not place restrictions on prices.  

The fact that HSbert opposes price caps but yet supports FERC's investigation 
into the ""unjust and unreasonable"" prices charged by power suppliers may seem 
like somewhat of a contradiction to some observers. Earlier this month, FERC 
put 13 California power sellers on notice that they must either make refunds 
for certain power sales or provide further justification of their prices. 
Total potential refunds or offsets in the ISO and PX markets are 
approximately $69 million for January 2001 transactions. Further, FERC 
established a price screen of $273/MWh that would be justified during periods 
of a Stage 3 alert, and that anything above this price would be considered 
excessive. In addition, the commission will determine a top wholesale power 
price for each month through April, and then formulate a permanent plan for 
monitoring prices in California for transactions taking place after May 1. 
FERC is utilizing a methodology to determine the price screen, and scarcity 
pricing is a very important factor in the equation. The commission uses a 
model that takes different factors into account (for instance, weighted gas, 
weighted NOX, etc.) to determine a price of electricity when the lights are 
about to go out (Stage 3 alert time). That is the price that FERC uses to 
determine scarcity  prices. Therefore, it can and will change month to month. 

One may wonder how HSbert can reconcile the use of a market price screen and 
yet remain so opposed to price caps. However, it is important to realize 
that, for the most part, FERC is not prohibiting that power generators sell 
power above the price screen. Rather, FERC will simply demand that any 
company selling power above this price report to the commission and justify 
the higher-than-average price. That is an important but subtle difference 
between a price screen and a price cap, which prohibits generators from 
exceeding a certain price. 

As noted, HSbert spoke earlier this week at a conference in Santa Fe entitled 
""Current Issues Challenging the Utility Industry"" sponsored by the Center for 
Public Utilities. HSbert spoke about a variety of topics, including the 
current status of RTO applications and new technologies related to pipelines 
and generation. However, one thing that HSbert said related to the wholesale 
market in California struck me as particularly interesting. HSbert said that 
last fall wholesale power suppliers offered California utilities long-term 
power contracts in the range of $55/MWh. The general consensus among the 
utilities and Gov. Gray Davis was that the price was excessive and that they 
should wait to sign long-term deals until wholesale prices decreased (or 
until the state could negotiate lower prices on behalf of the utilities). 
HSbert's point was that California utilities could have saved approximately 
$5 billion had they signed on for long-term deals at that time. Most of the 
contracts that the California Department of Water Resources is now signing 
with power suppliers are confidential and thus we do not know how the fixed 
prices of the contracts compare to the average $55/MWh that was offered last 
fall. However, most reports indicate that the state of California already has 
spent $4 billion to procure power and is expected to pay $14 billion for 
power over the course of this year.  

Meanwhile, California and other western lawmakers continue to urge the Bush 
administration and FERC to enact temporary price caps in the West. In fact, 
bipartisan lawmakers from California, Oregon and Washington met with Vice 
President Dick Cheney, head of the Bush administration's energy task force, 
to assert that soaring electricity prices in the West could lead the entire 
country into a recession. Cheney responded that the White House opposes any 
price controls on energy as they would discourage new power plants from being 
built.  

At the Santa Fe conference HSbert said that, ""Washington doesn't do temporary 
very well."" What he meant by this statement was that, although lawmakers are 
putting pressure on the federal government to put a temporary price cap into 
place, if one were to be enacted it would most likely remain in place for 
some time. Clearly, HSbert will continue to oppose wholesale price caps in 
the West (unless someone can make the case to him that price restrictions 
will lower demand or increase supply). Yet, at the same time, just this week 
HSbert said that he was ""open"" to a request from New York City Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani to enact wholesale power prices in the Northeast. Giuliani asked 
FERC to impose a temporary $250/MWh cap on wholesale electricity prices to 
ensure that New York City gets through tight summer power supplies without 
large price spikes. How FERC as a whole will rule on the larger issue of 
price caps across the country (and particularly in California) once the new 
commissioners come on board remains to be seen. In any event, FERC (along 
with state regulators) still faces the challenge of finding some long-term 
solution that will stabilize the market in California and the Pacific 
Northwest.

144,"Alternative SDG&E debt plan to get hearings 
Approval of the governor's plan for paying the $747 million debt SDG&E says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday, as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San Diego regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about $185 million more than the governor's proposal. 
The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San Diego Gas & Electric. 
At stake is how much SDG&E contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt, which accumulated in a so-called balancing account when SDG&E paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis. 
Despite the plan for hearings, Lynch told KPBS-FM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial $747 million debt by November. 
The governor and SDG&E announced their plan in June, saying it required the utility to contribute $319 million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates. 
Consumer groups, led by the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, say the governor's plan does not go far enough, particularly because SDG&E earned an estimated $400 million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis. 
Under the governor's plan, those profits are awarded to the company's shareholders, though SDG&E would use $219 million from the profits as part of its $319 million contribution toward the debt. 
Under the consumer groups' plan, SDG&E would be allowed to keep some of the profits, but it would contribute $72 million more than it would under the governor's plan. The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions. 
In a formal decision earlier this year, the California utilities commission said SDG&E's profits do belong to customers. SDG&E has sued to overturn the decision in court, but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commission's resolution of the plan to pay the debt. 
Michael Shames, executive director of UCAN, said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynch's call for hearings on the consumer plan. 
""There is $400 million at stake here,"" Shames said. 
SDG&E said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings, nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt. 
A spokesman for the utility, however, repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUC's process of considering the governor's plan. 
Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than $40 billion in long-term electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis. 
Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be ""just and reasonable."" 
The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed. The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets, she said. 
""If you have to pay three to four times more for energy, you don't have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family,"" Lynch said. 
She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of $12.5 billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs. Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds, which would separate them Sfrom the long-term power contracts.",Loretta Lynch Michael Shames Lynch Sfrom,$747 million about $185 million $319 million an estimated $400 million $219 million $72 million $400 million more than $40 billion $12.5 billion,SDG&E the state utilities commission the California Public Utilities Commission San Diego Gas & Electric Lynch KPBS-FM Utility Consumers' Action Network the utilities commission's UCAN PUC the utilities commission

Edison pact could point way for PG&E 
The multibillion-dollar settlement between Southern California Edison and California regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state. 
It might form rough outlines for a deal that could pull Pacific Gas and Electric Co. out of bankruptcy without removing its assets from state regulation. 
The pact between Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission also might presage a nimbler PUC, one likelier to strike closed-door deals without its typical months of testimony, briefs and hearings. 
Along with its statewide impacts, which may not fully unfold for years, the settlement with the state's second-largest utility also raises uncertainties for its customers, who will pay billions to retire its debts. 
One week after a federal judge approved the $6.35 billion pact to restore Edison to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control, it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers. 
From the start, the Edison rescue plan was a stealth settlement. 
It was negotiated in secret, approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward, even some PUC analysts were still debating just how much money was involved. 
""It's definitely ambiguously worded,"" said Steve Linsey, a supervisor in the PUC's semi-independent Office of Ratepayer Advocates. On his first review of the deal, he thought about $1.7 billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates. But that figure will be at least $3.3 billion and probably higher, according to Edison and those who negotiated the deal for the PUC. 
""There seems to be a lot of off-the-books interpretation in a direction that is unfavorable to ratepayers,"" Linsey said. 
The PUC settlement emerged after the Senate and Assembly deadlocked over how much money should flow to Edison and what other benefits should be included for the company and some of its customers. 
In addition, the PUC gave Edison permission to use small and large customers' rates to collect much of the money to pay off back debts, bypassing legislative bargaining to shield residential consumers. 
And the PUC settlement took a much broader view of Edison's finances, sweeping in old debts and cash on hand, and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off $6.35 billion in debts. 
About three-fourths of that amount -- $4.9 billion -- appears to come from the utility's customers. 
Edison's investors will pick up $1.5 billion -- $1.2 billion through eliminating shareholder dividends for three years, and $300 million as a company contribution. 
The clearest-cut customer contribution flows into a $3.3 billion pot to be filled by future electric bills, probably through the end of 2003. But that's not their only contribution. 
Another $1.6 billion would come from Edison's cash on hand, which includes money already collected from rates and loans that will eventually be repaid by customers. 
""In the end, you're right, the vast sum of money here comes from ratepayers,"" said Brian Bennett, Edison vice president of external affairs. 
But if Edison had won its suit, Bennett said, it would have been entitled to the full $6.35 billion, without its shareholders taking any hit at all. 
No one can know who would have won the Edison suit. Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments. So why did the PUC, after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail, chose to settle? 
Partly, the commission was getting gloomy forecasts from the law firm it had hired, said PUC commissioner Richard Bilas. But he and others said there was another, looming fear. 
The PG&E bankruptcy reorganization plan, filed Sept. 20, called for shifting utility assets, including the company's hydroelectric plants, nuclear plant, and gas storage and pipeline network, to a firm free from state regulation. 
""People's calculus was shaken up by what PG&E did,"" said Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. ""It was just in the ether that 'oh God, there's something really ugly out there. We don't think they can get away with it, but we're not entirely sure.'"" 
The reorganization plan would leave a new PG&E company free to set its own rates for power that its plants produce. 
That prospect horrifies regulators and lawmakers who have watched unregulated generators set market prices so high they crippled PG&E and Edison. 
They plan to fight PG&E's efforts, and one of their key tools could be showing the judge that the PUC has been able to salvage Edison while keeping it regulated. 
""They could say, 'judge, you don't have to do this bad deal that PG&E wants. We can work it out,'"" said Randy Chinn, an adviser to state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey. 
For its part, PG&E maintains that the PUC should have helped it out last fall with something similar to the Edison deal. But now, the utility said, it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan. 
PUC chief counsel Gary Cohen predicts that if the utility's efforts are rejected by the bankruptcy judge, PG&E will have to begin consultations with regulators for some sort of solution. 
""I think it would be smarter to be talking now,"" he said. 
A PG&E rescue wouldn't follow the Edison settlement exactly because PG&E's debts and costs are higher, Cohen said, but the PUC's goal would be the same goal it held for Edison: a healthy, regulated utility. 
Consumer groups have blasted the settlement for funneling money to Edison after the utility was allowed to essentially pad its bills during the late 1990s to position itself for deregulation. A PUC majority took a similar stance for more than a year -- until the Edison settlement. 
""We finally got to the point where we said look, we've seen the alternatives, and the alternatives are something like what PG&E is trying to do, or having the state take over the business of buying power,"" Cohen said. 
Most people at the commission, he said, concluded that a regulated utility looks much more appealing than unregulated power plants or the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for cash-strapped utilities since January. 
Cohen, who orchestrated the Edison settlement negotiations, said they had to be kept quiet for fear that a leak could trigger a bankruptcy filing. Bilas said if it had leaked, so many people would have tried to stop the deal that it likely would have been torpedoed. 
At a closed session before approving it, he said, every commissioner worried aloud that they were sidestepping their own frequent calls for due process, full information and proper hearings. 
It is far too early to say whether more closed door deals will follow. Bilas, Florio and others predict the current PUC has little taste for them. But the five-member commission continues to evolve each time a term expires and the governor appoints a new commissioner. 
""It scares the hell out of me what a really pro-utility commission would do with this,"" said Florio, the consumer advocate. ""This could be the beginning of something really ugly."" 
In addition, if utilities see federal suits as way to slice through time-consuming PUC procedures, a flurry of suits could follow, said Linsey of the Ratepayer Advocates' Office.","Jeff

Spring Football Notes . .

QB Chris Simms completed 11 of 15 passes for 174 yards and a touchdown to
highlight UT's annual Orange-White game before a crowd school officials
estimated at 31,000

The only touchdown the first-team defense gave up was a 53-yard Simms pass =

WR Roy Williams, who had a step on CB Quentin Jammer.
Simms also led the offense to a field goal.
QB Major Applewhite, operating behind an offensive line patched with
walk-ons, led the second team to one touchdown against the second-team
defense, on a fade route to WR Sloan Thomas in the end zone.
My vote for most improved offensive player this spring is split three ways

Maroon-Hued Journalists Abound

I should have commented on this earlier, but better late than never.
Kevin Sherrington of the Dallas News wrote a love-in column about Texas A&M
coach R. C. Slocum right after national signing day, and both Slocum and
Sherrington used the opportunity to throw a few rocks at Texas coach Mack
Brown and the Longhorns
I'm going to quote a couple of excerpts from the column, with my comments
about them. Here's the first one:
""Such is R.C. Slocum's life these days. Never had a losing season at Texas
A&M. Won more games than any coach in school history. Run a clean program h=
is
dozen years as head coach.""
Clean program? No question it's cleaner than it used to be, but Sherrington
must have a really short memory. Remember those no-show jobs?
Then Sherrington and Slocum got into recruiting, and both took some shots a=
t
Brown and UT. Here's what they said in the column:
""Of course, rankings come with caveats, too, Slocum reminded. After four
years of enrolling the country's top recruiting classes, he asked, 'shouldn=
't
a school have the most talented team in the country? Shouldn't expectations
go way up?' ""
"" 'Wouldn't that be accurate?' Slocum asked.""
""In other words, you're up, Mr. Brown.""
First of all, Brown hasn't had ""four years of enrolling the country's top
recruiting classes."" He's had three of them, and the third class hasn't eve=
n
enrolled yet. The other two were freshmen and sophomores last year and they
are the heart and soul of the team.
Brown's first signees at Texas weren't in the class of the others, which
certainly were highly ranked classes.
His first great class will be starting its third year this season and it is
ready to boost the Longhorns back into national prominence.
The Aggies, on the other hand, went 11-3 in 1998, 8-4 in 1999 and 7-4 in
2000. Sounds like a downward spiral to me. I wonder if Aggies' expectations
are ""way up?""
Second, the last time I looked, Texas and Texas A&M had played three times
since Brown arrived to find Slocum firmly entrenched at A&M with his progra=
m
already well established.
Enheriting a 4-7 team, Brown has produced three consecutive nine-win season=
s
and, while I know it sounds far-fetched after reading the remarks of
Sherrington and Slocum, he has a 2-1 edge over Slocum and his Aggies.
The lone Aggie victory over Brown was in 1999 at A&M by a razor-thin 20-16
margin when UT QB Major Applewhite, the Big 12 Co-Offensive Player of the
Year, was too sick to play.
I know you play with what you have and I am not saying that Aggie victory
shouldn't count, but what I am saying is that any outsider reading the colu=
mn
would think the Aggies must be hammering us every year.
While I'm on the subject of biased reporting, I thought it was interesting
that the Houston Chronicle published a three-column bylined story on the
Texas A&M spring game, which drew 6,000 fans. The paper did not staff the U=
T
spring game and did not run one line on an event that was attended by 31,00=
0
fans.
The UT Sports Information Department distributed a lengthy story on the
spring game and many papers used all or part of it, but the Chronicle simpl=
y
ignored the entire event.
The Chronicle has one sports columnist, devout Aggie John Lopez, who doesn'=
t
even try to get his facts straight when writing, about Texas.
Remember his column on how UT basketball guard Darren Kelly wanted to go to
A&M, but didn't have the grades.
Kelly was a full qualifier out of high school and, in fact, started his
college career at a Division I school before switching to a JC.
When he missed a semester at Texas for academic problems, it was because ma=
ny
of his hours at the small JC he attended did not transfer and he was short =
on
hours toward his degree. It wan't because he was failing any courses.
But Lopez was more interested in making excuses for the dismal Aggie
basketball team than he was in getting the facts straight.
If you get as irritated as I do with columnists who continue to glorify the
Aggies and ignore or put down the Longhorns, let the sports editors and/or
their bosses know about it.

An Early Look at the Schedule

Trying to predict football games in April that are several months away is a
dangerous business, so I'm going to just look at the schedule and talk abou=
t
the likely odds on all the games.
The Longhorns probably will be at least 15-point favorites over five of the=
ir
foes. They are the home games against New Mexico State and Kansas and the
road games against Houston, Oklahoma State and Baylor.
Texas also will be favored, probably by  at least 10 points, in the home g
ames against North Carolina and Texas Tech and the game at Missouri.
That leaves the Oct. 6 date in Dallas against defending national champion
Oklahoma, the Oct. 20 home game against Colorado and the Nov. 23 visit to A=
&M
as the ones that would appear to be the most dangerous.
I think Colorado will be a dangerous team if RB Marcus Houston stays health=
y,
and A&M is always dangerous in College Station.
But there is no question that the Sooners are the most dangerous looking fo=
e
on the schedule.
I won't predict Texas will win every game, but I will predict if the
Longhorns average 100 yards rushing against OU, Colorado and A&M, we'll all
be smiling heading into the post season.

Conradt Gives Up AD Title

Jody Conradt, UT women's basketball coach since 1976 and women's athletic
director since 1992, is going back to coaching full time and giving up the =
AD
post
""I have appreciated the opportunity to serve the university, but my heart a=
nd
my passion are about coaching women's athletics,"" she said.
Conradt, 59, said she thinks her basketball program is making ""significant
progress"" toward returning to the national spotlight and said she wants to
devote full time to that job.
Chris Plonsky, 43, a senior associate athletic director in the men's
department, will serve as women's athletic director on an interim basis and
will get a new title: senior associate athletic director for men's and
women's athletics.
Patricia Ohlendorf, UT vice president for institutional relations and legal
affairs, oversees both athletic departments. She said she will chair a smal=
l
committee that will study the men's and women's athletic departments to
determine their future course.
The study probably will take about two  months to complete, and all signs
point to a recommendation to combine the two departments.
Only five Division I universities have separate athletic departments for me=
n
and women. The others are Tennessee, Arkansas, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
In recent years, the two departments have combined to operate together in
several areas at Texas, such as sports medicine, strength and conditioning,
fund-raising and development, marketing, ticket operations and media
relations.
Sources close to the situation at UT say combining the two departments and
having one director to oversee both would save more than $1 million a year.
The sources also say UT President Larry Faulkner, who will make the ultimat=
e
call, favors combining the two departments.
In this day of increasing expenses and tight budgets, it would make a lot o=
f
sense to join the other 11 schools in the Big 12 and the vast majority of t=
he
other Division I schools in combining the two departments under one athleti=
c
director.
It would eliminate a lot of duplication and save a lot of money.

Jamboree on TV in Austin

Umpire Boycott Silly

The three Austin-area umpires who are boycotting non-conference baseball
games at Texas' Disch-Falk Field because of what they term insulting person=
al
attacks by Longhorns assistant coaches are being silly.
David Wiley, Tim Henderson and Wade Ford say they won't call Texas'
non-conference games the rest of the season because they are unhappy with t=
he
way they have been treated by UT assistants Frank Anderson and Tommy Harmon=
.
""Tim, Wade and I have just decided it might be better for all parties
involved if we worked elsewhere this year because the professional climate
has deteriorated all year, such that we felt it would be better for us to
extract ourselves from that situation,"" Wiley said.
Henderson and Wade were assigned before the season to work some Big 12 game=
s
at Disch-Falk and said they will honor that commitment.
The reason the boycott is silly is that umpires have the ultimate weapon in
disputes with coaches. They can eject them, and that would be a far more
reasonable approach than what Wiley, Henderson and Ford have chosen to do.
A few ejections will make any coach see the light, even if he is in the
right, because umpires have dictatorial power over coaches.
It's also strange that Wiley is talking about it to reporters. The Big 12 h=
as
a strict gag rule on all Big 12 coaches, and Wiley knows he can say anythin=
g
he wants to without fear of contradiction from the other parties involved.

163,"DJ REPEAT:Ercot Sees 56,373 MW Summer Peak,2% Below '00 Peak

DJ Ercot: New Units Will Boost Supply to 65,064 MW

DJ Ercot: 21% Summer Reserve If Normal Weather

DJ Ercot Summer -2: New 345-Kv Line To Relieve Congestion


By Eileen O'Grady
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--After several tight summers, new generation and a new
transmission line in Texas should push the power region's summer reserve
above
20%, according to a projections from the Electric Reliability Council of
Texas.

According to a summer assessment study compiled by Ercot, utilities and
power
suppliers forecast a peak load demand of 56,373 megawatts this summer, 2% MW
under the record-shattering 2000 peak of 57,606 MW.

The lower peak forecast assumes a return to normal summer temperatures.
Last
summer, Texas saw record heat amid a drought that lasted 84 days in parts of
the
state. That increased power demand to record levels.

Ercot's projected peak of 54,817 MW for summer 2000 wound up being 5%
under
the actual peak seen Aug. 31.

Spot power prices jumped above $100 per megawatt-hour in four brief spikes
last summer, twice in May and again in July and August.

While drought conditions have eased since last summer, the report warns
that
Ercot's peak could jump to 58,550 MW if forecasts provided by investor-owned
utilities haven't included a possible shift in demand from customers
participating in a retail pilot project that begins June 1.

Even so, more than 3,350 MW of new generation is expected to be online
compared with last summer, pushing Ercot's net capacity resources to 65,064
MW,
according to the report.

The Ercot assessment says the new generation should keep the region's
reserve
margin above 20% in August when demand is expected to peak.

The Ercot report, however, includes 1,730 MW of ""border"" generation that
can
be sold into Ercot or into the Southwest Power Pool.

A separate report from the Texas Public Utility Commission staff pointed
out
several additional merchant generating plants slated to come online this
summer
in Ercot.

The PUC staff report paints a more bullish forecast for demand. The PUC
said
coincident peak demand for power in Ercot grew at a compound rate of 4.3%
from
1995 to 2000.

Total annual energy consumption in Ercot grew by nearly 7.5% from 1999 to
2000, according to the PUC.

The 21% reserve margin in August is twice the amount seen last summer. It
includes 2,870 MW of interruptible demand, slightly below last summer's
3,000 MW
of available load that could be curtailed.

Ercot transmission constraints are expected to be reduced dramatically
this
summer as an additional 345-kilovolt line running from Limestone power
station
to the Watermill switchyard is expected to be in service this month,
alleviating
the south-to-north congestion seen in the last two summers.

Additional lines are in the planning stages to relieve the west-to-east
flow
from Morgan Creek.

On June 1, Ercot will become a single control area as the region moves
toward
full retail competition beginning Jan. 1.

The current interregional transfer limit is 785 MW across the state's two
direct-current ties with SPP although there is expected to be some
limitation
this summer due to a breaker problem near the east DC tie.

Because Ercot lacks synchronous interconnection with the rest of the U.S.
power grid, the region has limited ability to import electricity in times of
high demand.

Ercot is a group of interconnected utilities that serves about 85% of the
power load in the state.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

																												financial  strength and keep up with the 3%annual growth in Wisconsin's  
electricity demand. The plan, pending regulatory approval, aims to  build at 
least one 500 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired unit and  at least two 600 
MW coal-fired units over the next decade, for a  total of 1,700 MW. More 
units may be built after 2010, eventually  raising new generation capacity in 
the state to around 3,000 MW.  Wisconsin Public Service also hopes to add to 
the state's power grid  by building the Arrowhead-Weston line, a 250-mile 345 
kilovolt  transmission line from Minnesota to central Wisconsin. The line  
would directly link Wisconsin to power supplies in Canada and North  Dakota, 
easing transmission bottlenecks to the west and south.  Wisconsin imports up 
to 20% of its power.

is so strong that the agency must  purchase power on the open market to 
augment its supply. To recover  the cost of these purchases, it proposes to 
tack a 15% charge onto  wholesale rates effective next October. Even with an 
additional  charge, BPA's wholesale rates are still well below wholesale 
market  prices currently forecast for the next five years on the West Coast.  
BPA signed new wholesale contracts last week with more than 130  Northwest 
utilities and industries for 10-years. Those agreements  pushed its total 
firm energy load? up to 11,000 MW. That is  almost 3000 MW more than the

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2 during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1262&> , WR NYG - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=133240&>, RB BUF - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

David Patten <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 12/21/01
Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless your team is very thin at wide receiver. 

Joey Galloway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't recommended. 

Troy Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs.

Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best during your playoffs.

Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your playoffs.

Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs.

225,"There are two fields of gas that I am having difficulty with in the Unify 
System.

1. Cage Ranch - Since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this 
gas on King Ranch, it is my understanding  HPL is selling the liquids and 
King Ranch is re-delivering to stratton.  It is also my understanding that 
there is a .05 cent fee
 to deliver this gas.  We need a method to accomodate the volume flow on HPL 
at meter 415 and 9643.  This gas 
 will not be reflected on Trans. Usage ticket #123395 and #95394 since it is 
not being nominated from a   processing agreement.  We either, need to input 
a point nom (on HPL or KRGP) at these meters to match the nom at meter  9610, 
or a deal for Purchase and Sale (if King Ranch is taking title to the gas) 
needs to be input into Sitara at these meters  with the  appropriate rate.  I 
have currently input a point nom on KRGP to accomodate this flow, so we can  
divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made.

2. Forest Oil -   There is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow 
from the meter (6396) into King Ranch.  It is my
 understanding that this agreement was originally setup until Texaco had 
their own processing agreement.  I need   confirmation that the gas from this 
meter should be nominated on contract # (96006681) and that this agreement 
should  have been reassigned to HPLC. (It is currently still under HPLR).  

 If this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement, then once 
again we need to accomodate the flow volume  on the HPL pipe with either a 
point nom or a Sitara Deal at meters 415 and 9643.",Cage Ranch KRGP,a .05 cent 123395 95394,"the Unify

it is 012 it will now be 0012. Easy.  RC #'s are now called Cost Centers and 
they are changing completely.  Please write these down somewhere you will 
need them just like you need to know your RC.

I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself 
to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll 
in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka 
Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of 
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the 
Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my 
observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of 
data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to 
get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with 
this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this 
month as the ""bar is being raised"" by the management of Energy Operations for 
data quality and timeliness.

The attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial 
teams.  Please select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the 
requested driver for the month of May. Please fill out the attached activity 
driver survey with May numbers for your RC and return to Shari Mao by end of 
day Friday, June 2.

Please note the following updates:
For Nat Gas, Sally Beck is interested in physical (as denoted as PH in the 
survey) vs. financial (as denoted as FI in the survey) numbers, please 
provide statistics accordingly

TXU Sued By 23 Texas Cities Over Franchise Fees
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The City of Denton, Texas, has filed a lawsuit against TXU Electric & Gas,
claiming that the utility intentionally underpaid Denton its franchise
fees by not accurately reporting its gross revenues, on which franchise
fees are based. To date, 23 cities have signed resolutions to join Denton
in the lawsuit and more are expected. An initial audit by Denton claims
that the amount that TXU owes could potentially exceed $240 million.

ANALYSIS: Over this last year, several utilities in Texas have come under
fire for allegedly not paying the full amount of franchise fees for which
various cities claim they are obligated. This suit against TXU is just
the latest, but it follows a judgment against Reliant Energy earlier this
spring and a pending suit against CPL (a subsidiary of AEP/CSW).

Franchise fees are essentially rental payments that a city has the right
to charge a utility for use of the city's public streets and grounds for
the placement of pipelines, poles and utility cables. Texas state law allow=
s
cities to charge utilities 2 percent of their gross revenues for the right
to franchises within a city's limits. Some utilities such as Reliant entere=
d
into agreements=01*stretching back to the 1950s=01*that obligate them to pa=
y
4 percent of gross revenues earned in a city in exchange for 50-year=20
franchises.
In any case, the cities are arguing that franchise fees should be based
on gross revenue, not net revenue, that the utilities have earned from
providing service within the city limits.

Herein lies the core of the litigation as, in this case, the City of Denton
is claiming that TXU intentionally reported lower gross revenue, thereby
reducing the amount it was required to pay to Denton and the other cities
involved in the lawsuit. The cities involved in the suit claim they are
entitled to not only unpaid franchise fees from TXU, but punitive damages
as well.

The prognosis may not be very good for TXU, if a similar case against Relia=
nt
Energy is any indication. In May, a Houston jury ruled that Reliant-HL&P
""acted with malice by intentionally underpaying cities for decades for
the exclusive right to sell electricity in those cities."" The state distric=
t
court ordered HL&P to pay $34.2 million to the cities of Pasadena, Galvesto=
n
and Wharton. The award consisted of $30 million in punitive damages, anothe=
r
$3 million because it was determined that HL&P had defrauded the cities,
and $1.2 million in actual damages. That seemed to be just the start of
Reliant's problems, as following that case 47 additional cities, including
Houston, came together and launched a class-action suit against Reliant
HL&P, again claiming that the utility intentionally underpaid franchise
fees for the sole right to provide power in the cities. This lawsuit is
claiming $113 million in damages, the bulk of which ($77 million) is allott=
ed
for the City of Houston.

However, illustrating how polarized this issue is, just last week a state
district judge overturned the $34.2 million ruling for the first three
cities, and reduced the damages down to $1.2 million. In addition, the
same judge overturned the separate ruling that had given the green light
for the 47 cities to proceed with the class-action suit. Both rulings are
still being appealed by the cities in hopes to reinstate the award for
fraud and punitive damages. In addition, the 47 cities involved in the
new lawsuit against Reliant are proceeding=01*just with 47 individual cases
instead of one. Sound confusing? It certainly is, and it will no doubt
amount to one big mess if the cities are not permitted to band together
in one class-action suit.

Here's Reliant's position in the litigation, which is presently supported
by the Texas State District Court. Reliant claims that transactions that
do not generate profits or represent the selling of power in a city=01*such
as reconnection fees, renting pole space to other utilities and sending
electricity to other markets=01*should not be considered part of gross reve=
nue
and, therefore, not subject to franchise fees. Thus, the figure Reliant
reported as gross revenue may indeed be lower than the cities expected
it to be=01*but it is an accurate number, based on Reliant's interpretation=
.

As noted, CPL is also involved in a pending lawsuit with the City of San
Juan, Texas, and a group of about 30 other cities. These cities claim that
CPL underpaid franchise fees and seek damages of up to $300 million plus
attorney's fees. CPL has filed a counterclaim for overpayment of franchise
fees and intends to defend itself against the cities' claims.

How all of this will impact the case against TXU is unclear, but certainly
the momentum is growing against the utilities in Texas. TXU, like Reliant
and CPL, maintains that it has done nothing wrong and that it has paid
in full all of the fees owed to the over 330 Texas cities and towns to
which it provides electric service. Again, the center of the dispute lies
in how to calculate gross revenues. TXU contends that gross revenue include=
s
only the direct proceeds it has received from the sale of electricity and
natural gas. The City of Denton, on the other hand, argues that gross reven=
ue
also should include other income such as taxes and fees collected for bad
checks, which conceivably could result in a much higher figure, especially
when calculated over a 40-year period.

TXU had 1999 operating revenues of approximately $17.1 billion so, like
Reliant, a settlement in the $1.2 million range would not wield much financ=
ial
impact. However, more important to these utilities may be the fact that
this could be just the beginning of a string of similar lawsuits, brought
forward by cities across Texas. Consider the class action suit against
Reliant, to the tune of $113 million. If that suit is allowed to proceed,
we're talking about big money, especially when attorney fees are added
to the equation. In addition, the reputation of these utilities is at stake=
.
The cities initiating the lawsuits are using such terms as ""unlawful busine=
ss
practices"" and claiming that every dollar utilities like TXU and Reliant
have not paid to the cities means a dollar increase in taxes for citizens.
As deregulation continues to unfold, a utility's reputation will be one
of the foundations on which it attracts new customers and retains current
ones.

It's also important to note that under Texas' restructuring law, once=20
competition
begins in the state (January 2002) the formula to determine franchise fees
in the state will switch from a revenue formula to a consumption formula.
In other words, the amount that utilities collected as gross revenue in
1998 will be divided by the amount of total kilowatt hours consumed within
the city limits during the same year, and that will be the amount of the
franchise fee owed by utilities to cities. The franchise fee shall be equal
to the charge per kilowatt hour determined for 1998, multiplied times the
number of kilowatt hours delivered within the city limits. Of course, all
of these pending lawsuits are bringing into question the amount of gross
revenue that was collected during 1998, which might make this formula=20
difficult
to calculate. In any case, I don't see these issues subsiding any time
soon as they are based on a fundamentally different interpretation of how
to define gross revenue. The real winners in these lawsuits may be the
attorneys themselves, as undoubtedly these cases will remain in litigation
for several years.

255,"The FERC has issued an Order Accepting the Letter Agreement between Viking 
and ANR to settle the issue of OFO status at the Marshfield interconnect 
between the two pipes.

The following is a quick synopsis:

Settlement  is effective through March 31, 2001 only.

The following steps will be undertaken in the event ANR is experiencing 
flowing volumes at Marshfield less than 200 Mdth/d and, in ANR's good faith 
reasonable judgment, such shortfall will threaten the operational integrity 
of its pipe in Western Wisconsin.  Also, ANR first has to maximize flowing 
volumes of 86 Mdth/d at NNG-Janesville and 735 Mdth/d at Great Lakes -Crystal 
Falls.

ANR will issue an OFO to the ANR shippers with firm primary receipt pt 
capacity at Viking-Marshfield directing their shippers to schedule their gas 
on ANR at Marshfield.
If any shipper does not comply with the OFO, ANR will notify Viking of the 
shipper, default volume, and upstream Viking shipper holding primary delivery 
pt capacity at Marshfield on Viking who is supposed to be supplying the gas.
Viking will then notify the defaulting shipper on their system that they will 
only accept firm primary delivery pt nominations at Marshfield for the volume 
designated by ANR until ANR notifies Viking that the OFO condition has ended.
If the Viking shipper does not comply by taking their gas to Marshfield as 
requested by Viking, Viking will permit ANR to act as shipper's agent and 
nominate for them.

It was noted that ANR will not be a shipper on Viking or hold title to gas 
transported on Viking.

This letter agreement resolves temporarily ANR's request for 33 Mdth/d of 
capacity on Viking they filed on June 19, 2000 in Docket CP00-391-000.

Additional Notes:

The ANR shippers with firm primary receipt pt capacity at Marshfield are:  
Mich Con, UtiliCorp, Wisonsin Electric, Wisconsin Fuel & Light, and Wisconsin 
Public Service.  

The Viking shippers with firm primary delivery pt capacity at Marshfield 
are:  The same shippers as above as well as Engage Energy.

I don't know exactly what Chris wanted but here's my stab at it and remember

Deal 459233 is the exchange offset to 459214 and should probably be zerod 
out.  459193 is the exchange offset to 459175 and should probably be zerod 
out as well.  

Scott, 459188 and 459231 seem to be the New Power buys needed. I don't know 
which are the New Power sales needed to hook up with transport to capture

460591 is the exchange offset to Oglethorpe deal 460623.  They are totally

What do you mean you are there ""for the  time being""?  Wouldn't your position be maintained when the trading group  is acquired?  I would think that as long as J Arnold has a say you would be  included.  Am I incorrect?  Things in Unemployment Land are pretty  surreal.  When I stop and think about the hours that I put in only to be  laid off...go figure.  However, I try not to dwell in areas where I had no  control.  I have been flooding my resume throughout the Houston-based  energy companies to no avail.  There is no telling when the ""Enron Effect""  will wear off on the capital markets, so I might have to consider a different  industry (know of any good antique shops that need a full time  cashier?)
 
I tried to enjoy the holidays, but I  constantly kept an eye on my inbox and carried my cell phone everywhere just in  case.  As you can imagine, not completely relaxing.  The good news is  that I am going to Florida Sunday to visit a friend, run on the beach, drink  heavily and hopefully play golf.  Have you been able to play?  When  all of this gets resolved, you and I definitely need to hit the links (as long  as you don't mind me wandering through the woods most of the time).

_____________________________________________________________________

June Nasdaq futures closed 26.50 lower at 1808.00 today. Prices hit a
fresh two-week low today, but have been trading sideways for several
weeks. The sideways trading favors the bulls, but they still have
some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is
resistance at the key 2,000 area. First support is seen at the 1,732
area.

June S&P 500 futures closed 0.20 higher at 1252.00. Same story:
Prices have leveled off the past four weeks, after rallying solidly
off the early-April low. This does favor the bulls, but not greatly.
Technically, bulls still need to push prices above the 1285
resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in the stock
market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a slower grind
higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen at 1285.00.
First support is seen at 1206.00.

LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed $0.58 higher at 70.75 today.
Prices rebounded from a technically oversold condition today, and on
news that boxed beef prices had improved. Last week, prices hit a
fresh multi-month low. Still, prices are in an accelerating
two-month-old downtrend on the daily bar chart and bears have
control. Next support, basis June, is seen at $70.25. First
resistance comes in at the $71.00 level.

August feeder cattle closed off 22 cents today at $87.65. The rally
in the corn market today hurt feeders. If recent history continues to
play out in feeders, prices may dip a bit more, but the support area
of 87.40 will cap losses. That is the lower level of the trading band
in place for the past several weeks. If prices break down below the
bottom of the recent trading range, then the door is opened to a
lower trend down to the January low just above the $86.00 level. Next
resistance is seen at $88.00. First support is seen at $87.60 and
then at $87.40.

June lean hogs closed $0.25 higher at $68.80 today. Commercial buying
was seen in the futures pits, reports said. Price action today saw
more consolidation after the strong losses recorded in recent weeks.
But the bears still have the momentum on their side at present. Next
support lies at $67.00. First resistance is located at the 69.50
level.

GRAINS: July corn futures closed 4 1/2 cents higher at $2.01 3/4
today. Another ""mini"" weather scare popped prices today. Two
important things to point out here: One, July corn (now the nearby
contract) did not stay below the key $2.00-per-bushel level very
long. Secondly, notice how even some hot temps forecast for mid-May
popped prices higher. I suspect that with prices this low going into
the growing season, this type of knee-jerk reaction to any changes in
the weather patterns will be the norm. Still, bottom pickers should
beware. Next resistance is now seen at $2.04. Next support is seen at
$2.00.

July soybeans closed 7 1/2 cents higher at $4.43 1/4 today. Like
corn, beans were boosted by a ""mini"" weather scare and ideas that now
there may not be significant corn acres switched to soybeans.
Importantly, the bean market did not fare that badly, technically,
last week, in the face of the sell offs in corn and wheat futures.
Today's big upside push propelled prices to a fresh five-week high
and pushed prices above a stiff resistance area at $4.45. Bears still
have the advantage. It's going to take a ""significant"" weather scare
this spring or summer to force soybean prices solidly higher. First
resistance is now seen at the $4.50 area and then $4.55. First
support is now seen at $4.35.

July soybean meal closed up $3.60 at $159.40 today. Prices today
pushed to a fresh nearly three-month-high. Importantly, prices pushed
above the congestion area on the

daily bar chart that had contained gains for better than a week.
Recent price action is very encouraging to the bulls and is a solid
sign the lows are in place in the meal market. Next resistance comes
in at the $162.00 area. First support is seen at $156.00.

July bean oil closed 7 points higher at 14.73 cents today. Prices
scored another new contract low today of 14.62 cents. Oil is still
technically weaker than beans or meal right now. But I would be
surprised if there is much downside left in oil. Next resistance
comes in at 15.00 cents. Next support is seen at 14.50 cents.

July Chicago wheat gapped higher on the daily bar chart and closed 7
1/4 cents higher at $2.78 1/2 today. Hot and dry weather forecast for
the U.S. Plains states this week combined with a bullish USDA report
last Thursday to send prices sharply higher today. Now, odds have
increased that a double-bottom reversal on the daily bar chart will
be confirmed. The fact that wheat was technically oversold also led
to the stronger upside movement today. Prices last Wednesday touched
the contract low of $2.65. Bears still have the slight edge, but
bulls are gaining confidence rapidly. First resistance lies at the
$2.80 area. Next support is seen at $2.75.

SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 9 points lower at 9.01 cents today.
Prices scored a bearish ""outside day"" down on the daily bar chart
today. We still could see a minor bullish pennant forming in sugar,
but prices would need to bounce right back higher soon. Bulls can
still correctly argue that today's pullback was just consolidation
amid good prices gains seen recently. A three-month high was scored
in July sugar just recently. A six-week-old uptrend line is still in
place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now comes in at 9.15
cents--today's high. First support is seen at 8.80 cents.

July N.Y. coffee closed 3.40 cents lower at 64.25 cents today. Prices
gapped lower on the daily bar chart and let some of the air out of
the bulls' balloon. They had gained momentum lately. Not much
technical damage will occur if prices can rebound, but if good
follow-through selling occurs Tuesday, then odds significantly
increase that prices will test the recent lows. First support comes
in at 62 cents. First resistance is seen at 67.00 cents-- today's
high.

July N.Y. cocoa closed $10 higher today, at $1,024. Prices scored a
corrective ""inside day"" on the daily bar chart today, following
Friday's big sell off. The bears wanted to see follow-through selling
today to confirm a bearish key reversal down on the daily bar chart,
but that did not occur. Bulls and bears are still on a level playing
field. Next resistance comes in at $1,062. First support is now seen
at $1,000.

July cotton closed 153 points higher at 46.70 cents today. Hot and
dry weather in the cotton-growing regions of the U.S. combined with a
technically oversold condition on the market to push prices solidly
higher today. The cotton market will be like the grains. Prices are
so depressed that traders will be extra jumpy when any potentially
adverse weather patterns are forecast. There was good follow-through
buying today from Friday's ""outside day"" up on the daily bar chart,
and a key reversal up was confirmed. This gives the bulls a bit more
confidence. Cotton is still in a bear market and any rebounds may be
selling opportunities for the bears. Let's see what happens this
week. My bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming
process. Next resistance lies at 48.00 cents. First support now is
seen around 45.00 cents. Would-be bottom-pickers should still beware.

July orange juice futures closed 30 points higher today, at 79.20
cents. Prices closed near the session high. Last week, bulls filled
an important downside gap area on the daily bar chart. They have
gained confidence after the recent price action, but will need to see
more upside action this week--pushing prices above 80 cents--to gain
solid momentum. Next resistance is seen at 80.00 cents. Next support
comes in at 77.60 cents--today's low.

July lumber futures closed the limit of $10.00 higher again today, at
$324.80. Prices today again gapped higher and hit a new for-the-move
high. Bulls are really snorting now. Expect more volatility, as is
typical for this market. The next upside objective for the bulls is
now the $330.00 area, and then $335.00. First support is seen at the
$315.00 area. This is a fun market to watch from the sidelines. But
the volatility can be a killer to those who are caught on the wrong
side of the lumber market.

METALS: June COMEX gold closed up $0.40 today, at $268.70. Prices
corrected a bit more today after last Wednesday's strong gains that
pushed prices to a two-month high. This market is in a nice uptrend
since scoring its early-April low. Recent price action is what bulls
needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart. Next
resistance is located at $271.10--the recent high. First support is
seen at $266.00.

July silver closed up $0.02 today, at $4.357 an ounce. Same story:
Silver prices are not that far above the contract low. Prices are
chopping at lower levels, and this suggests a ""basing"" action that
many markets need to change the trend from down, to sideways, to
eventually up. Next support is seen at $4.30. First resistance is
seen at $4.425. Bears have the advantage.

July N.Y. copper closed 85 points lower today, at 75.50 cents. A
bearish U.S. economic report today pulled copper prices down to a new
contract low. The stock market and the U.S. economy will have to be
healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper.
Next resistance is seen at 77.00 cents. Next support is seen at 75.00
cents.

ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.06 higher at $29.13 today. Bulls and
bears are still at a stand-off, but bulls will gain the edge on a
move above $29.50. Expect more choppy trading. Next support is seen
at 28.00. Next resistance lies at $29.50.

July heating oil closed 86 points lower today, at .7566. Bulls still
have the slight edge. Look for more choppy trading in the near
future. Next support is seen at 74.00 cents. Next resistance is seen
at 78.00 cents.

July unleaded gasoline closed 302 points lower at .9428 today. After
prices scored a new contract high last week, they have sold off
dramatically. The increase in volatility at higher price levels
suggests a topping process in the market. Bulls have lost their edge.
Next support is seen at $.9200. First resistance is seen at $.9600.

July natural gas closed 11.5 cents higher at $4.465 today. After,
prices hit a fresh five-and-one-half-month low last Wednesday, we've
seen corrective consolidation. Bears still have the edge. Next
support is seen at $4.20 and first resistance is at $4.60.

STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 20
points lower at .8740 today. Prices pushed to another fresh four-week
low today. Bears have the edge. My bias is still that there is not
much downside left in the Euro, but the markets are always right, so
we'll see. Next support is now seen at .8700. Next resistance is seen
at .8850.

The June Japanese yen closed 47 points lower at .8143 today. Bears
are in control. Bulls are hoping for some ""basing"" activity at lower
levels, and that may be occurring, although it's too early to tell.
Next support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is seen at
the .8326 level.

The June Swiss franc closed 10 points lower at .5713. Bears are in
command. Prices pushed to a fresh 5.5-month low today, and took out
the mid-April low of .5702. If we see follow-through selling to push
prices significantly below today's low, that a bearish signal and
portends significantly more downside. A 4.5-month-old downtrend line
is in place on the daily bar chart, and it has accelerated recently.
Next support is seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes in at
the .5800 level.

The June Australian dollar futures closed 22 points lower at .5193
today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month high last Thursday and the
bulls have the advantage as a six- week-old uptrend line is in place
on the daily bar chart. First resistance is now seen at .5300. First
support is now seen at .5150.

The June Canadian dollar closed 4 points lower today, at .6444. Bulls
are losing momentum as prices correct from the push to the May high.
They still have the slight edge, on a short-term basis, but they will
lose it if they can't turn prices at least sideways this week. This
currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there
is much more downside. Next resistance is seen at the .6500 level.
First support is seen at the .6400 level.

The June British pound closed 4 points lower at 1.4182. Trading
continues choppy at lower levels. As prices approach the lower
portion of the recent trading range, strong support should kick in
and provide for a bounce. But if prices fall below the early April
low of 1.4112, then the door is open to much steeper losses. This
currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not
think there is much more downside in the sterling. One could still
argue that price action the past few weeks has been a ""basing"" before
prices eventually turn north. A move below 1.4100 would be considered
a bearish downside breakout. Next support is now seen at the 1.4112
level. Next resistance comes in at the 1.4270 level.

The June U.S. dollar index closed 24 points higher at 117.22 today.
Prices also pushed to a fresh four-week high again today. Next
resistance lies at the 117.70 level. First support is seen at the
115.50 area. My bias is still that there is not much upside left in
the dollar index. But this week technical odds have increased that a
new high will be scored. We'll see. Markets are never wrong--
analysts are.

June U.S. T-bonds closed 14/32 higher today at 99 20/32. Prices
scored a corrective ""inside day"" today after Friday's price crash to
a six-month low. All eyes are on this week's FOMC meeting, at which a
decision will be made on whether or not to cut interest rates.
Trading will likely be subdued up to the time of the announcement,
which is set to occur tomorrow afternoon. Short-term indicators show
the market is still overdone on the downside, but nobody should stand
in front of a steaming locomotive. Longer-term charts do show good
support at the 99 even area. First resistance is now seen at 100
even-- or ""par.""

The June U.S. T-note closed up 12.0 (32nds) today at 103.11.0. Prices
scored a corrective ""inside day"" after crashing to a five-month low
Friday. Bears have the edge now, as severe technical damage has been
inflicted this week. First support is seen at the 102.29.0 level.
First resistance is seen at 103.16.0 area.

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes closed lower on Wednesday due to profit taking as they
extended Tuesday?s losses. The NASDAQ closed lower for the second day
in a row however, a short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered
some of today's losses leaving the door open for sideways trading on
Friday. If this week?s decline continues, trendline support crossing
near 1816.25 is a possible target later this month. Closes below this
fall?s uptrend line would confirm that this fall?s rally has come to
an end. The December S&P 500 index also closed lower on Wednesday as
it extended profit taking that began on Tuesday. December closed just
below the 50% retracement level of this summer?s decline crossing at
1137.45 today. Closes below last Friday?s low at 1130.50 could lead
to a test of this fall?s uptrend line crossing near 1110.50 later
this year. Momentum indicators are overbought warning investors that
additional long-liquidation is possible into the end of November.

The Dow closed lower on Wednesday due to profit taking ahead of the
Thanksgiving Day holiday. Ideas that this fall?s rebound might have
been too much too fast is causing investors to look hard at their
portfolio?s as they might want to lock in profits ahead of the
upcoming Christmas season. This morning?s consumer confidence report
showed improvement for the second month in a row, which had little
effect on investors today. If today?s setback continues, broken fib
resistance crossing at 9706.20 is a possible target later this month. 

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

December T-bonds renewed its decline off November?s high and broke
out below the 75% retracement level of the Sept./Oct. rally crossing
at 104-29. Today?s close into new lows for the week sets the stage
for a likely test of September?s low crossing at 102-17 later this
month. A short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of
today?s losses leaving the door open for sideways trading on Friday.
Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that additional weakness
is possible into the end of November. 

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index closed higher on Wednesday as it spiked above last
week?s high before profit taking tempered some of today?s gains.
Strength in energies, grains, fiber and some foods underpinned
today?s rally. If this fall?s rebound continues, trendline resistance
crossing near 191.87 is the CRB?s next target. Closes above this
resistance level are needed to confirm a major bottom and trend
change has taken place. 

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed slightly lower on Wednesday in light
pre-holiday trading as they consolidated some of this week?s short
covering gains. Traders continue to mull over comments from OPEC and
non-OPEC nations for a clue on whether or not they will reach an
agreement to cut production.

January crude oil closed slightly lower as it posted a quiet inside
day on Wednesday to consolidate recent gains. If this week?s rebound
continues, fib resistance crossing at 20.02 is Jan.?s next target.
Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to
higher prices are possible into early-December.

December heating oil posted an inside day with a lower close on
Wednesday as it consolidated some of its recent gains. However,
momentum indicators are turning bullish signaling that Monday?s low
marked a short-term bottom. If this week?s rebound continues, fib
resistance crossing at 58.36 is December?s next target. 

December unleaded gas closed slightly lower on Wednesday in choppy
trading. If this week?s rebound continues, fib resistance crossing at
55.55 is December?s next target. Momentum indicators have turned
bullish increasing the odds that a short-term top has likely been
posted. 

December Henry Hub natural gas closed lower on Wednesday following
the release of this week?s AGA inventory report. The report showed a
build of 15 bcf this past week, which was termed bearish. However,
short-term momentum indicators are turning bullish hinting that a
double bottom has likely been posted. 

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The December Dollar erased Tuesday?s loss and closed into new highs
thereby confirming the recent breakout above trading range
resistance. December is poised to test the 62% retracement level of
this summer's decline crossing at 117.79 in the near future. Momentum
indicators are bullish but becoming overbought but have not confirmed
a top is in place. 

The December Swiss Franc closed lower on Wednesday due to light
profit taking as it consolidated some of Tuesday?s gains. However,
closes above trendline resistance crossing near .6136 are needed to
confirm a bottom. Momentum indicators are turning neutral to bullish
hinting that sideways to higher prices are possible into
early-December.

The December Canadian Dollar extended Tuesday?s decline and is poised
to retest this month?s low at .6230 in the near future. If the
decline resumes, .6200 is a potential target later this year. A
number of momentum indicators are turning bearish with today?s
decline signaling that additional weakness is possible near-term. 

The December Japanese Yen posted a downside reversal on Wednesday
thereby ending Tuesday?s short covering bounce. If the decline
resumes, July?s low crossing at .8060 is a potential target later
this year. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices are possible near-term.

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

December gold closed slightly lower on Wednesday ended above August?s
reaction low crossing at 272.60. Closes below this key support level
would open the door for a possible test of this summer?s crossing at
268.40 later this year. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling
that additional weakness is possible into the end of November. 

December silver posted a new contract low on Wednesday as it broke
out below key support crossing at 4.055 cents. The door is open for a
test of weekly support crossing at 3.90 later this year. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are
possible near-term. 

December copper posted a key reversal up on Wednesday. However,
today?s mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading
when the market reopens after Thanksgiving. Closes above 69.60 or
below 66.70 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. 

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

March corn closed steady on Wednesday as it consolidates below the
bottom of October?s gap crossing at 2.21 1/2. Closes above this
resistance level are needed to extend March?s rebound off this
month?s low and set the stage for a possible test of this summer?s
downtrend line crossing near 2.25. Closes above this downtrend line
are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place.
Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher
prices are possible into the end of November. 

March wheat closed fractionally higher on Wednesday as early strength
due to short covering faded ahead of the close. Today?s low-range
close leaves the door open for sideways to lower prices on Friday.
Until export demand improves, upside potential appears limited into
the end of the year. Stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish
signaling that a test of October?s high at 3.03 is still possible by
the end of the year. 

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

January soybeans posted an inside day with a higher close on
Wednesday due to short covering as it consolidated some of Tuesday?s
loss. Friday?s export sales report holds the key as to how January
will close out the week. Thin holiday trading volume could lead to
exaggerated moves in Friday?s shortened session. Closes above this
week?s high at 4.54 3/4 or below this fall?s shallow uptrend line,
which crosses near 4.42 1/2 are needed to clear up near-term
direction in the market. Momentum indicators are overbought and
turned bearish while weekly momentum indicators suggest that
additional short covering gains are possible into the end of the
year. 

January soybean meal closed higher on Wednesday due to short covering
following Tuesday?s above mid-range close. January finished the day
near mid-range leaving the door open for sideways trading on Friday.
Momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that sideways to
lower prices are likely into early-December. January remains locked
in a sideways pattern, as closes above 162 or below 154.40 are needed
to confirm a trading range breakout and point the direction of the
next trending move. 

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

February hogs closed lower on Wednesday following Tuesday?s bearish
monthly cold storage report. However, a short covering bounce ahead
of the close tempered some of today?s losses leaving the door open
for sideways trading on Friday. Momentum indicators are turning
neutral to bearish hinting that sideways to lower prices are possible
into early- December.

February cattle closed steady on Wednesday and remain poised to test
this fall?s downtrend line crossing near 70.30. Closes above this
resistance level are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has
taken place. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that
sideways to higher prices are possible into early-December. 

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

March coffee closed higher on Wednesday in choppy trading as it
extended Tuesday?s short covering bounce. Closes above 53.00 or below
this fall?s uptrend line crossing near 48.60 are needed to clear up
near-term direction in the market. Short-term momentum indicators
remain bearish warning bullish traders to use caution, as the market
remains vulnerable to additional weakness near-term.

March cocoa closed lower on Wednesday as it continues to consolidate
some of this month?s impressive gains. This week?s setback appears to
be nothing more than a retest of broken resistance crossing at 1257.
Closes above 1297 would confirm this week?s breakout and open the
door for a possible test of the March 1999 reaction high crossing at
1341 later this year. The daily ADX is bullish signaling that
sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of November. 

March sugar posted a key reversal up on Wednesday but fell just short
of testing the 50% retracement level of the June/October decline
crossing at 755. Additional strength is needed to confirm today?s
bullish reversal pattern. If this fall?s rally continues, September?s
reaction high crossing at 780 is a potential target later this year.
The daily ADX has entered a bullish trend mode signaling that
sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year.

March cotton closed slightly higher on Wednesday due to improving
world cotton prices. March needs to close above 37.40 or below 35.00
to clear up near-term direction in the market. If this fall?s
short-covering rally resumes, the 50% retracement level of the
July/October decline crossing at 37.88 is March?s next target.
Momentum indicators are bullish but overbought warning bullish
traders to use caution.

to do his best to convince Enerdata, as we would not move on this point.  
(ii)  Certain of the criteria for inclusion - I told him we could not agree 
to any criteria that indirectly or directly restricted the form of products 
we transact on EOL, the times that EOL is available for trading, or which 
provide NGX the discretion to exclude our data once the lawsuit is released.  
He is going to speak to his clients and get back to me over the next couple

Constellation Energy Pursues ""Pure Play"" Strategy

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Christian H. Poindexter, chairman and CEO of Baltimore-based Constellation=
=20
Energy Group (NYSE: CEG), announced that it will create two ""pure play""=20
energy companies mid-to-late this year to focus exclusively on the North=20
American wholesale market, and regional retail energy services in Maryland=
=20
and the surrounding region. Both entities will become publicly traded=20
companies before the end of the year. Constellation Energy Group is a holdi=
ng=20
company that includes a group of competitive energy businesses focused most=
ly=20
on power marketing and merchant generation in North America, plus Baltimore=
=20
Gas & Electric (BGE), a regulated energy company in Central Maryland. In=20
2000, Constellation reported combined revenues of $3.9 billion and total=20
assets of $12.4 billion.=20

Analysis: Constellation's plan to separate into two publicly traded compani=
es=20
has been in the works for over a year. In early 2000 Constellation began a=
=20
restructuring of its corporate identity, dividing its operations into two=
=20
separate segments: one focused on its unregulated merchant energy business=
=20
(wholesale power marketing and generation operations) and the other focused=
=20
on retail services (including the regulated electric and gas utility, BGE).=
=20
As part of this process, Constellation combined its diverse generation=20
portfolio, power plant operations, and development efforts with its energy=
=20
marketing and trading organization. The company has clearly stated that the=
=20
primary reason for bifurcating its operations is to enhance shareholder=20
value. Constellation has said that ""the separation of the businesses will=
=20
illuminate the specific investment advantages of each emerging company and=
=20
allow investors to make decisions based on a clearer assessment of each=20
company's balance of risk and return."" =20

Upon separation, the holding company of the merchant energy businesses will=
=20
retain the Constellation Energy Group name. The holding company of the reta=
il=20
services businesses will become BGE Corp. Current shareholders will own=20
shares in each company when the transactions are completed. In addition, th=
e=20
Constellation board of directors has approved a move to allow Goldman Sachs=
=20
to become an equity owner of up to 17.5 percent in the unregulated business=
.=20
Goldman Sachs has been a partner with Constellation since 1997, providing=
=20
risk management and power marketing services. =20

The split of the business can be seen as primarily benefiting Constellation=
's=20
unregulated operations, which provide the real money-making opportunities f=
or=20
the company. In return, the high growth of the unregulated businesses and i=
ts=20
new status as a stand-alone company is expected to benefit Constellation=20
shareholders. Constellation Energy's merchant energy business is made up=20
primarily of the following subsidiaries:=20

Constellation Power Source, Inc.=01*wholesale power marketing and trading;=
=20
Constellation Power Source Generation, Inc., which has ownership of 13 foss=
il=20
and hydroelectric power plants formerly owned by BGE;=20
Constellation Power, Inc. and subsidiaries=01*development and management of=
=20
existing power plants throughout the United States; and=20
Constellation Nuclear, LLC and subsidiaries=01*nuclear generation  and=20
consulting.

Poindexter has said that delivering solutions to the company's wholesale=20
customers is the foundation of Constellation's business (as opposed to the=
=20
more traditional operations found on the regulated side). Further, the=20
company's primary growth strategies center on the non-regulated domestic=20
merchant energy business with the objective of providing new sources of=20
earnings growth. The company is planning to divest generation assets in=20
international markets such as Latin America and focus exclusively on its=20
unregulated businesses in the United States.=20

Toward that end, Constellation has focused over the last year on aggressive=
ly=20
building its generation portfolio. Currently, the company controls more tha=
n=20
9,000 MW of power capacity, and over the course of this year plans to add=
=20
1,050 MW of gas-fired peaking capacity as well as complete a recently=20
announced acquisition of 1,550 MW of the Nine Mile Point nuclear facility i=
n=20
New York. The goal for the merchant energy business, according to Poindexte=
r,=20
is to establish a portfolio of over 30,000 MW of electric generation=20
facilities by 2005. Up until this point, Constellation's generation assets=
=20
have been primarily based in a mixture of coal and nuclear, and for the mos=
t=20
part located in the Northeastern United States. According to information=20
directly from the company itself, Constellation's own fuel mix is=20
predominantly coal (54 percent), followed by nuclear (40 percent). Oil, gas=
=20
and hydro only represent a small percentage (6 percent) of Constellation's=
=20
fuel mix. However, moving forward, it is expected that nuclear power will=
=20
play an increasingly important role in Constellation's competitive strategy=
.=20

Constellation's merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for=
=20
sales of electric power in the third quarter of 2000, and the company is=20
committed to expanding this growth. Revenues in Constellation's unregulated=
=20
businesses totaled $1.14 billion for year-end 2000, almost half of the tota=
l=20
revenues for the company. Segment earnings for 2000 reflected a shift in=20
earnings from the regulated utility business to the non-regulated domestic=
=20
merchant energy business as a result of the transfer of BGE's electric=20
generation assets to non-regulated subsidiaries on July 1, 2000.=20
Constellation believes that a reasonable range for 2001 earnings per share =
on=20
a total company basis is $3.00 to $3.10. More than two-thirds of the total=
=20
earnings is expected to come from the domestic merchant energy business, wi=
th=20
the remainder coming from BGE and the other businesses that will comprise t=
he=20
new BGE Corp. as part of the business separation strategy.=20

Meanwhile, BGE remains a consistent performer and in fact contributed the=
=20
majority of Constellation's revenues over the course of 2000 ($2.13 billion=
=20
out of a total of $3.9 billion). BGE's fourth quarter electric sales volume=
s=20
increased nearly 7 percent as compared to 1999. This increase in the fourth=
=20
quarter helped to offset a portion of the decline in electric sales=20
experienced during the summer of 2000. BGE will remain a regulated provider=
=20
of gas and electricity delivery services in central Maryland. However, as a=
=20
regulated entity, Constellation apparently believes that BGE will not provi=
de=20
the same level of profit potential as the unregulated merchant business, an=
d=20
therefore the company wants to attract two different sets of investors. =20

FERC approved Constellation's separation plan in early March. The company=
=20
still needs to receive approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and=
=20
the Internal Revenue Service. =20

Also related to Constellation's separation process is a change in the=20
company's common stock dividend policy effective in April 2001. At that tim=
e=20
Constellation's annual dividend is expected to be set at $.48 per share.=20
After the separation, BGE Corp. expects to pay initial annual dividends of=
=20
$.48 per share. Constellation Energy Group, as a growing merchant energy=20
company, initially expects to reinvest its earnings in order to fund its=20
growth plans and not to pay a dividend.=20

Constellation's strategy falls into a growing trend among energy companies=
=20
attempting to streamline their businesses for competitive markets. For=20
instance, last fall American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP) announced its plans=
=20
to restructure into two companies to support a new focus on power generatio=
n,=20
marketing and trading. Under the restructuring, one corporation will hold=
=20
AEP's utility and non-utility subsidiaries whose revenues are derived from=
=20
competitive (unregulated) business ventures. The second corporation will ho=
ld=20
AEP's utility subsidiaries (primarily T=02=15subsidiaries) that are subject=
 to=20
regulation by at least one state regulatory commission, or foreign=20
subsidiaries subject to rates or tariffs regulation. It is not clear if AEP=
=20
will opt to take both companies public. Linn Draper, AEP's CEO, has said th=
at=20
the company is reserving that decision until the end of 2001, the time at=
=20
which he believes the restructuring will have received all the necessary=20
regulatory approvals.=20

In addition, just yesterday, Mirant (NYSE: MIR) completed its spin-off from=
=20
parent Southern Company and is now recognized as a fully independent,=20
publicly traded company. Mirant is a global competitive energy company with=
 a=20
leading position in both power generation and energy risk management and=20
marketing. With an integrated business model, Mirant develops, constructs,=
=20
owns and operates power plants and sells wholesale electricity, natural gas=
=20
and other energy commodities.=20

Other parent companies that have announced the spin-off of unregulated=20
generation companies into stand-alone and possibly publicly traded companie=
s=20
include UtiliCorp, Reliant and Xcel Energy. =20

As noted, the common driver behind the growing trend of spinning off=20
high-risk, high-growth ventures into stand-alone companies is the hope of=
=20
attracting two sets of investors. For instance, let's take a look at the=20
Southern Company / Mirant example as Mirant has just completed its spin-off=
=20
from Southern. Southern Company's P/E multiple is 10.48 compared to Mirant'=
s=20
29.14. The price earnings ratio is typically used to gauge a firm's measure=
=20
of value and can be used to compare a company to its peers and industry=20
average. The average P/E ratio of a traditional utility company is somewher=
e=20
around 12.00. A P/E ratio much higher than the average signals that the=20
company has a high-risk, high-reward profile. However, the general consensu=
s=20
is that the traditional utility investor does not have the risk-appetite fo=
r=20
an IPP-type company. The IPP stock carries more risk than the average utili=
ty=20
and does not guarantee a dividend payment. On the other hand, with risk com=
es=20
reward. Consequently, companies such as Southern, Constellation and the=20
others mentioned are finding that by splitting non-regulated and regulated=
=20
businesses, they can attract two different sets of investors and safeguard=
=20
any possible negative earnings impact that might spill over from one side o=
f=20
the business to the other.  =20

340,"John Novak called me Wednesday to assist in handling a dispute involving EPE 
and the Cuiaba project.  EPE entered into a PPA with Furnas, the government 
entity buying power to sell to distributors.  Furnas is wrongfully 
withholding its consent to assignment required by the banks (OPIC and KfW) 
for financing this project.  We believe Furnas is acting  in bad faith and 
has no contractual right to withhold its consent which gives EPE a right to 
issue a default under the PPA. 
EPE issued a default notice to Furnas and Eletrobras (the guarantor of 
Furnas' obligations under the PPA) in  September of 2000.  The grace period 
to cure the default has expired and EPE is now analyzing whether to proceed 
with termination of the PPA, to initiate arbitration over the dispute, or to 
follow some other course of action.  

Furnas  is using the assignment consent as leverage to hold up financing and  
force EPE to renegotiate the PPA because of commercial risk and loss it has 
incurred resulting from delay of  Phase II of  project.  By way of 
background, EPE issued a force majeure notice under the contract last year 
for delay in building the project as a result of the Mato Grosso attorney 
general's investigation and imposition of tedious environmental measures that 
have caused significant delay in building the gas pipeline to the plant over 
the ridges region of Caceres.    EPE has no contractual obligation to remedy 
Furnas' losses resulting from a valid force majeure delay and no obligation 
to renegotiate the contract.  The PPA contains an ICC arbitration clause 
(arbitration in Paris) and Brazilian law governs the contract.  We are also 
investigating alternative remedies to resolve the matter.  

John Gardiner of Skadden Arps in New York will act as counsel on 
international arbitration.   Fernado Serec with Tozzini Freire Teixeira e 
Silva Advogados in Sao Paulo will advise us on the Brazilian law aspects of 
this dispute.  Please call me if you have any questions 56159.

with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group to manage and administer its
temporary staffing program. This new arrangement is designed to improve
service and quality as well as increase efficiency in meeting Enron's
temporary employment needs. There are many benefits, including a web-based
application which will provide Enron's temporary staffing users with online
ordering, approval and reporting. More details on this system will be coming
soon.

In order to help the Managed Services Group serve you better in the days
ahead, please take a moment now to fill out the profile questions below and
forward your reply to Joseph Marsh at Joseph Marsh/NA/Enron. This
information will not be used for solicitation, but rather to facilitate a

assignment at Enron as we make this transition.  Again, more details on the
Managed Services program and processes will be distributed in the coming
weeks.

As of January 2, the Managed Services account team will be on-site to answer

361,"There are a number of superb initiatives that are being developed and 
implemented 
throughout EOTT that will collectively profoundly change and improve our 
company.
I will give you periodic updates on these initiatives throughout the year.

As an example, Priscilla Norton is doing excellent work to develop more 
accurate and 
appropriate truck cost guides.  This tool is giving us much better knowledge 
about the
true cost to transport crude oil in specific areas across our systems.  As in 
most 
everything we do, this is a real team effort.

I have asked Priscilla to briefly describe this tool and it implementation 
below:
=============================================================

""I developed the Fleet TIME Tool  because I wanted to allocate costs as 
accurately as possible to the individual lease level.   In the past fleet 
cost allocation was based on district averages allocated based primarily on 
miles.   The TIME Tool differs from past practice because it uses actual 
truck hours spent on every EOTT truck haul.  A district cost per hour is then 
established based on number of truck-hours operated in each district, and 
total fleet operating dollars spent in each district.  Using the hourly 
district rate, the Tool calculates district cost per barrel for each ticket 
based on actual truck time consumed.  The resulting data is vital information 
because even though we may already know a district averages 70 cents per 
barrel, we will now know which leases are $0.45 per barrel and which are 
$1.10 per barrel. This improved understanding of actual cost per barrel at 
the lease level paves the way for a much better understanding of lease 
profitability.   With this information, Marketing  can become more 
aggressive, competitive, and confident about our costs when bidding on new 
barrels, and Operations Managers can more easily identify opportunities to 
optimize fleet costs.  

The Fleet District Managers and Marketing have been receptive to the TIME 
concept  and very helpful in providing feedback.    Although the concept of 
TIME as our key cost driver is still in its infancy, Marvin Mills is already 
using the information to identify opportunities to reduce his costs in 
Kansas.    Willie Seale and Phil Elliot  have been using TIME data to 
identify Stations where EOTT could bid the barrels out at a lower cost than 
EOTT's internal cost, and to identify marginal leases to be rebid or 
terminated.     Bennie Orr has been using the TIME philosophy when 
Ark-La-Tex  bids on new business because the Tool has convinced him that 
mileage, by itself  is not a true indicator of cost.  Our biggest struggle 
right now is just getting adequate timely data to meet our needs.

With the help of Patrick Scales, the TIME Tool is currently being moved to a 
server platform using the new Brio software.  Eventually the Tool should 
allow us to have near real-time data at our finger tips.   Future plans 
include adding pipeline barrels and tariff rates to the Tool in order to be 
able to see both pipeline and truck business in the same tool (essential for 
analyzing customers who have both pipeline and truck barrels).  Within the 
next week, we plan to roll the Server version of the TIME Tool out to at 
least one outlying office to begin testing functionality and accuracy, and to 
identify any performance issues.  

Our goal is that the TIME Tool move EOTT to a much greater understanding of 
cost/profitability at the lease level.""

Per my voice mail to you this week, I have obtained the information which
you requested regarding Amerada Hess Corporation's ability to trade on Enron

Amerada Hess Corporation would like to trade gas and power, financial and

We would also like to trade options for gas and power.

Could you run the necessary reports and contact me with our current ability
to trade On-Line?  Also, if we do not presently have the ability to trade

417,"Steve - when you get a chance, please take time to read David Merrill's 
status report below.  Frankly, I think he is trying his best to get on top of 
the EBS tasks we have given him.

HOWEVER, having said that, and before having received his report below, I was 
going to write you an e-mail indicating that I am afraid we cannot continue 
to keep David in this role.  I just returned from Tokyo (office opening,  
meetings, etc.).  There, I saw Sanjay, who confirmed his imminent new role 
for EBS Asia, Anthony Duenner (President, EBS Asia), and Bill White, head of 
EBS Asia Trading.  David simply does not enjoy the confidence of his 
commercial clients in EBS, and, notwithstanding my comments above about the 
level of his effort, I do not see turning this around.  His problem is not 
any single one thing, but a cumulation of things, which I list below, but I 
think it is the totality that feeds the general view:

1)  He was probably only a decent fit with the old Enron APACHI, when it was 
asset-focussed, and he could use his diplomatic experience to open doors for 
projects.  Even then, he was never an ""Enron"" person, in terms of our 
culture, and being isolated in Singapore has probably not helped to get him 
inculcated in the company culture.  With EBS and Enron Asia taking a much 
more ""merchant"" business focus, he just does not get it.

2)  Chris Hunt (APACHI), and Jim Row (ex-EBS) encoureaged him to 
develop/pursue origination leads.  EBS does not want him doing that, and the 
asset-focussed stuff he keeps tossing the way of the enrgy groups is grating 
to them, given that they simply see him as not getting the message that the 
company has moved away from  assets.

3)  Bill White tells me that he (David) has not performed well in a meeting.  
It is a single data point, but Bill is also known to me from Enron Europe 
days, and he is not a particularly critical person.

4)  David only exacerbates this by being insecure about his role, and trying 
too hard to sell himself to the clients/customers internally, and they find 
this teidous.

5)  Frankly, though it is not the only source of David's problems, I think he 
was ill-served by Donald Lassere and XiXi (the associate), who I am confident 
conducted what is know here as a ""whispering campaign"", i.e., ""he does not 
know what he is doing"", ""he is not an expert in the filed"", and generally 
acting like a pair of juveniles when it has come to any effort to bring a 
sense of stability and order to the clients, e.g., ""don't know what I am 
supposed to be doing"". 

In any event, I simply do not see much prospect of persuading the EBS people 
to give David a chance, and I think I will be doing myself no favours with 
them by pushing it.  SO, either we find another role, e.g., in in Washington, 
and I am nor sure they need someone with David's skill sets, or we let David 
go.  Your thoughts?

In terms of supporting EBS Asia, I think the new guy I hired here in London 
could do it quite capably, but all of the biz is either in Houston, or I am 
told Sanjay is contemplating a move to Singapore, so, in eitheerr case, my 
guy here can probably not be effective from the standpoint of being read into 
the business.  From where I am, I would prefer to have someone in Singapore 
or Tokyo, rather than Houston, but the people in Houston may want someone 
closer to them (I frankly think it is a mistake to try to build a business in 
Asia from Houston).  Sanjay mentioned the guy who is his General Counsel at 
Dabhol Power Company, and I will discretely check with Jane Wilson on her 
impressions (but he will not be ""communications"" literate/specialised).  

Look forward to your ideas.   mcs

",,,Enron
419,"Christi,
 As I have been thinking about this problem, my opposition to a standard 
model is declining, partly out of frustration with the slow progress being 
made.  I think, however, that we ought to think about the potential 
consequences of recommending a standard model.  If we simply endorse PJM, 
then we may inadvertently get its warts as well -- no secondary transmission 
market, ICAP market, etc.  I think we are considering the same thing approach 
as was reported by Charles Yeung's in his note on Tuesday's Inter-RTO 
Coordination (Seams) Conference:

""Harvey Reed, Constellation Power, suggested that FERC impose a standard 
tariff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing 
different proposals, but would limit their ability to diverge from a single 
market model.""

 In addition to the standard model, there needs to be a deadline for either 
filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff.  Without a ""feet to the 
fire"" feature, nothing the grand stall will continue.  In arguing for a 
standard model, the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we should 
specific modifications to address our concerns.  On the transmission rights 
issue, for instance, a simple ""don't allocate"" solution won't work.  The lack 
of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the lack of 
information and to the way the rights are defined.  If as Harvey Reed 
suggests, RTOs can submit alternative approaches, at least there will be 
pressure to get moving.  I have not discussed this idea with West Power.  

 It then occurred to me that FERC  is unlikely to impose a standard tariff 
without a rulemaking proceeding.  Whether they could act by fiat or not is a 
moot point, since  I doubt that they would do so without creating a record.  
There are two possible down sides to a rule making.  (1)  The outcome of a 
rulemaking is something of a crap shoot.  The incumbents have a pretty good 
record in the past, of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of goodies such 
as the native load exemption in Order No. 888.  There is a also a distinct 
risk that PJM's ICAP or transmission right allocation process is given 
blessed status, which will make revision of them later to be a huge uphill 
battle.  (2)  The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on current  
RTO discussions.  The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rulemaking 
creates an urgency  to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule cuts off 
options from a new the standard for review.  The uncertainty prior to the 
issuance of Order No. 888 in fact had that effect in the West.  On the other 
hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued.  This 
also happened prior to Order No. 888, with a number of companies sitting on 
their hands, using the time delay to protect existing positions, while 
whipping up State regulators' fears of jurisdictional shift as necessary to 
boost their own position.

 These are only own views.  I have not had a chance to speak with West Power 
this week, but I will approach Tim when I am in Portland again next week.

424,"Current Situation: US and the European Community have proposed launching 
limited negotations in early 2001 with the appointment of working groups who 
would negotiate a limited number of items (as of yet unidentified) with a 
view towards reaching agreement by 2002.

14-16 WTO members believe energy services should be negotiated. Many believe 
that a number of the energy services we have identified are already included 
in the General Agreement on Tariff Services (GATS) and merely need to be 
tweaked for defination purposes. There is also recognition that a number of 
energy services are thought to be included under the existing financial 
services provisions.  We believe this is good news because it reduces the 
amount of bargaining that pro-energy services negotiators may find necessary.

Our trade counsel (Hills and Co with Bob Fisher as our day-to-day counsel)has 
been very involved in the e-commerce issues and starting to get up to speed 
on financial services discussions. Both are quite contentious even among US 
industry. USTR is unable to come up with a common agreed position to advance 
in this sector because of these differences. A new element called 
audio-visual has emerged which Bob Fisher, Steve, Chris and I believe applies 
to our interest in ""streaming."" It too is quite contentious especially with 
the Europeans who want to control this potential item.

Cross-cutting Issues: You will recall in our earlier inside-Enron discussions 
we had made reference to the similarities in a set of general principles 
overlapping energy services, e-commerce and financial services. In a 
horozontal type of negotiation, effectiveness and vigilance in identifying 
cross cutting issues can become critical. These are now emerging as we had 
expected. This means are interests cross over throughout these sectors and 
each presents an opportunity to get liberalization in one sector which has 
application in the others or a bad term in one can have a very negative 
effect.

Concerns? The USTR has been telling various US industry groups that the 
energy services sector is far ahead of others and the USTR feels comfortable 
in an early effort to begin negotiating an energy services piece. That is 
good news. However, the joker in the deck is how agriculture will be handled. 
The Uruguay Round agreed to negotiate services and agriculture. Agriculture 
has the strongest political interest and controversy and could hold services 
hostage unless getting their way.

What do we need? Trade Ministers will be meeting in September to consider 
China's accession. The politics is to get China admitted to WTO at an earlier 
date. The WTO Working Party has discovered a number of problems and issues 
that China wants addressed in their entry document. Such an item as price 
controls on energy services and e-commerce. We're uncertain how important 
that is to Enron but we do know it is of concern to some US companies. The 
politics of getting China admitted could sweep those type of issues under the 
table. The WTO Committee on Specific Committments meets in October and could 
recommend an agenda for negotiations to the WTO General Council. The critical 
task is for the WTO to get the support of the developing nations to launch a 
negotiation.

USTR has asked the Energy Services Coalition to organize and present 
information on energy services in a workshop setting in Geneva in early 
October before the Committee on Specific Committments meets. Attendees would 
be WTO delegations and staff.

To put our best foot forward, we need to get energy companies in non-US 
countries actively involved in the presentation. Some potential countries 
with energy sectors who are strong politically in the WTO are Venezuela, 
Brazil, India, Egypt and South Africa. That will take work between now and 
October 1st to get organized. We have also asked AEI to get one of their 
contacts with developing nation standing to do a paper on the value of an 
energy services provision using Rachel Thompson's paper as a basis. We need 
this by September but don't know if AEI will comply. We met with Claude 
Barfield three weeks ago but he has not responded to our suggestion as yet.  
Rachel Thompson has proposed an outreach strategy run by APCO and Associates 
which is her employer. We would prefer to have Hills and Company run the 
program with people like Rachel providing assistance.

Budget: I have asked Hills and Company to prepare a budget proposal for 2001 
based on the assumption that Enron will continue to lead and provide the 
biggest amount to fund the US effort. If we can get GE, Halliburton and 
others to put in funds that would be excellent but is unlikely to materialize 
without Ken Lay speaking directly to GE, Halliburton and whatever other 
players we can identify. I see from the energy trade press (Energy Daily) on 
Thursday or Friday that Chevron has started an energy services division so as 
a member of ESC they too might contribute.

Our basic cost to maintain what we are currently doing will be approximately 
$320,000 for 2001. The outreach as I see it would require another $200,000. 
Hills and Co. would be responsible for what they are currently doing on 
energy services and e-commerce, the administration of the ESC and the 
outreach program. It would be great if we could get others to put in funds.

Successful to date: We have made good progress to date and believe that we 
are likely to be one of the sectors scheduled for negotiation. The additional 
interest in e-commerce and possibly financial services seems to make our 
leadership and involvment commercially important.

425,"Hi Steve -

I won't be able to make the call on Monday.

I'd be happy to volunteer not to be on the negotiating team.  It sounds
like there's no shortage of people who want to be on the committee.

My big issue is default service.  This industry needs real customers and
the only way to get real customers is to get rid of default service.
Starting with big customers, along the lines of the core/non-core gas
model, is the best way to go.  The only way to sell this, however, is to
get the big customers to agree it's a good idea.

Working Group 1 (WG1) -- Forward Contracts
An interim report was prepared from the work done in the various subgroups 
(attached)
By tomorrow, will have the final ready for the ""principals"" meeting 
tentatively scheduled for Saturday.
Final will include draft RFP, very agressive schedule ending with contracts 
signed by 1/31/01, draft standard contract, utilities' unmet load projected 
for 15 years,  and description of four products: 24x7; 6x16; capacity with 
monthly take or pays; and swing capacity.
The group will likely recommend two simultaneous RFP processes: (1) Davis' 
proposal -- what term and volume will you give me for 5.5 cents; and (2) bids 
with their own pricing and terms to meet the utilities' needs. 

Working Group 2 (WG2) -- Utility Debt
Working on a forbearance agreement
No more information out of that group
Enron in attendence; Houston credit people on Friday.

QF Group
This group met for the first time Thursday evening.
Expected to try to negotiate less volatile (and lower) QF prices using 
long-term gas tolling agreements.

Status of Major Issues from Long-Term Contracts

MAJOR ISSUE FROM WEDNESDAY:  Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they 
want the State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that 
this had been their idea all along.  In their view, the utilities provide a 
forecast and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of 
the utilities. Rest of attendees oppose this approach.  No progress made.
Kind of Auction or RFP -- Seems to be resolved as discussed above. 
Absence of Any State Officials -- Continues to concern participants.  
Everyone standing firm that no deal can be struck without State buy-in and 
relief from litigation and investigations.

Next Steps

WG1 reconvenes at 9am Friday to finish its report and work products.
Apparent joint meeting with WG2 at 10:00 am.
QF Group reconvenes at 2pm

434,"I have compiled the following memo for commercial and regulatory groups to provide information on the potential international greenhouse gas emissions trading market.  It also discusses factors that impact current prices for greenhouse gas emissions transactions and identifies future market influences.  

Given current regulatory uncertainty and the patchwork of greenhouse gas emissions initiatives, a liquid market with a clearly defined commodity is likely several years (or more) away.  However, given the growing interest in compliance hedging, opportunities to package and sell verifiable greenhouse gas emissions reductions could increase in the near future.  Further, with the launch of the U.K. emissions trading program and rule development for the EU trading program expected next year, it is likely that the definition of a verifiable greenhouse gas emission credit will become more clear.

Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions, look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products and, Enron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures.  

Environmental Strategies Group will convene a commercially oriented greenhouse gas strategy discussion on Tuesday morning, November 20 (EB 8C1) to explore these opportunities across business groups.

448,"I have already spoken with the guy at Wisvest charged with re-marketing the assets.  I expressed to him our desire to discuss acquisition of the plants and that we are prepared to move quickly.   He indicated that they are going to take the next couple of weeks to assess how best to re-market these facilities, and that they were leaning towards an ""open RFP"" type process, perhaps with the help of an i-bank advisor.
 
My objective is to steer them away from this path, and in that regard, I gave him a run-down of a number of reasons why they would do well to enter discussions with us ASAP (e.g., unique situation in that we serve load in UI's area, good relationship with the CT regulators, no market power concerns that killed the NRG deal, ability to affect improvements/clean-up at the sites, etc.).  He asked me to send him a letter outlining these qualifiers, and was recptive to a meeting in the near future (I am going to try and hook up with him in CT as he is on business there this week).
 
As for location, these plants definitely are in a good spot given that southern CT is quite constrained.  However, the really binding constraint is in the Norwalk-Stamford area --  these plants are located outside of this area.  I am trying to get some more granular information on the locations/severity of constraints in southern CT to help assess constraints in the Bridgeport-New Haven area where the plants are.
 
One other point is that the one of the units at the Bridgeport station is in deactived reserve (an 80 MW oil plant), so there may be some relatively cheap expansion/repowering plays.
 
I did learn that they have an asset management deal with a 3rd-party through mid next year, unless they sell off the plants before then.
 
I will update with status as we move along

INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing

459,"The SO2 Emissions Credits Inventory transaction with Barclays Bank PLC has been extended for 12 more months as of yesterday, November 6. Barclays has arranged a facility of $170 million, of which $158 million was used as of yesterday. As a condition of extending the term past yesterday, Barclays required collateral in the form of a cash deposit or an L/C from an acceptable bank. We have posted cash until L/C lines become available. The cash raised, net of collateral posted, was approx $98 million, with capacity to put more SO2 credits into the facility. The facility allows Enron to raise cash off-balance sheet without leaving us with short positions in our SO2 book.

As a condition of Barclays accepting cash collateral instead of an L/C, we amended the Swap Master between ENA and Barclays PLC to reduce the number of days to pay to avoid a payment default to one business day from three business days after notification by Barclays. This amendment automatically reverts back to the original three business days immediately upon Enron posting an L/C to replace the cash collateral. Further, Barclays has agreed to review the need for collateral in six months, such that if our credit situation improves sufficiently Barclays will release the collateral while leaving the facility in place.

The terms of the transaction allow EGM to sell SO2 Credits into the facility and call back the credits on one day's notice multiple times over the next year. We pay interest expense in advance as a call option premium; if we call any credits back early, however, we receive a refund on the unused interest expense. The upfront fee was 50bp on $170 mm for the year (though we really have 13 months) and the spread is 65 bp.

473,"Without Detroit Edison, the Moore Power Project involves development of the 
project to supply merchant peak power to the Ontario market starting November 
1, 2000.  Permitting and interconnect agreements would be completed to 
interconnect to MECS as well as Ontario Hydro SERVCO, however, the execution 
of the Detroit Edison interconnection agreement would be deferred 
(optionality maintained).  Interconnection would be made to Ontario Hydro for 
November 1, 2000.

There are three project scenarios going forward:
1. Develop the project and maintain 100% Enron interest
2. Develop the project and sell part or all of equity
3. Sell turbines, and possibly developed site (separate from turbines)


Here is the action being taken at this time:
1. Stop work order and request of all consultants to provide the following:
 -  Confirmation of costs to date on permitting and preliminary engineering 
(just an update of our weekly cost tracking system)
 - Provide costs to completion (permit approval), and schedule
 - EPC schedule for a November 1, 2000 start date, and critical path
 - Costs for the further technical support we require with interconnects etc.
The above will be linked in with the payment/decommissioning schedule for the 
turbines, and interconnect studies/agreement costs (including gas agreements) 
to come up with a total activities, cost and schedule projection to 
completion of permitting (at approval) and interconnection agreements, 
linking that to the schedule for a November 1, 2000 start-up.
2. Compilation of all data on the Ontario market, to provide a picture of 
generation type availabilites, hourly demand trends for each month of the 
year, peak demands for 1998 and 1999 and growth pattern. historical 
generation on the margin, imports/exports, reserve margins, purchased reserve 
support, monthly supply guaranteed at $.038/kWhr and implications on OPGI 
drive to push spot market up during certain months, etc.
3. Confirmation of ICF Kaiser timing and costs for an Ontario market analysis 
and price curve projection preparation as support to a pitch document to 
potential equity participants.
4. Structuring in Houston have been asked to make an assessment of an Ontario 
""bid curve"" based on NY West, and MECS/ECAR curves, winter peak dynamics, new 
market opening volatility (using other market examples), Ontario import 
capabilites etc.  We will also provide the appropriate supply/demand 
information to them.  They will have to support curves into RAROC.


Summarizing the timing:
1. Define costs and schedule to ""develop"" project to point of sale; (Jan 26)

2. Confirm potential of Ontario market, and link to structuring's ""curve"" 
projection (Jan 28)
During this time, seek commitment to re-initiate permit and technical support 
work to complete the permitting phase. 

3. Have ICF Kaiser prepare market price assessment (kick off Jan 28)

4. Prepare information memorandum in support of the project as potential core 
to a pitch book to potential equity participants
(dash type data but with just general financials assumptions plus details on 
market) (Feb 9 first draft)
During this time re-assess interest in developing the asset on our own, or in 
seeking equity participants, or in selling the turbines on their own prior to 
completing the information memorandum.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.",,$1 billion $4 billion,JPMorgan Salomon Smith Barney Our Northern Natural Gas Company Transwestern Pipeline Company Our Board of Directors the Board - William Powers The University of Texas School of Law Special Committee Dean Powers Enron The Securities & Exchange Commission SEC Moody's Baa1 BBB EnronOnline EES Home Depot Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's

We have had personal correspondence over the last 12 years or so and I have admired you for taking the time to write back to me even though I was just an employee and you were CEO.  

Even after all this stuff that is going on, I still believe that you are honest and trustworthy.  I don't understand all that has gone on and probably never will, I just know that after 17 years and being ""stupid"", I had all my retirement in Enron.  I am probably dumb again, but I just used some of my own money to buy Enron stock. I feel that the way to bring the stock back up is to invest and work harder. My father who has Enron stock that came from my deceased grandfather who retired as a NNG superintendent, has also just bought more stock.  We are trying and I know you are too.  

I know that you are going through a lot and I am praying for you and your family.

I am writing as a former London employee whose last day in the office was
Friday 30th November.
I don't know if you are aware but this time of year is the tightest time of
year for recruitment in London both in the temporary and permanent market
place.
I am confident in the skill-sets that I can bring to the current market
place but the average job search takes 2-3 months and unfortunately I do not
have the financial security to enable me to live through that time. That is
why I am asking for a small donation of ?1000 to help me pay my mortgage and
to see me through Christmas.

you will respond positively to it.

 I learned through some of the participants, that the dinner with Fox in New 
York went well.
Derbez, his economic advisor, told me that you were particularly aggressive 
on the issue of 
deregulating electricity and ""dry"" natural gas. I like that, since you 
created a great impression.

 I have been invited to join Mr. Fox on his next trip to Europe, Oct. 1-6, 
along with a group 
of 4-5  Mexican businessmen, that includes Federico Sada and Valentin Diez

in the N.Y. dinner. We will be visiting Paris, Madrid, Berlin and London.

495,"Joe,

Here's a possibility.  Let me know what you think.

Dear Clayton,

Thanks for your note about our new television ad.  Our goal with the ad 
campaign is to increase Enron's familiarity and favorability with business 
and government opinion leaders.  We want to do that by communicating the 
innovative culture at Enron that always asks the question, ""Why?""  When we 
heard businesses blaming poor financial performance on their inability to 
manage weather risks, we asked, ""Why?""  We answered that with our weather 
derivatives product that helps companies protect revenues from unfavorable 
weather.  Now, many equity analysts and other investors are challenging 
companies that don't use weather derivatives as a risk management tool.

In order to get our message across in a cluttered advertising environment, we 
need to create compelling images to get that message accross.  The use of a 
traditional symbol (the old cork gun shooting gallery) applied in a 
non-traditional way (shooting down conventional wisdom) gets the point across 
very directly that traditional excuses don't ""stand up"" to today's markets.  
I think it's a powerful, and humorous, symbolic message.

I'm sorry if you're taking the reference to an old-fashioned game literally.  
I can assure you that no ducks or CEOs were harmed in the making of the 
commercial.  

Sincerely,

Joe Sutton

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE WEEK/ GX's sell-by date

""Global Crossing probably has two years left to prove that it commands a
potentially thriving business. The company now has just short of $8
billion in debt and $2.4 billion in cash, including the $1.7 billion line
of credit the company drew down this summer. In this, the last year of the
network build-out, it will spend another $1 billion on cap-ex in the
fourth quarter, plus make interest payments of approximately $150 million.
Assuming the worst possible case, zero EBITDA in the fourth quarter, and
no IRU swaps at all to lay off some of the cap-ex, GX would end the year
with $1.25 billion in cash.

""With completion of the network, next year's cap-ex budget drops some 70
percent to only $1.25 billion, which is approximately equal to cash on
hand at the beginning of the year, in this worst case scenario. But unlike
this year's cap-ex budget, much of next year's is variable, consisting of
the labor and equipment needed to light up lambda capacity for immediate
sale, or to provide Internet services. No sales, no cap-ex, or at least a
lot less. In addition, the company needs to come up with $600 million in
interest payments. How daunting is this?

""Last year, recurring adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion. In the first half
of 2001 alone, GX sold $1.1 billion in IRUs at margins around 70 percent.
Even in the disastrous third quarter, GX sold $250 million in IRUs. Next
year it could make its interest payments and get through the year even if
the entire business -- IRUs and all -- should shrink by 75 percent in the
face of still booming Internet traffic. Forbes and the market are assuming
World War III. But with World War III, Global Crossing could cut out half
its cap-ex and pile up cash by selling assets. Planned asset sales,
including IPC and Global Marine, the undersea cable laying group, for
which there are already buyers lining up, should produce somewhere between
$750 million and $1 billion, leaving GX's cash position at the beginning
of 2003 better than 2002.

""Ultimately, for GX to succeed, IRU sales must come back and the global
Internet services business must take off, with GX winning contracts from
Forbes 1,000 customers as the primary or secondary carrier, not just a few
goodwill gambits tossed to the new kid on the block.  Grim as it seems
now, the IRU sales side is the most likely place for good news next year,
in part because the Internet business, while growing 100 percent a year is
still relatively small. Expecting total traffic growth of 75 percent this
year, the world's carriers built their inventories accordingly a year or
more ago. The recession intervened, overall traffic growth was closer to
50 percent, inventories clogged, carriers did everything possible to cut
costs, and IRU sales fell off a cliff.

""Today, however, most major carriers are running their networks at 50
percent of capacity or more.  This rate is much too high for comfort for
the bursty Internet data that is the target of Global Crossing's IP
network. The Internet today is around 20 percent of the total growing four
times faster than the rest of the business.  But in the telopolies the
bandwidth buyers are still playing chicken, looking for bargains from next
generation carrier sellers desperate for revenue.  Sellers, including GX
last quarter, have begun to say no. Even with ""modest"" 50 percent a year
traffic growth, the sellers that survive must eventually have their way,
almost certainly before the end of next year.""

FRIDAY FEATURE/ Eric Schmidt Goes Googly

Eric Schmidt is both a lord of the geeks and one of our favorite
all-around observers of the high-tech scene. Silicon Valley pedigrees
don't get any bluer-chip: Bell Labs, Xerox's legendary PARC research
center, Sun Microsystems, then chairman and (until earlier this year) CEO
of networking software stalwart Novell. This summer he piled on two more
titles: chairman and CEO of Google, the upstart (and current runaway
leader) Internet search engine. And he still finds time to think high
thoughts, about everything from the architecture of the Net to the
lobbying game in Washington. American Spectator caught up with him in
August.
Go to http://www.gilder.com/ to read the interview

images to be compressed to a size suitable for delivery over the Internet.
Well worth checking out.
~~~~~~~~~~
FRIDAY BONUS 2/ Internet Taxation

With the Senate failing to act on extending the Internet tax moratorium
and lawmakers not returning to session before its October 21 expiration,
the moratorium on new and discriminatory Internet taxes and the ban on
Internet access taxes will lapse, opening the door to ""economic mischief""
by local and state taxing authorities and implanting further uncertainty
in the already crippled technology market.

If you believe that the net should remain free, head over to the Center
for Individual Freedom's Internet Taxation section,
http://www.cfif.org/legis/federal/internet/tax/index.html, and read up on
the fight against Internet taxation.
~~~~~~~~~~
FRIDAY BONUS 3/ Network Centric Warfare

""We must build forces that draw upon the revolutionary advances in the
technology of war... one that relies ore heavily on stealth, precision
weaponry, and information technologies.""
--George W. Bush, Commander in Chief

To that end, the Department of Defense filed a report to Congress on
""Network Centric Warfare."" http://www.c3i.osd.mil/NCW/ Included in the
report is the book, ""Understanding Information Warfare"" by David S.
Alberts, John J. Garstka, Richard E. Hayes and David A. Signori --
available for download in PDF format, free.

Longer term readers know that we have long believed that
given the wherewithal and the confidence, the American
consumer will spend.  Lately the confidence factor has
been shaken somewhat, but now appears to be stabilizing.
And even though the labor markets have weakened, income
growth is still good.  So, the consumer did what we
hoped for, and to a lessened extent expected - they spent,
big time, in October.

We knew the overall retail sales number would be big, as
in a prior newsletter we had pointed out the incredible
annualized rate of auto sales driven by 0% financing.  And,
of course, auto sales are a big part of overall retail
sales.  What we didn't know, but were impressed by, was
the solid gain in retail sales ex autos.

The important point here is simply that going into the
all important holiday selling season consumers were
willing to spend at a pretty good clip.  This has
nothing to do with cheap financing, and bodes well
for fourth quarter retail sales - an important driver
of two thirds of economic activity.

The downside to the October burst of auto sales, and
the announced plans to continue cheap financing through
year end, is simply that sales are being ""stolen"" from
early next year.  At some point, it would seem relatively
obvious that production will have to slow, which would
slow a recovery, or stretch out the time frame of a
period of sub par growth.  But, at the moment, our
preference is for the recession not to deepen, rather
than worry too much about the slope of the recovery.

The jobless claims number has also continued to improve.
We are not trying to make the case that unemployment
won't go up, it will.  But, the pace of new layoffs is at
least not accelerating, and could be stabilizing.  So,
another bit of good news.

There was also a very significant, at least in my opinion,
bit of news that was a page one story for Investors
Business Daily - to their credit.  The headline was:
""Greenspan Is Upbeat on Productivity, Sees Best Of Tech
Boom Still Ahead"". Greenspan also talked about energy, and
the need for more nuclear power, but my immediate focus
is the productivity issue.

Again, longer term readers know that we were very pleased
with recent productivity data, and thought that as a
recovery unfolds, productivity growth should move up. But,
Chairman Greenspan's views are what count - and for the
moment it doesn't much matter whether he is right.  What
matters is what Chairman Greenspan believes and the policy
implications. The news is good.

Simply put, given his belief that productivity growth will
accelerate, the FOMC will be much less likely to raise rates
sharply as the recovery begins to gain strength - say the
middle of next year.  This is not to say they won't raise rates,
but it does seem likely that they won't be aggressive to the
upside as they have been to the downside.  Good news for
investors - at least in the intermediate term.

For it to be good news longer term, Chairman Greenspan
has to be right and productivity growth must accelerate to
allay our concern about a potential buildup of inflationary
pressures as the recovery strengthens.

At the moment, we will be content with a recovery taking hold
this Spring.  It still seems like the best bet given the
powerful monetary stimulus already in place, sharply falling
energy prices (i.e. the equivalent of a modest tax cut), and
fiscal stimulus.  We like the odds.  Stay tuned !

THE WEEK/Let The Bells Have It

""The lack of cheap, always-on, last-mile broadband connections to small
offices and homes is a short leash around the U.S. economy's neck. Yes,
taxes are too high, especially those on capital formation. We hope
Congress will figure out what every businessman knows: This recession is
investment-led. And yes, the Fed should drop its funds rate to 3%. And
yes, there is huge inventory overhang everywhere you look in IT. If all
that isn't enough to give you a bad hair day, ponder the telco debt bomb
that threatens to blow up Wall Street.

""The dot-com boom started in 1995 and went bust in 2000. Every dolt
imagined he was a venture investor. There was overfunding galore, idiot
businesses up the gazoo--and then pfft. Net Boom, Act II awaits. It will
occur when a catalyst technology changes everything, just as the 386 chip
and graphics transformed PCs. What the Net awaits is obvious: cheap
broadband (enough for streaming video) and always-on connections.

""Already I can hear skeptics howling that bandwidth demand is not a sure
thing, that the dogs will never eat it. But who can forecast demand
without the supply that fires the imagination and stirs entrepreneurs to
create radically new uses, not just extensions? Who in 1984 ever guessed
that most CEOs would use e-mail by 1998? Who in 1989 imagined the
necessity of Web-based supply-side chains, let alone the Web? How accurate
is it ever to gauge, say, traffic for a proposed bridge by counting ferry
boats and swimmers? Forget last-mile as you know it today: clunky DSL or
cable modem service. These are mere swimmers and ferry boats. The bridge
will come when last-mile connections are easy to order (one phone call or
Web click); quick to deliver (the very next day); always on (like
electricity in, uh, 49 states); and cheap ($20 a month or less). When the
dogs are served that, they'll eat till they burst.""

Nobody makes the bandwidth case better than our great friend and tireless
Silicon Valley watcher Rich Karlgaard. Read the full text of ""Let The
Bells Have It"" at

BIOTECH WATCH: Old Stem Cells Do It Better

""All systems were go for federally funded embryo stem-cell research at the
National Institutes of Health. New guidelines bequeathed by the Clinton
administration for skirting a congressional ban were in place. A meeting
to review the first applications for grants was set for mid-April, when
NIH's acting director Ruth Kirschstein suddenly received the word from on
high: cancel the meeting. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G.
Thompson wanted a chance to review the new guidelines. Some NIH
researchers were aghast.

""What's all the fuss about? Stem cells represent a mother lode of possible
new treatments for diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and
more. Capable of differentiating into the full spectrum of other cell
types--from a new liver cell to a new neuron--they could be ideal for
repairing or replacing diseased organs. The furor is not over their
usefulness, but their source: Should researchers use aborted or discarded
human embryos? Or should they be restricted to adult stem-cells, found in
fat, bone, and the brain?

""Those ethical questions are riveting, but they are being trumped by the
market, specifically the venture investment market, which is voting with
its dollars for adult stem-cell research. The universe of established
companies doing stem-cell research encompasses about 30 public and private
biotechnology firms. Of these, fewer than half are involved primarily in
developing treatments from stem cells. And only two of those 15 pure-play
companies do significant work with embryonic cells.""

Dr Scott Gottlieb, Gilder's newest analyst, dives into the stem-cell
debate in June's issue of The American Spectator. Read the full text at

FRIDAY BONUS/Gelernter Live

Venerable Peter Drucker argues that the greatest profits go to whoever
supplies the key missing element in a technology, igniting new spirals of
advance. Think Windows or CDMA and you have the idea.

With an elegant software application called Scopeware, Yale's prodigal
David Gelernter could hold a similar key to unlocking the pent-up power
stemming from the intersection of big bandwidth and data storage--what we
call the storewidth paradigm. At our Storewidth 2001 conference in Laguna
Niguel in April, edited excerpts from a videotaped interview we did with
Gelernter in New Haven earlier this year riveted the house. Now we're
making the full two-hour conversation available for the first time. Tune
in now, at www.gilder.com.

In reviewing the latest gas sale to WGR effective April 1, I found that the referenced downstream contract (CR 27608) that WGR would be using is not valid for April activity.

WGR has  contract 24042 set up for another gas sale effective April 1.  Let me know how you would like me to proceed.

Gore good for health-care, fuel cells 




By Deborah Adamson, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 9:36 AM ET Oct 31, 2000

Latest headlines

NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - As Election Day nears, a key question confronting 
investors is how each presidential candidate will affect the stock market.
At no other time in U.S. history is such a question so pertinent, with about 
half of all households owning equities.
In this article, CBS.MarketWatch.com identifies sectors that will get a boost 
under an Al Gore presidency. On Wednesday, we'll examine the impact if George 
W. Bush wins. See our full election coverage.

CBS MarketWatch Columns
Updated:
10/31/2000 9:37:46 AM?ET




First, a caveat: Despite the campaign rhetoric, analysts said, a president 
has less direct impact on the stock market than do the economic cycle, the 
stock market cycle, the oil cartel, the global economy, the strength of the 
U.S. dollar, interest rates and many other influences.
As such, giving any administration sole or main credit for a bull or bear 
market would be misleading.
Where the government has greater influence is in such things as military 
spending and, more critically, the choice of Fed chairman, said Arnold 
Kaufman, editor of the S&P Outlook, an investment publication published by 
Standard & Poor's. 
Investors also should remember that campaign promises don't always work out. 
That said, analysts have identified sectors that either could benefit under 
Gore, or that historically have done well under Democrats. 
Capital goods
If Democrats live up to their ""big spender"" image, Kaufman said, expect a 
rise in infrastructure spending. That means an impact on the communications 
and transportation, among other sectors.
His favorite stocks here include Sanmina Corp. (SANM: news, msgs), a maker of 
electronic components for equipment makers, and Tyco (TYC: news, msgs), a 
diversified electronics and industrial company.
Sanmina makes electronic components and cables for equipment manufacturers in 
the communications, industrial, medical and high-speed computer markets.
Last week, Merrill Lynch chose Sanmina as one of top 10 tech stocks that are 
expected to outperform in the next six to 12 months.
In the fourth quarter, Sanmina's earnings before one-time charges more than 
doubled from the like period in 1999, beating Wall Street's consensus 
estimate by 10 cents. Revenue almost doubled to $1.27 billion. Company 
profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings.
Tyco sells to the telecommunications, electronics, health-care, industrial 
goods and fire and security services markets. Tyco recently completed the 
acquisition of Mallinckrodt, a specialty medical products maker, boosting its 
position in the respiratory care arena.
Fourth-quarter earnings before extraordinary items rose by 40 percent to $1.1 
billion, or 64 cents a share, from a year ago. Sales went up by 25 percent to 
$7.8 billion. Company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. 
Earlier this month, Legg Mason raised its rating on Tyco to ""buy"" from 
""market performance."" Elizabeth Mackay, chief investment strategist at Bear 
Stearns, includes Tyco on her recommended list.
Mortgage lenders 
A Gore presidency could end an action by some lawmakers to sever these 
lenders' lines of credit from the U.S. Treasury, said Erik Gustafson, senior 
portfolio manager for Liberty Growth Stock fund.
The argument for severance is that these congressionally chartered lenders 
have an unfair advantage over other banking and mortgage lenders. In 
addition, the SEC's new fair disclosure regulation can be expected to boost 
companies with reliable earnings growth, according to Bear Stearns. Stocks 
expected to do well in this environment include Fannie Mae (FNM: news, msgs) 
and Freddie Mac (FRE: news, msgs), Bear Stearns said.
Fannie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Freddie Mac, 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., buy conventional home mortgages from 
banks and mortgage bankers and sells them as securities. Fannie Mae: Company 
profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. Freddie Mac: Company 
profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. 
Health care providers
An increase in government spending on Medicare should boost stocks in this 
sector. Warren Isabelle, president of Ironwood Capital Management, likes 
nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises (BEV: news, msgs).
Last week, ING Barings raised its rating on Beverly Enterprises to ""buy"" from 
""hold."" Beverly Enterprises recently reported a second-quarter profit, 
reversing a loss from 1999. The company's business is improving because of 
increased revenue from Medicare and Medicaid. However, Beverly has taken a 
hit lately because it's adding $50 million to its reserves for patient 
liability costs for 2000.
Alternative energy sources
In his book, ""Earth in the Balance,"" Gore called for the gradual elimination 
of the internal combustion engine and espoused other environmental beliefs. 
As such, alternative energy stocks should do well under his presidency, 
specifically fuel cell companies, said Jim Lowell, chief portfolio strategist 
for Adviser Investments Management.
One stock he likes is FuelCell Energy (FCEL: news, msgs). FuelCell develops 
electrochemical technologies that generate electricity without combustion. 
Last week, Friedman Billings Ramsey raised its rating on Fuelcell to 
""accumulate,"" following Chase H&Q's upgrade to ""buy"" earlier in the month. 
FuelCell also has allied with Enron (ENE: news, msgs) to develop and sell 
FuelCell's Direct FuelCel products. Enron has invested $5 million in the 
company. Company profile, latest financials, analysts' ratings. 
What about tech stocks?
Here, analysts have mixed feelings. Kaufman believes both candidates would be 
good for the sector in general, but Gustafson disagrees, citing the worsening 
of the regulatory environment in the last eight years and the antitrust 
action against Microsoft (MSFT: news, msgs). Lowell thinks Gore's impact 
would be neutral to negative, but analyst Safa Rashtchy of US Bancorp Piper 
Jaffray said the Democrat could be good for Net stocks.
Gore vs. Bush portfolios
Thus far, Gore is ahead of Bush, based on a basket of stocks pegged to each 
candidate's possible presidency. Since Sept. 1, Lisa Kammert, an analyst at 
Birinyi Associates, has been tracking two portfolios comprising 12 stocks 
each that would do well under Gore or Bush. As of Monday, Gore's portfolio 
has outperformed Bush's by 4.43 percent, based on a simple average of each 
stock's return. In 1992, the same model accurately predicted a Clinton win.
In the Gore portfolio are Amazon.com, Yahoo, Citigroup, Bank of America, 
Disney, Time Warner, BellSouth, Duke Energy, Tenet Healthcare, Procter & 
Gamble, Coca-Cola and Waste Management. In Bush's basket are IBM, Microsoft, 
Exxon Mobil, Transocean Sedco, Merrill Lynch, Bristol Myers, W.R. Grace, 
Beazer Homes, Philip Morris and Boeing. Going into the last week before the 
election, Gore has outpaced Bush most of the time since Sept. 1.
As for job growth, a study by executive recruiter Challenger, Gray & 
Christmas indicates that a Gore administration would boost employment for the 
mass transit sector, education, health care, construction (homes and 
schools), agriculture, lawyers, insurance, law enforcement, commercial 
banking and forestry.?

In order to expedite the formation of the escrow account, I am attaching the
signature page to the Escrow Agreement, and ask that you obtain three
executed originals.  Once you have obtained the required signature, please
forward the 3 signature pages to Tremaine Wright at Paul Hastings along with
the executed incumbency certificate, which Kathleen has.  Since we have not
seen the final draft of Escrow Agreement, be sure to tell Tremaine to hold
the signature pages in escrow pending further written instruction from you.
Tremaine will deliver the Escrow Agreement, incumbency certificates, fee

Attached are my changes to the Pompano Agreement. I reviewed the last version 
dated 4-19 which was approved internally (copy also attached), and made 
changes back to that draft where I felt appropriate.

The only section I did not add back in was the termination section. From a 
commercial perspective, I think we're better off leaving it out as we then 
have in effect a free option on the site (as a developers agreement is 
required to obtain building permits). 

Please let me know what you think.

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.

I look forward to your comments.

that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.  Here are 
the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.
What is a cognizant government?  

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligation to 100% of purchase price.  
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another party's 
claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.

Comments?

Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100

More than one Enron official warned company about growing crisis
One staff lawyer grew so worried, he secretly hired an outside law firm to review the company's murky business partnerships. Another executive was reassigned after raising alarms.
By Jake Tapper, Salon.com
Jan. 18, 2002 | In recent weeks, Enron executives have insisted that their controversial -- and ultimately disastrous -- accounting strategies were legally vetted. But Salon has learned that a law firm hired secretly by one of Enron's own attorneys last year recommended that the huge energy trader stop setting up the financial instruments whose exposure later drove the company into bankruptcy. 
At the heart of the Enron scandal are a series of complex partnerships that Enron employed to keep billions of dollars of debt off its books -- thus boosting both its quarterly profits and its credit level. Enron executives participated in these partnerships, earning millions of dollars in management fees and raising major conflict-of-interest issues. 
Embattled Enron CEO Ken Lay has attempted to justify the partnerships by noting that Enron's own staff attorneys as well as those at Vinson & Elkins, its powerful outside law firm, signed off on them. Despite this legal advice, it was reported earlier this week that one Enron executive, Sherron S. Watkins, raised serious questions about the propriety of the partnerships in a memo sent to Lay in late August. Salon has now learned of two other major instances in which Enron executives were told by company colleagues that the partnerships were deeply troubling and possibly illegal. 
In one case, an Enron staff attorney took the extraordinarily unusual step of secretly retaining another outside law firm to evaluate the legality of the partnerships set up by then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
Last summer, before Enron was forced to reveal the actual state of its finances, Fastow moved to set up more of these partnerships. But Fastow's plan was blocked when an Enron attorney named Jordan Mintz took matters into his own hands. According to sources inside Enron, Mintz, who had just moved from the company's tax department to its finance department, was so concerned about the questionable nature of the partnerships -- and apparently so worried that Enron's attorneys were too close to the business schemes to judge them correctly -- that he sought a second legal opinion. 

Without the knowledge of his boss, Enron chief counsel James Derrick Jr., Mintz hired an outside firm far removed from Enron and its Houston-based firm, Vinson & Elkins, to take a fresh look at the questionable deals. After reviewing the partnerships, the respected New York firm hired by Mintz -- Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson -- recommended to him that Enron stop setting up the the shell partnerships. The New York firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to company executives urging Enron to halt the practice -- which they apparently did. In October, Enron fired Fastow. Last month, he hired celebrated attorney David Boies, who represented Vice President Al Gore during his Florida recount battles. 
Contacted Wednesday night, Mintz declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege. When asked about the Mintz retention of outside counsel, Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said ""this is the first I've heard of that"" and declined to comment further. A spokesman for Fried Frank did not return a call for comment. 
Without specifically confirming the Mintz episode, House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Ken Johnson said that worried Enron executives did go outside the company for legal advice: ""(This) happened in a couple instances. There was more than one person who was spooked by these partnerships."" 
It is unusual for a corporate lawyer to go behind the back of his boss, the chief counsel, and retain an outside firm to do work for a company. And it was against standard operating procedure at Enron, where chief counsel Derrick had to approve of any outside legal work. But Mintz apparently thought that Derrick, who had worked at Vinson & Elkins before joining Enron, was too much a part of the company's closed culture, in which dubious business practices had become the norm.
No less than 10 congressional committees are investigating the collapse of Enron, an energy trading company with close ties to politicians in general and the Bush administration in particular. On Wednesday the Senate Finance Committee joined the ranks of nine other House and Senate bodies -- as well as the Departments of Labor and Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service -- by announcing that it, too, would look into the largest bankruptcy in American history. 
On Wednesday, investigators with the House Energy & Commerce Committee interviewed David Duncan, the former Enron auditor with Arthur Andersen who had been fired the day before. 
One of the primary questions under investigation is why Fastow and other Enron executives were permitted to establish complex and secretive partnerships with odd, obscure names -- LJM1, LJM2, JEDI, Chewco, the Raptor entities, Osprey, Big Doe -- that allegedly reaped these partners windfall profits while hiding Enron debt. In November, Enron had to revise its finance statements for the past four and a half years, acknowledging that the company was $600 million in net income poorer than it had led the government and its investors to believe. The Houston company also had to acknowledge an additional $2.5 billion in debt -- much of which came from these murky ""partnerships."" Recent revelations tied to the Watkins memo may result in billions more debt added to the Enron ledger. 
""Someone should have stepped up and said, 'No, you can't do these sort of things!'"" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. But for too long no one did, the employee added. And then when someone finally spoke up, it was too late. 
Currently, much is being made in the media of Watkins' August letter to CEO Kenneth Lay, released on Tuesday by investigators with the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"" Watkins wrote. ""The business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax."" 
But Watkins' letter, said one source, was not the only alarm being sounded within the company before it imploded. In addition to the flags raised by Watkins and Mintz, then-treasurer Jeff McMahon also aired his own growing concern. In her memo, Watkins alluded to McMahon's tribulation, writing that he ""was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of [the] LJM [partnership]. He complained mightily to [chief executive] Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later, Skilling offered him the CEO spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the five steps with him."" 
In the eyes of many Enron executives at the time, McMahon's new assignment was meant to silence him. McMahon ""learned about these partnerships and he thought they were wrong,"" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. ""He thought they were a huge conflict of interest."" McMahon, according to this source, went to Skilling and said, ""'We have this problem, and I think there's a conflict.' Skilling says, 'I'll take a look at it; I'll take care of it.' And the next thing you know, he's reassigned. And it was not a promotion."" To other executives it looked like retaliation against a whistleblower, an Enron source said. 
McMahon ""did go to Jeff Skilling and tell him he was uncomfortable with the internal and external conflicts the LJM partnerships were creating,"" confirmed Enron spokesman Palmer. ""And he told him he could no longer serve as treasurer with those conflincts in place."" As for whether the reassignment was a demotion of any sort, Palmer said, ""It's probably open to interpretation by a lot of people."" 
In August, the same month Watkins wrote her memo, Skilling himself resigned from Enron under mysterious circumstances. McMahon, who replaced Fastow as Enron's chief financial officer in October, did not return a call for comment. 
""We hope in the very near future to be interviewing Mr. McMahon,"" House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Johnson said. ""We feel he has a lot to offer."" Johnson's committee has uncovered a number of incriminating details in the Enron investigation, including the shredding of documents and the Watkins memo. 
A congressional source also reports that such matters may be just the tip of the iceberg, that much more damaging information will be coming out in the next few weeks dealing with the Enron partnerships.

If Enron isn't a political scandal, nothing is
So what if Bush and company didn't bail out Enron? The outrage lies in what politicians did for the company on its way up, not the way down.
By Scott Rosenberg, Salon.com
Jan. 18, 2002 | The collapse of Enron, we now hear, is not a ""political scandal"" -- it's a ""business story."" A fine distinction! So far, no one possesses evidence that government officials lied, goofed around with interns, ran guns from the White House basement, burglarized opponents' campaign offices or accepted bags of unmarked bills. And so a growing chorus in the media now chants that the Enron affair should not be considered in the same class as Whitewater, Watergate, Iran/Contra or any of the other previous brouhahas that have consumed Washington and brought presidencies to their knees. 
This tells us that the scandal yardstick our political and media culture currently uses is bent like a pretzel. You say your president may have finagled a real estate deal many years ago? Time to name a special prosecutor! He lied about his sex life? Draw up the articles of impeachment! But tell us that a high-profile corporation donated millions of dollars to legions of politicians, including the president; bent the government to its will; lined the pockets of its executives while dodging all taxes; then went bankrupt, vaporizing thousands of employees' retirement accounts? Nah, that's no ""political scandal."" Come on -- where're the bimbos? 
Enron's dismal story simply doesn't meet the high bar of triviality the press today demands. The sums of money involved are too great; the flaws in our political system that it exposes are too vast. It's just too real to qualify. 


USA: Enron lawyer raised partnership concerns-Salon.com.

NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - An Enron Corp. lawyer raised the alarm last summer at the energy trader about off-balance-sheet partnerships that helped drive it into bankruptcy, said Internet media company Salon.com on Friday. 
According to Salon.com, an Enron staff lawyer named Jordan Mintz, who was worried about the legality of the partnerships, last summer hired an outside law firm to review the complex partnerships without Enron's knowledge.
The law firm, Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, recommended to Mintz that Enron should stop setting up the shell partnerships, Salon.com said, citing Enron sources. 
The New York law firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to Enron executives urging the company to halt the practice. Salon.com said Enron apparently followed the advice. 
Minz declined to comment when contacted late Wednesday, citing attorney-client privilege, and Fried Frank did not return a telephone call, Salon.com said. 
The partnerships allowed Enron to keep debt off its books, gain higher credit ratings and help boost the company's profile among investors. Concerns about the murky partnerships led investors to dump Enron shares after the company reported its first quarterly loss in four years in October and later reduced its earnings over the same period by about $600 million. Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, the biggest in U.S. history.

Enron CEO under fire again 
Report: Lay knew of accounting problems when he exercised options. 

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Documents say that Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay sold shares of the energy trader's stock after receiving a letter warning of an accounting problem, according to a published report Friday.

The Arthur Andersen internal memos, including a letter from employee Sherron Watkins mentioning a meeting with Lay, were released yesterday by Congress, according to the New York Times. Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, is also under investigation for its accounting methods in the case.

Separately, another report emerged late Thursday that Enron corporate lawyer, Jordan Mintz, hired law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson last summer to take another look at Enron's financial structure. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt worked at the law firm until last fall.

Fried Frank recommended that Enron end its partnership deals, Salon.com said.

The letter from Watkins, written Aug. 15, said she had scheduled a meeting with Lay on Aug. 20 to discuss the accounting issues. Lay exercised options on 93,620 shares for $2 million on Aug. 20 and Aug. 21, the report said.

While Lay did not report selling the shares, worth $3.5 million at the time, Enron officials said earlier this week that some of the money went to repay a loan, according to the Times.

Corporate stock sales must be disclosed by the tenth of the month in which the sale takes place, unless the shares are turned over to the company to repay a loan, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's collapse. The firm's bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2 was the largest in U.S. history.

Thousands of employees lost their pensions and life's savings in the former Wall Street darling's downfall, which began last autumn when the firm acknowledged several hundred million dollars of previously undisclosed liabilities.

The saga has also embroiled Andersen, whose reviews of Enron's finances have come under heavy fire amid the firm's admission that employees destroyed a large number of e-mails and documents related to an audit of the energy trader.  
 

Enron Attorney Asks Judge to Approve Sale of Energy-Trading Operations

Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK -- An Enron Corp. attorney implored a federal judge here to approve the sale of its energy-trading operations to UBS AG in order to bring a ""failed"" business ""back to life.""
Martin Bienenstock, of Weil Gotshal & Manges, which represents the bankrupt energy company, said the core operation -- which generated about 90% of Enron's (ENRNQ) $101 billion in revenue last year -- may lose its value if the deal isn't closed soon. 
If the sale isn't approved, 600 traders and back-office staff could leave in the near future, taking their knowledge of the business with them, according to Steve Zelin, a senior managing partner in Blackstone Group's restructuring division. Blackstone serves as Enron's financial adviser in the deal. 
Under the deal with UBS (UBS), Enron could get more than $2 billion in royalties and other payments, according to Mr. Zelin, assuming that the Swiss bank eventually exercises a buyout option of the bankrupt company's profit stake. 
UBS, which has agreed to pay Enron 33% of the trading business' pretax royalties for at least two years, may be able to satisfy part of its commitment by issuing debt to Enron. 
The liquidation value of the trading operations is $40 million to $50 million, said Mr. Zelin.

602,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

604,"We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Dear Mr.  Shimaitis:
My name is George Huan.  I am a Trading Associate at Enron  North America.  I will be  laid off tomorrow.  Larry May  referred me to you.
I joined Enron's Associate program in August, 2000  after receiving my MBA from UT Austin.  Before that I traded metals in  China.
Because of outstanding performance at Enron, I was selected to  join the Trading Track - a unique program to train future traders.  All  Trading Track associates rotate through several trading related function areas:  risk management, structuring, fundamental analysis, and/or logistics, eventually  leading to a trader position.  Only  13 out of 380 associates were selected. I am proud to be one of them.
As  a trading associate, I worked closely with traders on deal structuring and  pricing. I also administrated Larry's risk book for six months and learned a  great deal from him on option valuation and portfolio management.
I  enjoyed my work tremendously.  Unfortunately, my rotations at Enron went  to pieces with the fall of Enron. I am writing to explore the possibility of  working at Dynegy.
I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you and  discuss further about how my experience will best meet the needs of  Dynegy.
Thanks for your time and consideration.
Sincerely  yours,
George Huan

Registration is open for courses starting in January and February. 
AMU now has courses starting every month!   There are 200 graduate courses to choose from!   We offer 4-Week, 8-Week and 15-Week courses to accommodate your busy schedule!
We have also upgraded our audit option to offer a ""Knowledge Only"" program were students also have the opportunity to earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs).  This type of credit is useful to professionals who are interested in acquiring or maintaining educational proficiency within their respective work discipline.  There are 2 CEU options:  Full and Partial.  Students earning CEU's can get an official transcript to reflect their CEU credits.   To find out more about this program, click <http://www.amunet.edu/GeneralInformation/studenthandbook.asp > 
to go to your online student Handbook under ""Student Enrollment Status."" 
We have a new revised comprehensive student Handbook online in your 
electronic campus <http://www.amunet.edu/campus/default.asp > and in 
our Visitor Center <http://www.amunet.edu/GeneralInformation/studenthandbook.asp >.  
The Handbook includes information on all AMU policy, tuition assistance, Classroom Instructions, and processes like extending a course.
We have a new registration process that's easier than ever!  Students can register from inside the 
electronic campus <http://www.amunet.edu/campus/default.asp >, 
or right from the Course Bulletin <http://www.amunet.edu/Graduate/gcourses.asp >!  
So, use your student ID and password to log on and register now for the Spring 2002 semester!  
Or, if you do not wish to attend AMU at this time, please pass this information on to a friend or colleague that may benefit from AMU's programs.
Please note:  If you have not completed a course in the since Fall of 2000 or before (and are not on approved Leave of Absence), you may be disenrolled in January.  AMU students must maintain satisfactory academic progress by completing two courses within four consecutive semesters.  Disenrollment has no negative effect on your academic standing.  If you are unable to take a course in January or February, you will need to contact us when you are ready to return.  We will review your record and work to reinstate you as an active student under the most current degree plan and administrative processes.  You will also be given ""orientation"" materials, just as a new student would, so that you can be aware of any changes that have taken place at AMU since your last course with us.  If we do not hear from you by January 15, 2002, we will understand that you cannot attend AMU at this time and you will be disenrolled. 
Have a safe and beautiful holiday!

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop (stand alone computer).

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). ","David Oxley

681,"To All Employees:

This morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:

-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.


-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.

-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.

-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.

These are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.

As you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.

For our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.

I know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.

When decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.

On behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.

682,"
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - A radio broadcaster known as ""Dave the Dwarf"" has s=

695,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.",QNEC,,Enron Board of Directors Enron Corp. Savings Plan Plan QNEC Company Matching http://resources.hewitt.com/enron benefits.enron.com

Here is an update of some recent Enron developments.

Enron Europe Closes Certain Operations

Following Enron's credit rating downgrade yesterday and the impact that had on Enron Europe's ability to trade, Enron Europe has asked a court to appoint an Administrator.  What this means is that PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed the Administrator to handle the liquidation of the company's major physical assets and trading positions.  This action does not include Enron Credit, Enron Direct, Enron Metals, Teesside Power Station or the utilities and service businesses at the Wilton chemical complex.  It also does not include Wessex Water or power plants in Turkey, Italy and Poland.

Efforts are being made to preserve as much of the business as possible.  There is already interest by outside parties to buy Enron Europe's metals business, and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal in the near term.

This action will impact a significant number of Enron Europe's employees.  Every effort is being made to retain as many employees as possible who are part of businesses that may be preserved.

Enron Appoints New Board Member

Yesterday, Enron announced the election of Raymond S. Troubh to the Board of Directors.  Mr. Troubh will chair a newly-formed Special Litigation Committee of the Board to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits.  He will also serve on the Special Committee set up to investigate all of the SEC-related matters.  Mr. Troubh is a financial consultant in New York City and has been a non-executive director of more than 25 public companies.  Board member William C. Powers, Jr. will also serve on the Special Litigation Committee.

Enron Evaluates Dividends

Today Enron announced that it is evaluating whether previously declared dividends will be paid on Enron common stock and other Enron equities.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.",Dynegy Mark Muller Lance Schuler Robert Eickenroht Mark Haedicke Rob Walls Greg Whalley,,Enron Dynegy

""He also did this thing where he held the guitar between his legs and played it with a bow.""

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce  that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These  fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average  temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week.  Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement  temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange  website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather  stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International  and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather  products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized  leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has  worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant  Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and  support for these new products.

New Version 8 of the IntercontinentalExchangeTMIs Now Available !

 
ATTENTION ALL TRADERS. We are pleased to announce the release of Version 8 of the IntercontinentalExchangeTM. This latest version has many powerful new features including:
 
Quick Ticket Order Entry 
A Market Maker Window
Options Spreads
Custom Strip Options on WTI and Brent 1st Line Swaps
Weather Derivatives Products
New Portfolio Management Functions
New Multi-Transaction Printing
Trade Ticker Full Day Summary 
An Asterisk Marker Option on Derived Legs of Spreads

 
             
Version 8 comprises Intercontinental's latest development initiative to bring better anonymous, two-way, OTC energy products trading to the electronic marketplace.
 
Installation of Version 8 is Easy 
 
Version 8 will be available for download and installation on your system this evening, Thursday, November 15th. Live trading with Version 8 will begin on November 16th. We have already notified your System Administrators of this new release and provided them with download and installation instructions. 
 
Version 8 is backward compatible with version 7.37 and version 7.72. This means you will still be able to run these older production versions of the IntercontinentalExchangeTM, if you choose to do so. However, since many of the new features, and products like option spreads, custom option strips and weather swaps are only available on version 8, we suggest that you contact your system administrator now, to ensure you will be getting all the benefits that version 8 has to offer as soon as possible.

755,"Yesterday I had a meeting with my staff to review recent events, including the revised earnings announcement last week, the merger agreement and anything else on their minds.  

Perhaps besides the field, this may be the largest concentration of long-tenured employees.   Their personal financial losses are tremendous, especially when considered against their annual compensation.   As might be expected, they express their frustrations and resentments with Enron management.  Still, I am struck by their ongoing commitment to ETS and doing their jobs.  They seem eager to have the opportunity to show our accomplishments to Dynegy when the time is right.   

They ask lots of questions.. most of which I could readily answer.  

Here are two that I could not answer.  I'm hoping HR can help me with responses:

- Prior corp. correspondence said that the Click at Home program is under review.  One employee reported that he tried to log in to order a computer this week and the system was unavailable.  They want to know whether this means that the program has been canceled.

- I received several questions about Savings Plan/ESOP loans.  Is there any requirement for accelerated loan payment if the value of the loan exceeds the current value of the savings plan account?",Dynegy,,Enron

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put

Gerald,

At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company
such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referenced
Agreements for Public Service Company of Colorado (""PSCo"") and Cheyenne
Light, Fuel and Power (""CLF&P"").  I apologize for the delay.  Our comments
are as follows:

Public Service Company of Colorado Agreement

Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues.  We request in Section
4.1 that the $20,000,000 dollar level be applicable to each of our
companies.  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section
4.6 be $25,000,000 as to each of our companies.

2.4 Confirmations.  In the second line, please change ""may"" to ""shall"".  We
need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for
regulatory purposes.  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that
the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed
and returned, in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 2.21
Transactions.

3.5 Netting and 4.4. Offset.  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in
the normal course of business under these contracts.  Amounts due to and
from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes,
especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize if PSCo
or CLF&P acted as Seller to Enron in a Transaction.  Accordingly, we propose
that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the
parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited
to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering
Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the
Agreement.

4.1 Early Termination.  I am concerned that the date to be established for
termination of Transactions is without definition.  I would prefer to see
the language in subpart (i) modified to state that the Notifying Party may
""establish a date, which shall be not less than two (2) nor more than ten
(10) Business Days following the date of such notice.""

4.2 Triggering Event.  In the 8th line down, I don't understand the
inclusion of the phrase ""or deemed to be repeated"".  Unless I am missing
something, it doesn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.  Please
delete this phrase in the Agreement.

4.1 and 4.5 References to Affiliates.  In numerous places throughout the
Agreements and, in particular, in Sections 4.1 and 4.5, reference is made to
Affiliates.  For regulatory reasons, we cannot intermingle the account
status of our affiliated companies.  Moreover, neither PSCo nor CLF&P is
authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated.
Please delete all references to Affiliates of PSCo or CLF&P in the
respective Agreements.

Article 5. Force Majeure.  The language in this Article is not typical of
most Force Majeure provisions, which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure
for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the
ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period.  The language in
your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time
only, for a duration of up to 60 Days, after which time Force Majeure no
longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement.  In other
words, Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence
involving a separate and independent Transaction.  This is not acceptable.
We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard
Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments.

Section 8.1. Notices.  Prior to the language in the parenthetical, please
insert ""provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically"".

Section 8.2.  Transfer.  We would prefer that this language be revised to
the more traditional language requiring the consent (rather than approval)
of the other Party, ""which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld"".
Please modify this provision accordingly.

Section 8.3.  Limitation of Remedies.  We are in general agreement with this
provision, however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of
merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use.  The gas sold and purchased
under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the
ordinary use to which it is intended.  Please modify this Section
accordingly.

Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions.  The GISB
Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day
confirm deadline, rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition.  We
request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry
standard.

Definition of Material Adverse Change.  This definition needs to be expanded
beyond a review of the level of each company's credit rating.  Please
replace your definition with the following:

	""Material Adverse Change"" with respect to a Party means (i) any
downgrading of any unsecured, long-term senior debt of such Party 	or
any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit
support for the obligations of such Party (each such entity being a
""Credit Support Provider"" for such Party) such that such debt is
rated below ""BBB-"" or its equivalent by Standard & Poors or below
""Baa3"", or its equivalent, by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.; 	provided,
that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	any
unsecured, long-term, senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard &
Poors or Moody's Investor Services, Inc., then a 	Material Adverse
Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which, in the
reasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a material
adverse effect on the creditworthiness, 	financial responsibility, or
ability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider, as applicable, to
perform its obligations in connection 	herewith.

Definition of Replacement Price Differential.  Although we are in general
agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential, it seems
preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable, cost of
cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day
average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred.
Please modify your definition accordingly.

Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power Company Agreement

Our comments with respect to this Agreement are identical to those stated
above regarding the PSCo Agreement, with the following exceptions:

Section 4.2. Triggering Event.  The dollar levels near the end of the
Section should be equivalent between our companies.  Please make each
$75,000,000.

Section 4.7.  Collateral Requirement.  Similarly, the dollar trigger levels
in this provision should be equivalent between our companies.  Please make
each $25,000,000.

Except for the foregoing, please make changes to the Cheyenne Agreement
consistent with our comments to the PSCo Agreement as set forth above.
Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes,
you may contact me via return e-mail or at the phone number listed below.

finalize these Agreements.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

Two men were about to tee off on the 18th tee box.
Their wives were waiting for them at the club house.
The first golfer tee's his ball.  As he addresses the
ball, he looks at the club house.  Then he chokes up
on the club.  He looks at the ball and then up at the
club house.  He loosens his grip and closes his
stance.  He again looks at the club house. He again
looks down at his ball and chokes up a little more on
his golf club.  He looks back up at the club house.
Finally his partner says ""Forget it, you can't hit her
from here"".

I have reviewed the latest draft of the LOU and the document reflects all the 
changes with one major exception, the purchase price not reflecting a value 
of $204 million.  On Friday morning, I spoke with Mark Whitt and thought we 
had come to agreement on a basket of negotiated items, the Purchase Price, 
Specified Geographical Area, and Buyer's Rights.  It was my position that 
these items were all tied together.  In the subsequent meeting in the 
afternoon, you and I participated in a meeting with ENA concerning final 
comments on the LOU.  Their earlier meeting with Dave DeLainey was discussed 
and nothing was mentioned concerning the purchase price when discussing 
changes to the LOU.   Northern Border did bring up the discussion on an 
exclusivity clause.  A change in purchase price was not discussed by ENA.  

In addition, on Friday afternoon John Jesse and I had a conference call with 
Ranabir Dutt and Brian Bierbach concerning the note term sheet.  It was 
agreed that Northern Border would pursue a note with its bank syndicate and 
rely on ENA in a fallback situation, if John through discussions with bankers 
next week gets comfortable with that approach.

I am surprised at $205 million purchase price in ENA's latest LOU and will 
talk to Mark about the purchase price on Monday morning before the meeting 
with Gulfstar.  If ENA does not agree with the $204,000,000.00 purchase 
price, Northern Border will have to make adjustments in the Buyer's Rights 
section.  Clauses (i) and (ii) will need to be deleted, as this was agreed to 
by Northern Border at a $204 million purchase price.   In addition, this 
might affect Northern Borders comfort level in relying on ENA in a fallback 
position for a note, as Jerry Peters had expressed some concerns to John and 
I regarding this approach. 

I will try to call you before 11:00 a.m. on Monday  to give you an update on 
this matter.

she indicated that this contract did not exist in their system.  They do not 
have any documentation.  Their contract nos. start with 028......she is not 
aware of OPLC Synthetic as their contract no..  Therefore,  the other Parking 
and Loan Agreements effective May 1, 2000 are not the same contract.  
Further, the documented status confirms that no paper exist and was setup in

I will probably terminate this contract in Global Contracts becasue it 
appears that it was setup in error. In fact, the contract does not have

As per our discussions: I believe that I did not keep a copy of the mid-year 
performance review that I sent to you inter-office for Eric Gillaspie.  Since 
the report has been misplaced, to expedite your review, I have outlined my 
comments on Eric's performance below ( I have used the ENA Commercial form, 
hope it fits your needs):

Skills/Behaviors
Innovation/Entrepreneurship -  Rating: Strong
Eric has been very keen on learning the various facets of Interconnect 
Agreements. He has come up the learning curve quickly and he has been very 
insightful and helpful in crafting a document that includes a well founded 
commercial document.  
Communication/Setting Direction - Rating: Strong
Eric is very clear and concise in his work.  He seems very aware of both the 
commercial requirements and the preferred form of Interconnect Agreement 
terms and conditions of the Legal department.  He does a strong job of 
directing his work to maximize the goals of both units.

Teamwork/Interpersonal - Strong
Very easily joins in on a team effort - Gateway Interconnect Agreement for 
example - and makes a positive contribution.  My experience with Eric is that 
he has a strong personal presence that he uses to achieve his objectives in 
an easy yet successful manner.

Leadership/Values - Excellent
Eric always seems to have an excellent knowledge of the legal and commercial 
requirements of the interconnect agreement and he readily shares this 
knowledge to win his position.  His strong skill set lends a leadership 
quality to his work that is very strong.  Regarding Enron values, Eric is a 
great example of our Vision and Values Program.

Business Instincts - Strong
As Eric has been learning the strategy that the Generation Marketing Group 
is  following with regard to interconnecting as many as possible with a 
minimum of expense and risk exposure, he has been making more and more 
commercially and legally sound recommendations

Analytical/Technical - Satisfactory
Eric has showed a satisfactory set of legal skills to enable him to construct 
the agreements which we have worked on over the period.  I believe that as he 
spends more time at Enron and comes up on the experience curve he will become 
even more skilled and technically strong performer.

Overall Rating - Strong

Qualitative Comments
Interaction Experience: Eric is very approachable and is always willing to 
tackle a new assignment.  He is easy going yet is firm in his positions.  He 
seems to want to ""study"" a problem sometimes as opposed to making a ""snap"" 
decision.  When he does take this time the results are usually very 
satisfactory.  He produces a quality product that will get even better as he 
gets more Enron time under his belt.  He is timely with his work and has been 
very helpful in creating numerous interconnect agreements for Gateway, Rio 
Nogales, Alstom and Chambers Energy among others.

Major Strengths: Is able to produce needed work in a professional, accurate, 
and timely manner.  Appears to have a good grasp on the legal concepts I have 
needed assistance on to date.

Continued Development: I think that traditional Enron in house courses as 
well as outside conferences and workshops that cover areas pertinent to Enron 
projects would help in Eric's overall understanding of our commercial 
businesses.

Your Date of Migration is: October 23rd

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

1.  How much would this pricing change if power could be called ion 4 hour 
blocks and the availability percentages were 97%?
       - 4 hour block call: There is a possibility to get better pricing.
 - 97% availability: Structuring wants to make sure that there is no 
regulatory limitation in related to environmental issue, which may prevent 
97% availability.

2.  What pricing does the 20 year project model show that we need?
 - We also need power curve from year 3 to 20 to calculate Calpine's merchant 
revenue.
 - We are currently refining the model regarding IDC, residual value, etc.

3.  What additional information do you need from me to complete your analysis?
 - Unit contingency or liquidated damage protection
 - Exact location for power and gas

Once we find out unit contingency and location, I will get the pricing with a 
couple of scenarios as you asked: 
 - Flat and annual capacity for 3 and 5 year
 - Power curve from year 3 to 20

853,"Team,

We've done a lot of good work lately on the evaluation models and I think we 
are converging on a platform that accurately models the product, the project 
and my structure's risk.  The only remaining issues when we're done will 
relate to the curves.

Just so we're all on the same page, I thought I would lay out the base 
scenario:

Hourly vols
Mid power and oil curves
Beginning debt of $375/kw amortising mortgage style over 20-years
Debt interest rates of T+225
Plant residual value of $100/kw
Enron will own a 50 MW call from 5/2001 to 12/31/2020.  Strike prices will be 
$50/mwh for years 1-5, $75/mwh for years 6-10, and $100/mwh for the balance 
of the term.
The basic put or no put trigger algorithm is (plant value + put option value 
>= par amount of bonds outstanding).  As the model calculates equity's 
decision whether or not to put the plant to Enron, we should reduce each 
years par amount of bonds outstanding by the debt service reserve fund.  This 
proxy's the fact that equity will consider when making their put decision 
each year that there are moneys in the DSRF, working capital reserves and 
equity sweep accounts.
Whatever power/oil correlation's structuring thinks are appropriate.

I hope to see results Monday.  If there are any questions, please call me at 
3-4750.

regards,

Don Black",Don Black,375 100,Enron the debt service reserve fund DSRF

864,"Attached is an updated version of the daily file that I sent earlier this
morning.  The only change is to the volumes for NIPSCO.  All other volumes
should be the same as those in the earlier version.  sorry for any confusion.


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 4/10/00 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
""Daily Change' worksheet.

875,"As some of you may have seen through the e-mail system, Enron Corp. has begun 
a payables and procurement initiative under the name ""iBuyit.""  The 
initiative involves the implementation of an on-line procurement and payables 
system, the central focus of which will be to enable Enron to better track 
vendor expenses and overall costs. 

The implementation of the payables portion of the system will occur on May 1, 
2001 and will be applicable to all organizations supported by Houston-based 
Accounts Payable processing centers (e.g., our Legal Department).  I have 
been asked to be the stakeholder for this project for the Department and have 
been working with Dina Snow and Carolyn George (as the Department change 
agents) to get up to speed on this program and its impact.

Given that this program will present a marked changed in the manner in which 
we will be coding, reviewing and approving invoices for payment, it is 
important that each of you have an overview understanding of the system and 
how it will function.  This, in turn, will aid you in determining the best 
process to be implemented within your particular group for use of the 
system.  To assist in this general understanding, the iBuyit group prepared a 
system demonstration running through the functionality of the system and 
answering some general questions as to its use.  I believe it provides an 
appropriate overview and have provided the below link to the demonstration 
location:

http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/iBuyitPayablesPresentation.ppt

Mark has asked that I speak on this program a bit at the upcoming OGC meeting 
(Monday, 4/23) and answer any questions you may have.  In the interim, if 
there are any questions about the program or the system's functionality, 
please do not hesitate to call me.

896,"Richard: 

Tom Hatch (Robbins, Kaplan), Robin Diem (Hirschmann), and Steve O'Donnell 
(Piper, Marbury) asked questions today.? None was as aggressive as, nor had 
the presence of, Kathy Patrick.? However, Tom Hatch is quite good and 
definitely to be taken seriously.? The other two made little impression.

A lot of the questions today focused on Thai graft and corruption, with the 
suggestion that Busse, Stickler, and others (implicitly Enron) knew that it 
was there and did not really do anything to try to stop it.

A number of questions resulted in the appearance (perhaps true) that the 
Managment Company never really functioned, certainly not effectively.? The 
argument was NOT that the Management Company did not have enough power, but 
rather that the Management Company effectively abdicated, leaving everything 
to Schultes.

All of this made me slightly nervous.? I wonder if the bondholders could 
argue that the members of the Management Company has a fiduciary duty to the 
bondholders during the months after the offering to exercise the power that 
they had to stop graft and improve operations.? If there were such a legal 
duty (and there may well not have been), then the facts would probably not be 
good for the Management Company members.

In fact, the way that the Managment Company LLC agreement was structured, all 
power was in the hands of a single individual manager--David Stickler--and 
the only power that the members had was to remove Stickler (which would have 
required unananimity between ECT Thailand and SDI).? Although the Managment 
Company had a few ""meetings,"" it is not clear what this means or, legally, 
who met at all, as the management Company had no board or governing body 
other than the individual manager.

Other themes: 

??????? SDI was having trouble with its own DRI facility and really wanted 
access to information about NSM's DRI facility.

??????? Everyone knew that John Schultes had no minimill experience (and 
might be corrupt) and that the project would fail unless Nucor or SDI agreed 
to run it, which neither did.? Stickler kept picturing SDI as managing NSM, 
but SDI steadfastly declined the role.

We should finish tomorrow.

905,"Now that two settlement proposals and a motion to extend time have been 
filed, there is no telling what the CPUC will do.  My recommendation is that 
we play it safe and assume we will need to file testimony on April 17.  To 
that end, it's time to review some basics.

In its July 8, 1999 decision, the Commission stated:  ""We see reason to 
pursue a change in protocol for receiving gas at Hector Road, even in the 
short term.  If there are burdens that would unfairly fall upon Transwestern 
customers is a window was established at Hector Road, we want to hear about 
it in the next phase of the proceeding.  In addition, we seek specific 
proposals as to how such an arrangement should be defined.""

Accordingly, the testimony we file should explain:

1.  The unfair harm that could potentially befall TW customers if Hector Road 
were established as a formal receipt point
2.   Our proposal for making Hector a formal receipt point by establishing 
primary and secondary receipt points
3.  Why our proposal is fair and consistent with Commission policy (here we 
might want to draw analogies to the interstate system and explain why that 
works)

I will also have an opportunity to make legal and policy arguments in a brief 
after testimony has been filed.

Let's discuss how best to go about drafting the testimony.  I think the best 
thing to do would be to outline the testimony, then decide who is going to 
say what.  I'm available after about 2:00 today.

922,"With regard to your questions, I have written my answers in red below: 

1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6.  
I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any 
circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?

This is something that should be run by Paul Simons in London as our EMU 
wording came straight from him. He would know what Section 6 refers to (I 
don't) and whether we should agree to its inclusion.

2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option 
Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions.  
Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do 
this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a 
general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any 
FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed?  
They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating 
this.

I didn't even know that the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions existed and I wonder 
what the purpose is.  Seeing as how the 1998  FX and Currency Option 
Definitions came out in 1998 (the same year as the Euro Definitions) one 
would think that any necessary euro/FX/currency  language would have been 
incorporated in the 1998 FX Definitions, instead of making a separate 
definitional booklet.  You might ask Dresdner what they think it adds to make 
reference to the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions. You might also look on the ISDA 
Website or ask Paul Simons (in case he knows)  to see if ISDA intended for 
the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions to supplement the 1998  FX and Currency Option 
Definitions. 

If we did include such a reference to the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions, then 
they would be deemed to apply to any FX or Currency Option Transaction, where 
relevant.  

With regard to electronically confirmed transactions, this point is addressed 
in clause (a) of our FX language.  This wording is something everyone wants 
to have in their Agreement since most FX trades and some Currency Option 
trades are confirmed over an electronic messaging system that doesn't use 
ISDA style confirms, and thus doesn't refer to any ISDA Definitions. 

Hope this is helpful - call me if you want to discuss anything.

I'm not sure that what I told you to do in the CSA Annex with respect to 
Custodians and their qualifications work so for now let's keep it out and go 
back to our old language.

Sara and Mark:
Shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our CSA Annex language 
where we talk about the circumstances under which a party can ""hold"" 
collateral, all of our triggers are based on something happening to our 
counterparty and nothing is said about what would happen if a Custodian holds 
the colateral and fails to be creditworthy.  Do you have any thoughts on 
this?  At first I thought that we should require the Custodian to be a 
Qualified institution but I'm not sure that that is the right approach.  Let 
me know what you think.

926,"As you are aware TD were concerned about the basis risk embedded in the 
prepaid swap structure . They plan to hedge their Enron exposure by buying 
credit default swaps in the market. However under credit default swaps, only 
a default on debt as defined by GAAP is  included as a credit event, and 
swaps are excluded from this definition .  This basis risk  therefore occurs 
where  Enron defaults on the oil swap but has not defaulted on any debt. This 
does not trigger a payout to TD under their credit protection, their recourse 
will then be through  the Corp guarantee with time delays. 

To mitigate that risk it was proposed that  in the event of an Enron default 
under the prepaid swap, the MTM termination value of the swap would be 
converted into a loan and Enron would automatically default on that loan. 
TD's counsel came back late on Friday to say that they could not give a clean 
legal opinion on this  structure.

We therefore proposed an alternative structure which involves TD and Enron 
entering into a loan of $10.1m at the same time as the swap is executed. This 
loan will  be in the name of Enron Corp. In the event of an Enron default on 
the prepaid swap, this will cross default into the $10.1m   loan and that 
forms the required trigger for TD's  credit default swaps.   The lawyers 
signed off on this last night and Norton Rose are now preparing the loan 
documentation.
They are basing it on the May 2000, 364 day Enron Corp facility and we are 
expecting first draft tomorrow. I will forward this to you when I receive it.


The deal itself is still undefined as TD have  credit approval subject to 
presyndicating the loan to two other banks and putting a certain level of 
credit protection in place prior to executing the trade.
The confirm/term sheet has not changed from two weeks ago and I have 
forwarded Sara's  comments to TD but their focus has been on getting credit 
approval rather than docs until today.  We have not sent a confirm to Morgan 
Stanley yet as we plan to replicate  whatever  confirm we agree with TD.  

I will keep you informed as to TD's progress.

In the spirit of ""full disclosure"", I thought I would let you know what ENA 
has agreed to on the ISDA side with various Merrill entities.
ENA has ISDA's with Merrill Lynch International Bank (8/25/95), Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services Inc. (12/2/92) and Merrill Lynch International (8/25/95).
There is no arbitration provision in any of these agreements; there is merely 
silence as to jurisdiction (ENA began negotiating arbitration around 1997).  
All of these agreements contain our standard limitation of liability language 
(in boldface) and all permit some type of assignment to an affiliate (in 
general, without negative tax impact or with sufficient credit support).  All 
of the agreements provide for setoff (including affiliates of non-defaulting 
parties) and all contain confidentiality provisions.

I would therefore propose the following changes to Annex I:

change the margin deadline time to 10:00 a.m. (NY time)
delete Par 9(b) - and you can send your additional no custody required 
language
delete the arbitration provision in its entirety

I hope that you can resond to the remaining issues tomorrow morning so that 
we can finalize docs by the afternoon.  Thanks for your assistance.

I was hoping you could respond to some issues raised by Enron's Argentine 
commercial group.  They have told me the following:

(1)  An association known as the ""Argentine Association of Derivatives"" has 
developed a document currently being circulated in the Argentine market for 
use in the near term.  It is in Spanish and it is not an ISDA.  It is a 
""short"" document (i.e., much shorter than a standard ISDA Master Agreement 
and ISDA Credit Support Annex).

(2)  This document is being prepared by experienced professionals.  Are you 
involved in this effort?  Is ISDA involved?

Perhaps we could schedule a conference call and/or you could provide me with 
an accurate account of any local activity in connection with the foregoing.  
If ISDA is not being used in Argentina for commodity swaps and derivatives, 
Enron needs to understand the issues and current discussions about 
derivatives transactions.

982,"Per our conversation with Dan F., ENA needs to understand issues related to 
the distinction between ""investor owned utilities"" (or ""IOUs"") and municipal 
utilities (or ""municipals"") in connection with derivatives activity.  In the 
U.S., this distinction enables us to treat IOUs as general corporates.  Thus, 
we negotiate our standard ISDA Master with an IOU, except that we add an 
Additional Termination Event to prevent the IOU from taking an adverse stance 
in its state public utility commission proceedings.  A copy of that 
Additional Termination Event is attached for your review.  Our approach with 
respect to municipals is dramatically different.  When negotiating an ISDA 
Master with municipals, we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U.S. 
Municipal Counterparty Schedule, having additional reps, the added concept of 
""Incipient Illegality"" and an enforceability opinion.  A copy of that 
Schedule is also attached for your reference.

We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada, 
and if so, in all Canadian provinces, and whether there is a distinction when 
a municipal is an investor in an IOU (as we understand that the government 
may assist a utility to emerge from bankruptcy).  In that regard, would you 
recommend that ENA use distinct ISDA Schedules for these types of entities 
and/or would you recommend specific changes to our format?

1059,"Carol:  I'm glad you've identified these specific line items.  I think credit 
should have a ""separate worksheet"" and make a determination for each question 
you've listed.  For exampe, I think the GP should be a Specified Entity.  One 
issue I've experienced with credit is the existence of several LPs in a given 
structure, only one of which owns any operating assets, and there are no 
financials for that LP, but only financials on a consolidated basis at a 
different level.  How does credit identify the counterparty, much less 
determine if that counterparty is an ESP?

I also wonder how many partnerships we have agreements with which may be 
inadequate.  And, when credit approves omnibus Transactions with a 
partnership, is it making a sufficient analysis?  A separate list would help 
in the evaluation.

Are we going to have another credit lunch?  Hope all is going well.  Sara

1117,"Last Friday, Patricia Arce, (Mario Arce's daughter and a full time  ASMAE 
employee) was expressing her [distorted] views  to the press on why 
generating companies should not abide by Annex V. She was not speaking on 
behalf of ASMAE: however, she was probably reflecting ASMAE view. 

I did not mean to shoot the messenger, but I could not refrain myself from 
expressing an opposite opinion.

There are two problems in Patricia's view:

1) She is not supposed to express any views on contracts. MAE should only 
settle contracts, but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract 
disputes. The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAE's 
frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II - Furnas conflict in the last 6 
months.  Informativo Regulat?rio # 4 explores the issue in more detail.

2) She was dead wrong. Quite na<ve arguments. 



A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V (we may use externally, 
as you see fit)

1) Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts.
 * So what? It is a regulated contract by nature, as so many others, such as 
CUST, CUSD, CCT, CCD. Does it mean that parties signing those other 
agreements should not abide by their clauses?

2) Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions
 * So what? I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement 
without any chance to negotiate its terms (it is by definition an adhesion 
contract). Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement 
provisions? Guess what the answer was? None

3) Some Gs did not sign Annex V - e.g. Furnas, which [apparently] disobeyed 
Annel's instructions (as per Law 9.648/98)
 *  This is serious
 *  That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract, those Gs do not 
want to abide by Law? No response

4) Some companies do not have Annex V
 * So what? Discussion is about Annex V
 * Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts

6) Ttariff (energy price) was not subject to negotiation as part of the 
Initial Contracts - therefore, they were not able to price the risk 
represented by Annex V
 *  So what?
 *  Many contracts have regulated prices. All use of system contracts have 
regulated prices.
 *  Furthermore, the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V 
risk. Why giving them a windfall now? (Since it is a zero sum game, a 
windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors)

7) Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing: it was designed to 
mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch
 * Wrong
 *  ERM (Mecanismo de Realoca??o de Energia) was the mechanism put in place 
to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool 
operation
 *  Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing. It is called ""dry 
period relief"" clause. It was proposed by the generators and approved by 
Annel. The spot price is a ""proxy"" for the depth of rationing. One should not 
evoke rationing.


I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is 
""bullet proof"". In the meantime, let me share my views:

 * There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on 
the [ridiculous] proposal made by generators that merchant plants should 
collect part in cash and part of their sales in [junk] bonds. We should make 
this clear at the outset. 

 *  We should make Minister Patente realize  that Mario Arce's proposal is 
non-sense. Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices  is 
a bad precedent. No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known 
risks. A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and 
Fonte-Cindam (and became a public scandal) .  If we do want to create a 
market , we need to have responsible contracting. Irresponsible contracting 
should not be forgiven. If we do it, we will create a bad precedent and a 
poor environment for contracting. We have to show Minister Parente that 
irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates (no caps on 
spot). Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity. Breaching contracts 
will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs. Crisis will get worse and 
worse.

 *  Generators should have the burden of proof.  In the meantime, Annex V is 
effective and should be enforceable

 * Regarding California case, as mentioned by Mario Arce: It is a totally 
different situation. In California D/Cs were not allowed to contract. In 
Brazil they were strongly encouraged. Generators who signed Annex V could 
also have hedged their residual risks on Annex V.They did not. They acted 
irresponsibly. They second-guessed regulations. They did not help in 
expanding capacity. They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex 
V. 

 *  The argument ""no one should lose, no one should gain"" during rationing is 
inconsistent with market signals. Some one has to lose, some one has to gain 
by definition. And [hopefully] someone has to go bankrupt. This will be a 
great lesson. People will start taking market signals more seriously. 
Otherwise, there will never be expansion and there will never be a market.

 *  We have to be as transparent as possible.

Finally, I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V 
and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week. 

I volunteer to prepare a first draft, if you guys agree it is a good idea.

RE: FERC Clarification of Market Mitigation Procedures

On Friday afternoon, the Commission issued an Order clarifying certain 
aspects of its April 26th Order on mitigation measures.  While not addressing 
the rehearing requests or the CAISO compliance filing, the Commission 
established procedures for the CAISO to use alternative information from a 
comparable unit for generators that refuse to provide heat rate and emission 
data to the CAISO.  If an alternative source of data doesn't exist, the CAISO 
can assume the generator is a price-taker and use a bid of $0/MWh for all 
available capacity from that unit.

Second, the Commission rejected the CAISO'a approach to calculating the proxy 
gas price and directed the CAISO to calculate the price using the published 
daily price for Malin, PG&E CityGate, Southern California Border (Kern River 
Station), SoCalGas large packages and PG&E large packages.

Third, the Commission rejected the CAISO's decision to apply price mitigation 
only to the Imbalance Energy Market and not to Ancillary Service spot markets 
or Adjustment Bids.

Finally, the Commission granted a request by several California cities to 
require that a creditworthy buyer be in place for all must offer power.

The order is attached.  If you have any questions, contact Julie Simon at

1. You will continue to receive the same EnPower/EOL summary, complete with

I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible.

2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this 
count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each 
desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and 
subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce

06/08/2000
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- McGraw-Hill Cos., on behalf of its Standard & Poor's 
Corp. unit, has filed a lawsuit in
federal court charging the Vanguard Group Inc. with breach of contract and 
trademark infringement in connection
with the mutual fund company's proposed new Vipers exchange-traded funds, or 
ETFs. 

McGraw-Hill's suit alleges Vanguard breached the companies' 1988 license 
agreement by using Standard & Poor's
proprietary indices and trademarks for the Vipers exchange-traded products 
without permission.

Officials from Vanguard, the nation's second largest fund firm, weren't 
immediately available to comment on the
lawsuit. 

Exchange-traded funds are a hybrid version of index mutual funds that can be 
bought or sold during the day at
market prices instead of at the once-daily 4 p.m. price used by traditional 
mutual funds. ETFs are single shares of
stock that replicate an index such as the Standard & Poor's 500. 

Standard & Poor's currently has more than 400 license agreements for uses of 
its indices and trademarks, including
agreements related to ETFs, according to McGraw-Hill. 

McGraw-Hill wants to prevent Vanguard from using S&P's indices and trademarks 
in connection with Vipers or any
other exchange-traded security. The complaint also seeks an order requiring 
Vanguard to withdraw its Securities
and Exchange Commission application for Vipers, and seeks an order declaring 
Vanguard liable for unspecified
damages and attorneys' fees. 

McGraw-Hill's complaint states that Vipers differ significantly from shares 
of the open-end mutual funds that
Vanguard offered under the 1988 agreement.

I appreciate the patience on the Password issue.   I realize it has been a 
while since we first spoke about this point. 

I have reviewed the concern about hackers and Enron use of Passwords and the 
best we can do is insert language into the Password App. similar to that 
appearing in the attached document (which is the same type of language used 
in the ETA's).  It is intended only to cover the situation where Clickpaper 
personnel use the password or otherwise access the website, in an 
unauthorized manner, on behalf of a counterparty.  The language does not 
address the hacker situation as we place the burden in that situation upon 
the counterparty.

Finally, since the Password App. is a legal, electronic agreement, any 
amendments or modifications for a counterparty must come through my office or 
through Tana Jones ((x. 33399).  Accordingly, those counterparties who have 
raised the issue should call either one of us if further action is 
necessary.  We do not actually revise the form agreements, but do provide 
side letters indicating modifications to the form agreement.

got your voice but it was a little late to call. I will call you tonight. But 
let me briefly cover the points you mentioned

On insurance I have faxed across our legal opinion on weather. We prepared a 
detailed discussion on insurance in a schedule. But the main point is that 
there is no  nexus between damage/loss suffered by a party and payments under 
the weather derivative. 
On access to data Christian Werner in Sydney is researching alternatives. I 
was proposing to forward details of these arrangements so they could be 
double checked by B &M.
Mark Taylor has been copied in on our documentation (GTCs and product 
description form) for Australian weather. We have also been working with Paul 
Simon, Edmund Cooper and Justin Boyd in London.  

Korea is becoming more of a possibility. Although not settled that we will be 
offering these products it is becoming more likely.  Hence we may have some 
work there.

All content for Phase 2 will be forwarded to Mark Taylor, Mark Palmer, John

You might consider treating the choice of law and submission to jurisdiction 
as two separate issues.  For example, if BC law is not objectionable, we 
could choose that law to apply but not consent to the jurisdiction of any 
particular court.  The most likely outcome (at least in many US states) would 
be that we would end up in a BC court if we had to sue them but unless we 
have significant contacts with BC (e.g. an office there) they would have to 
sue us in Alberta.

Lord himself. The Lord says
to the cat, ""You lived a good life and if there is anyway I can make your 
stay in Heaven more comfortable,
please let Me know.""

The cat thinks for a moment and says, ""Lord, all my life I have lived with a 
poor family and had to sleep
on a hard wooden floor.""

The Lord stops the cat and says, ""Say no more,"" and a wonderful fluffy 
pillow  appears.

A few days later six mice are killed in a tragic farming accident and go to 
Heaven. Again the Lord is
there to greet them with the same offer.  The mice answer, ""All of our lives 
we have been chased. We have
had to run from cats, dogs, and even women with brooms.  Running, running,  
running;  we're tired of running. Do
you think we could have roller skates so we don't have to run anymore?""

The Lord says, ""Say no more,"" and fits each mouse with beautiful new roller 
skates.

About a week later the Lord stops by to see the cat and finds him in a deep 
sleep on the pillow. The Lord
gently wakes the cat and asks him how was he doing. The cat replies better 
than I could have ever expected.

at the cruising guide when I got home last night to see where we might be 
able to poke around in the USVI.  I seem to remember that the Moorings won't 
let us take the boat to St. Croix (a bit far away) but had thought we might 
want to get special permission.  Now I'm not so sure if the place will still 
be all ahoo when we get there.  It might not have been the entire group's cup 
of tea in any event since it would take a good solid day of sailing each way 
to and from St. John.  My impression is that I might be the only soul on 
board who would relish that thought - particularly if the seas are still a 
bit rough from storm effects.  I'm watching the national Weather Service 
updates as they come out - roughly every two hours.

Caution on the Fed Ex package for the doorman - USVI may be the US for INS 
purposes but not for Fed Ex - they require an international waybill for 
deliveries there.  You can have the package sent to their Cruz Bay office to 
be held for pick-up (two day service - guaranteed by 4 pm) or to St. Thomas 
airport (next day service by 2 pm).  I mentioned in a previous note that the 
main harbor in St. Thomas is not really yacht friendly but we could probably 
figure out a way to get in there if that works out best (maybe go into a 
different bay, dinghy ashore and get a cab to the airport).  Fed Ex - (800)

solution last year to the ""cat climbing the Christmas tree"" problem except 
fastening the glass ornaments really tight so when she climbed up inside the 
tree they didn't shake off.  This year she seems content to just hide 
underneath the tree and hasn't been climbing up inside it - maybe she's just 
gotten too big.  I agree that the mouse traps sound mean - what about 
double-sided tape?  I understand the cats hate stepping on the sticky stuff 
so will leave the area alone afterwards (this was suggested as a 
discouragement to jumping on kitchen countertops but might work under the

I don't doubt that the PJM summary has improved, as I have been pulling the data directly from edata instead of using the website.  I will begin to record the difference and will talk with the web data folks in an attempt to understand where they are pulling the data.

I have been using the updated website.

I spot checked the Zone P prices and there were few errors of little consequence.

As for the NE physical, I was doing some analysis and unless I have my directions backwards 24to6 has been a pretty solid play. On the DAP to DAW and DAP to RTW.  DA to RT has even been a pretty decent play during other hours.  From the night shift I can't tell if this is not being scheduled because you are busy managing EOL products or if there is some reason I don't have the experience to understand yet.

I know this is your book and you will want to keep the earnings.  I just noticed the opportunity appears to be there.  If you would like we can do some of the analysis and pass it on to you to place the orders.  Another idea might be for you to tell us what you want to do in NY and you can decide what to do with it on the day shift.

I do not want to step on your turf.  At the same time,"" the times they are a changin'""  You have done well with the books you have and as people come and go it is easy to see a scenario where you will be trading more during the day.  As you move to use the NE physical book more for hedging, as Gautam has used it.  There may be a role for the 24 hour guys to take on more of the speculative portion of the physical market. It would seem to make sense to at least start getting the other guys thinking about that portion of the market by trying any of the ideas in the previous paragraph.

Dear Friends & Family,

Happy Thanksgiving!  We hope that all of you are able to spend quality time
with your loved ones over the long holiday weekend.

Sophie and I would like to inform you that we have recently moved to New
Orleans, Louisiana (NOLA), as of Labor Day weekend.  As many of you know,
our recent transition is a result of Sophie's admission into the Tulane
School of Medicine.  She is currently pursuing her life-long dream of
becoming a doctor and we are both very excited for this opportunity.

NOLA is a familiar environment for both of us; it's where we met nearly
four years ago.  We are still maintaining a partial residence in Houston
and try to visit family & friends at least once a month.  I am still based
out of the Accenture Houston Office and currently work on a project in
Atlanta during the week.  Although we will be a little further away from
all of you, we very much look forward to your visits.  And we're especially
happy to announce that we'll be able to entertain you in our new loft
(unless, of course, Med School exams are going on).

FERC acknowledges two problems with the AMP that the NYISO has already comm=

 the impact test, and exempting bids of less than 50 MW unless thee is a de=
monstrated  market power concern. In addition, FERC directs the ISO to work=
 with market participants to (1) examine whether the AMP may serve as a bar=
rier to entry for new generation, and whether such new generation should be=
 exempted from the AMP; (2) examine whether other energy limited resources,=
 including those constrained by environmental rules, should be exempted fro=
m or accommodated in the AMP. Currently, only hydro units are exempted beca=
use their volatile bids often reflect their opportunity costs, not market p=

erned here that that all the pieces may not fit together and there may be i=

 it encourages them to collaborate with PJM and ISO-NE in formulating its M=

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

He added, ""My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board.""",Ken Lay Ken,,Enron Board of Directors Board
1224,"We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop (stand alone computer).

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). ","David Oxley

1270,"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

12:24 16Aug2001 RSF-Canada blisters under ""year with too much summer""

    By Kanina Holmes
    WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canadians, sometimes divided by regional differences, economic disparities or linguistic snits, find themselves united this summer by an uncomfortable phenomenon -- a national drought.
    From Atlantic to Pacific, from the Arctic to the U.S. border, most of the world's second-largest country has been sweating through weeks of blistering heat that experts say could end up being the worst drought in decades.
    ""In many ways, this drought is the same tune that's being played right across the country. It's a different look, different season and different impact, but nevertheless, everybody has a water shortage problem in many parts of the country,"" said David Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada.
    Whether it's fires raging in the forests of British Columbia and Quebec, barren Prairie plains or harsh restrictions on water usage in Ontario, many will remember the summer of 2001.
    ""It'll be memorable for the wrong reasons I think. Too much excess and not enough normal,"" said Phillips.
    In parts of British Columbia, water management officials say the tinderbox conditions are largely the result of last winter's record low snowfall in the mountains.
    ""We've had normal summer in terms of rain. But we knew back in March with the low snowpack that if we had a normal summer we were going to be in trouble,"" said Jim Mattison, Water Management Director for B.C's Bureau of Sustainable Resources.
    But the devastation is most apparent in Canada's breadbasket, the Prairies. Many farmers, especially in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, have already written off their crops.
    ""I've been here since '63. I have never in my life, ever, seen anything like this,"" Norman Stienwand, a farmer in Castor, Alberta, told Reuters.
    ""IT'S BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION""
    ""There's no water. The grasshoppers are so bad. It's beyond your imagination,"" said Stienwand who farms 1,080 hectares (2,700 acres) of grains and oilseeds and also raises beef cattle.
    It has been so sweltering in his region, located about 160 km (100 miles) west of the Saskatchewan border, that some of Stienwand's farm machinery caught fire this week as he tried to bale a meager barley crop into hay for his livestock.
    ""It's just going to destroy a lot of farmers. They're just not going to come out of it,"" he said.
    In June, the Alberta government declared a drought disaster to trigger emergency aid to livestock farmers struggling to feed and water their herds, and, as many of the withered and patchy crops are harvested, many analysts are already anticipating sharp reductions in yields and quality.
    Last week, the Canadian Wheat Board, the marketer of western Canada's wheat, durum and barley crops, forecast a 10 to 15 percent decline in exports.
    In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, prime agricultural areas have received only about 15 percent of the precipitation they would normally see.
    ""You wouldn't be able to fill a sardine can with the rain they've got since the twenty-second of June,"" said Phillips.
    The drought has created ideal conditions for billions of Asian aphids to infest Ontario's soybean crop.
    ""I drive by and actually now I just shut my eyes and pretend I don't see it. It's just really, really, really dry,"" said Debbie Yuck, a farmer who lives near Ottawa and who has watched her corn whither and yellow over the past few weeks.
    ""When they come on (the radio) every morning and say it's a beautiful sunny day, great to be at the cottage, I think a beautiful day would a good downpour for about 16 hours,"" said Yuck.
    Canada's largest city, Toronto, has experienced a record number of days with health alerts because of the heat and smog, with temperatures soaring as high as 37 C (99 F). Some Ontario residents now face fines for watering their yards.
    An Ontario woman was recently charged for dropping incendiary material near a forest after she threw her lit cigarette butt on a road in front of a police officer.
    ""THE YEAR WITH TOO MUCH SUMMER""
    ""I wish I could come up with a word that would describe the misery and the hardship that urban and rural folk are feeling,"" said Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada who tracks national weather patters.
    ""I would describe it maybe as the year with too much summer.""
    The hot, dry spell could be a blow to the national economy. By the time the final bill is tallied for lost crops, aiding farmers, battling forest fires and generating more electricity, it could run into the billions.
    Quebec's multibillion-dollar agricultural sector, which accounts for some 16 percent of the Canadian industry's revenues and produces 38 percent of the country's milk, has also been hard hit since early July.
    In southern Quebec, where it has not rained for five weeks despite bouts of high heat and humidity, vegetable farmers have been working around the clock to save sun-ravaged crops.
    ""The farmers are on the edge of burn-out, they can barely stand up,"" said David St-Cyr, a spokesman for Quebec's powerful Agricultural Union.
    The Atlantic provinces have also been caught in the oppressive heat, the result of massive high pressure systems in the United States that, for weeks, have blocked the circulation of other weather patterns trying to make their way north.
    Clouds of red dust follow behind potato producers working the parched fields on Prince Edward Island, growers who may lose 25 percent of their crop. Blueberries in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have shriveled to look like raisins.
    ""I think there are a majority of Canadians, probably, who can hardly wait for the winter. And I never thought I'd ever hear that,"" said Phillips.

Brookhaven Energy Project Permit Application Ruled Complete by
New York State Regulators

(London - 17 August 2001) International Power plc, one of the world's
leading independent power producers, today announces that the New York State
Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment has accepted as
complete its application to build the Brookhaven Energy Project on Long
Island. The Siting Board's decision marks the beginning of the State's
formal review process, and is a key regulatory milestone for the 580-
megawatt natural gas fired electric generating facility. The ruling kicks-
off a yearlong review process that will involve public hearings.

International Power submitted the application for their proposed energy
facility with the Siting Board, as required under Article X of the State of
New York Public Service Law, on June 25, 2001. This application, which the
State ruled as meeting the minimum requirements for compliance, addresses
all of the pertinent environmental and siting issues of the project,
including its design, location, fuel use, and air and water quality.

""The New York Siting Board's ruling puts us a step closer to providing Long
Island with a clean and affordable new source of electric power,"" said Peter
Giller, International Power's Chief Executive Officer. ""We are planning to
begin construction of Brookhaven in the third quarter of next year and
expect to have the plant in service by the end of 2004,"" he added.

Notes to Editors-

The Brookhaven Energy project is proposed for development on 28 acres of
industrially zoned land just south of the Long Island Expressway at exit 66
and along the southeast corner of Sills Road in the Town of Brookhaven. When
completed, the plant will provide enough energy to power over half a million
homes. The project will also result in additional significant benefits to
the region, including job creation and substantial tax benefits.

International Power plc is one of the world's leading independent electric
generating companies with over 8,850 MW (net) in operation, 2,350 MW (net)
under construction and approximately 8,000 MW (net) in advanced development.
Among the countries where International Power has operating facilities are
Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic,
Portugal, Turkey, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand. International Power was
created from the demerger of National Power, and its shares began trading
independently on the London Stock Exchange and as ADRs on the New York Stock
Exchange on 2 October 2000. The ticker symbol on both stock exchanges
is ""IPR"".

13:39 20Aug2001 RSF-ANALYSIS-Brazil energy diet slims utilities' accounts

    By Andrei Khalip
    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The latest corporate results by Brazilian power utilities provided only a glimpse of the impact of energy rationing that started in June, but enough for analysts to say the sector is probably the most hard-hit by Brazil's economic woes.
    Coupled with a sharp depreciation of the real currency, which has lost about one-fourth of its dollar value so far this year, and an overall economic slowdown, power rationing should hammer energy companies further in coming months.
    ""Although the currency's depreciation was the main culprit of poor results in the second quarter and first half, power rationing has already shown its face,"" said Oswaldo Telles, power sector analyst with BBV Securities.
    ""And it will get worse for power utilities this quarter.""
    The government was forced to resort to tough power rationing in June, ordering Brazilians to knock 20 percent off their usual power consumption, in order to avert crippling blackouts amid an acute power shortage.
    Brazil is dependent on hydroelectric plants for over 90 percent of its electricity. Two years of drought and full use of power stations' capacity to feed a growing economy dried up reservoir levels and triggered the worst energy crisis in at least 30 years in Latin America's largest country.
    Rationing, due to last at least until November, means lower sales and revenues for power firms, while their costs and dollar-denominated debt get inflated by the real's losses.
    ""It's only the beginning of rationing, but it gives us an idea of how power utilities, distributors in particular, will be affected,"" said Eduardo de la Pena of Banco Santander. ""I think we can say that they are suffering the most.""
    Out of electricity sector stocks, most analysts only have a buy recommendation for Copel <CPLE3.SA> of southern Parana state, where there is no energy shortage and no rationing.
    GOVERNMENT HELP SOUGHT
    Among the big losers in the past six months were Sao Paulo's Cesp <CESP4.SA> utility whose losses rose sharply and   Eletropaulo <ELPL4.SA>, controlled by US-based AES Corp. <AES.N>, which posted a net loss after a year-ago profit.
    Rio de Janeiro's power distributor Light <LIGH3.SA> last week posted its biggest half-year loss ever of 431 million reais ($172 million) and Light officials said the company should suffer big losses this year with revenues falling at least 10 percent due to the rationing program.
    The main problem for companies is that the government fixes electricity prices in Brazil -- even though most distributors had long been privatized -- and allows the adjustments to compensate for higher costs only once a year.
    ""This year, their costs grew so violently that when the adjustments came it was about time to adjust tariffs again,"" said Telles. ""But they just have to wait till next year.
    Analysts said the only bright spot may be that the government will allow companies to start adjusting tariffs twice in one year. There are rumors of such a change although analysts recognize such an unpopular measure would be difficult in the run-up to presidential elections next year.
   In an ironic twist, power distributors are now spending money on lawyers to defend in court the government's order for power switchoffs for quota-busters -- the measure that effectively slashes their revenues.
    In the meantime, the companies are banking on an obscure contractual clause, known as Annex V, that should compensate them for lost revenue due to rationing. Some have even booked that gain in the latest results, although the government has so far not confirmed that it will pay.
    ""Annex V is the biggest question for power firms. If there is no compensation, they are screwed,"" said another analyst.

14:54 20Aug2001 RSF-Quebecers should have own citizenship - report

    By Marianne White
    QUEBEC CITY, Aug. 20 (Reuters) - In order to reaffirm the ""precarious"" status of French in North America, Quebecers should have their own citizenship, a provincial task force studying the status of the French language reported on Monday.
    But Quebecers would not get a new passport or be asked to choose between Quebec or Canadian citizenship, the report added.
    The goal is to make everyone, including new immigrants, English-speaking residents and native peoples, feel that they are part of Quebec, a French-speaking island in an English-dominated North America.
    ""We want to do that in a way in which people know that linguistic policy is a fundamental characteristic of this society,"" said the chairman of the task force, Gerald Larose, a trade unionist who favors Quebec's separation from Canada.
    ""As far as language is concerned, living in Quebec is not like living in Canada,"" Larose added.
    The Quebec government reacted with caution to the recommendation of Quebec citizenship, saying on Monday that it shared the ideals that underlie the recommendation.
    ""We do need to have a welcoming ritual for immigrants in order to send a clear message,"" said Diane Lemieux, minister responsible for the French language, adding that the government would undertake an update of its language policy.
    The language task force, which crisscrossed the predominantly French-speaking province, which is three times the size of France, over the past 12 months, unveiled 149 recommendations on Monday.
    It urged the Quebec government to ask for full control over immigration to ensure new arrivals will learn French, a recommendation that is not likely to please the federal government which controls immigration in conjunction with provincial governments.
    The report also recommends a provincial exam for all new teachers to test their fluency in French, and says that if they fail they should not be hired. It also proposes increasing teaching hours for French, delaying the introduction of English teaching in schools by several years, and protecting the rights of Quebecers to work in French.
    About 82 percent of Quebec's six million people describe French is their mother tongue. French has been Quebec's official language since 1974 and by law must dominate commercial signs, although other languages may also appear. Quebec has 1.4 million people whose first language is not French.
    Language can be an emotional and divisive issue in Quebec, which has held two referendums on separating from Canada. In the last one, in 1995, Quebecers voted to remain in Canada only by a razor-thin margin.
    English and French have been Canada's two official languages since 1969, with both languages spoken widely throughout the nation's history

1309,"Well Aaron,
It is great to hear that you are doing well.  

Yes, Raquel and I ( the same gal I was dating at Genesis) ended up tying the knot in late April in Rio.  We got married in small church on the Lagoa, quite a beautiful place to get married.  Above the church sat the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer looking down on us.  My parents, family and friends attended and I know what you mean by fish out of the water!

We bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood.   I too have learned a lot about fixing up homes, it is something that I have actually begun to enjoy.  The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank.  We are now considering paying it off, however I am not sure for how much longer we will live there. Therefore, not sure if we really want to pay it off.  

As far as children go, we are still waiting for the right time.  I imagine we will have one in a year or so... right now we are enjoying taking vacations on a whim.  Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for week and 1/2 due to the terrorist attacks.  Not such a bad place to be stuck.  I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there.  It is different from most great cities in the world.  For example Paris, Rome, London, NYC are all famous for the great buildings, etc... however, Rio is one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see (as far as a city settings go).  The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the white sand beaches and blue sea.  It is the cidade maravillosa!!! 


Take care and have a great Christmas.

Paul

 A REPUBLICAN: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none.
 So what?

 A DEMOCRAT: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none.
 You feel guilty for being successful. You vote people
 into office who tax your cows, forcing you to sell one
 to raise money to pay the tax. The people you voted for
 then take the tax money and buy a cow and give it to
 your neighbor. You feel righteous.

 A SOCIALIST: You have two cows. The government takes one
 and gives it to your neighbor.

 A COMMUNIST: You have two cows. The government seizes
 both and provides you with milk.

 A FASCIST: You have two cows. The government seizes both
 and sells you the milk. You join the underground and
 start a campaign of sabotage.

 DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The
 government taxes you to the point you have to sell both
 to support a man in a foreign country who has only one
 cow, which was a gift from your government.

 CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. You sell
 one, buy a bull, and build a herd of cows.

 BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The
 government takes them both, shoots one, milks the other,
 pays you for the milk, then pours the milk down the
 drain.

 AN AMERICAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You sell
 one, and force the other to produce the milk of four
 cows. You are surprised when the cow drops dead.

 A FRENCH CORPORATION: You have two cows. You go on
 strike because you want three cows.

 A JAPANESE CORPORATION: You have two cows. You redesign
 them so they are one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow
 and produce twenty times the milk.

 A GERMAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You re-engineer
 them so they live for 100 years, eat once a month, and
 milk themselves.

 AN ITALIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows, but you don't
 know where they are. You break for lunch.

 A RUSSIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You count them
 and learn you have five cows. You count them again and
 learn you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn
 you have 12 cows. You stop counting cows and open
 another bottle of vodka.

 A MEXICAN CORPORATION: You think you have two cows, but
 you don't know what a cow looks like. You take a nap.

 A SWISS CORPORATION: You have 5000 cows, none of which
 belongs to you. You charge for storing them for others.

 A BRAZILIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You enter
 into a partnership with an American corporation. Soon
 you have 1000 cows and the American corporation declares
 bankruptcy.

 AN INDIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You worship
 them.

Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)... and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded... they hold 35,000/day in 2003. Combined this is almost half of the planned expansion. 

Although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately I believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together. As you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211,000 / day is made up 2 shippers Calpine 35,000/day and Newport Gen 175,000/day and this expansion has it's own issues.  

As we know more about shippers moving around I will pass on... pls do same.

1356,"Just to let you know, sort of a ""heads up"", that I have also invited Dave 
Plumb
to the meeting this Friday.  I hope you can understand that I must follow
protocol here.  I suspect out past unsuccessful negotiations may be a topic of
discussion for him, however, I do not know this for a fact.

I told him you two were in the Valley making your Spring customer calls and 
Mesa
was slated for approximately 10:30 a.m. until noon+(?) with lunch included.  I
thought we would go up the street to Rigatony's.  Sound good??

Dave, this might be an opportunity for you to ask any questions regarding the
electric RFP.  I don't know the results or if they have even made a decision
yet.

Hopefully we can talk about where we have been, where we are now, and what the
future looks like.  Also the possibilities and potential for continued 
business.

Looking forward to seeing and visiting with both of you this Friday.

CalPeak was formed less than two months ago, and has no financials.

We will provide a pro forma balance sheet should the bidder be selected.

Types of typical project support are things like a UT gurantee for one
month's fuel supply, etc.

1363,"The answer about environmentalist making it hard to build power plants in california is YES.   Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.  They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.

Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.  Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.  Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.  The light WILL go out in Cali!!!!

1364,"Hey Guys - A couple of follow up items from yesterday's meeting to update you on.

Affiliates - Transwestern still has the same affiliates as we did prior to Enron's declaration of bankruptcy.  No changes.

Pooling - I spoke with Perry Frazier today to consider whether TW would gain any capacity if it were to do away with pooling.  This is really a moving target because we don't know the exact receipt point of all the gas with a receipt pool on its contract, but Perry will discuss this with his team and let us know.
