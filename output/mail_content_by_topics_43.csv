but that might still be possible.  Anyway, let's see what happens with the
variance.  I appreciate your efforts.

By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors?

One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold 
front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In 
such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how 
Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures 
were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, 
and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position 
currently.  But in the winter that may change.
Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the 
assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter 
the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long 
cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side.   
While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the 
payout probabilities may look like the following:

20%  $ -.05
40%     $ -.02
20% $ 0
19% $ .03
1% $ 1

4,"johnny hope all is well. is ok here. new york a little stranger than normal
for obvious reasons.. wwe're trying to get back to normal. pretty stressful
cupla weeks. business has been pretty good(trading anyway) in natgas and
oil. certainly have been some changes in natgas fundamentals but too littl
too late im afraid to get bullish . market sucks and the newest shock to
macr economics im starting to think are mitigating what mite have been some
postive bullish changes like gas/oil relationship and gas shut ins. looks
shitty i think. im not as short as ive been but starting to think this witer
is waaay too high priced. just funtction timing i guess. i sold a few march
aprils again. just doesnt fit the curve and i think 80% probabitly we end
march with over 1.3 tcf in the ground. wud keep things ugle for awhile.
  anyway curious your thots as always. also wanted to say hi.have a good
weekend"

10,do you mind if i go out with the boys from work tonight?
11,"very funny today...during the free fall, couldn't price jv and xh low enough 
on eol, just kept getting cracked.  when we stabilized, customers came in to 
buy and couldnt price it high enough.  winter versus apr went from +23 cents 
when we were at the bottom to +27 when april rallied at the end even though 
it should have tightened theoretically.  however, april is being supported 
just off the strip.  getting word a lot of utilities are going in front of 
the puc trying to get approval for hedging programs this year.  




"
12,"We've started breaking out separate P&L's.  It's been a very difficult 
process so far for a number of reasons.  The last processes will be 
separating out the P&L on the executive reports and on VAR. That will happen 
this week.  Meanwhile, the P&L will be retroactive to the start of the year 
and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero 
or an adjustment will be made to get it there.   At the end of the year there 
will be a number next to Maggi's name that he will not dispute.  His 
contribution to the fixed side when I'm on vacations or in meetings will 
continue to be a subjective process.

cheating.  You are supposed to have at least one player on IR each week.  A 
designated IR player cannot play.  There are no IR moves during the week.  
That means that at least one person on your team should score no points each

Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 01/08/02
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Bettis will play in the team's Divisional Playoff Game in two weeks. ""There's no question about the next game,"" Bettis said, ""I'll be fine."" Bettis missed Pittsburgh's final five games of the year due to a groin injury, but seems to have healed sufficiently enough to get back into the starting lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to Phillynews.com, Buckhalter will see an increase in playing time behind starter Duce Staley on Saturday against Tampa Bay. Buckhalter, who ran for 89 yards against the Bucs on Sunday night, may even find himself in the same backfield as Staley in certain sets. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 01/08/02
Starting tailback Charlie Garner is a bit banged up, so Wheatley could see some additional carries on Saturday against the N.Y. Jets. ""He gave us some pop inside, inside the five (-yard line),"" Head Coach Jon Gruden told the Contra Costa Times . ""The physical finish that allowed us to score a touchdown early in the game was vintage Tyrone Wheatley. No question, we'd like to see a heavier dose of the big man as the playoffs begin."" Garner is expected to start, but Wheatley will likely get a majority of the short-yard and goal-line carries. 

Bills <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=4&>, DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Defensive end Phil Hansen announced his retirement from football this week. ""My body and my heart tell me it's time to move on. I've known for a long time now that this would be my final season. I tried to keep it a secret because I didn't want it to become a distraction to any of my teammates,"" Hansen told the Boston Globe . Hansen started his career by making three straight Super Bowl appearances, but he ended his 11-year tenure one day after the Bills worst season (3-13) since 1985.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 01/08/02
Gadsden, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo with a hamstring injury, will start on Sunday against Baltimore. However, he may be hard pressed to up good numbers against the Ravens' tough secondary. 

Dolphins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=15&>, DT MIA - Martin Updated 01/08/02
Linebacker Zach Thomas missed Sunday's game against Buffalo because of muscle spasms in his neck and pain from a muscle strain in his shoulder. ""I won't be [sitting out] this week,"" Thomas told the Miami Herald. Thomas said he would have played if it were a playoff game, but he sat out so he wouldn't worsen the injuries for the postseason. 

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Chambers suffered a sprained right ankle during Sunday's win over Buffalo. The rookie now has sprains in both of his ankles, and was removed from the game as a precaution. However, Chambers is expected to play in Sunday's game against Baltimore. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 01/08/02
Freeman is nursing sore ribs, but he is expected to play on Sunday against San Francisco. The veteran wideout finished the regular season with 52 catches for 818 yards and five touchdowns. 

D'Wayne Bates <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=133222&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Bates could remain the No. 2 receiver for Chicago even if Dez White returns from a hamstring injury. ""It's something we'll have to look at,"" Coach Dick Jauron said. ""Hopefully Dez will be back and ready to play, and then we'll! s! ee where he is. Dez has done a real nice job for us, and D'Wayne has certainly stepped up and played really well."" Bates has been productive in White's absence, posting 157 yards receiving over the past two games. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 01/08/02
Brookins returned from a foot injury on Monday night against Minnesota. He carried the ball seven times for 15 yards, and is expected to see an increase in his carries next Sunday against Miami. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 01/08/02
Janikowski will be available for Saturday's Wild Card Game against the N.Y. Jets. He had been dealing with a bout of cellulitis in his foot, but seems to have healed sufficiently after missing the team's regular season finale. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks. 

Seahawks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Corner! ba! ck Shawn Springs started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. ""If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week,"" Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 

Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1296&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards and one touchdown. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 01/07/02
Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta, and has been told not to talk for a week. ""They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine,"" Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. ""They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords,"" Warner said. ""It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit."" Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 01/07/02
Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
McNair missed the second half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to back spasms. The injury isn't considered serious. McNair had an outstanding season, finishing with 3,350 yards passing and 26 total touchdowns. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week. 

Charlie Garner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 01/07/02
Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 01/07/02
Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks. 

Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 01/07/02
Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year. 

Terry Glenn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 01/07/02
Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had to attend to a personal matter. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 01/07/02
Horn left Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. He caught three passes for 44 yards before suffering the injury, and finished the season with 83 catches for 1,265 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns. 

Cris Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 01/07/02
Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 01/07/02
Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season. Furth! er! tests are expected to be taken this week. 

Mike Hollis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1387&>, K JAC - Giggles Updated 01/07/02
Hollis was benched late in Sunday's game against Chicago after having a first-quarter field goal blocked and later missing his second extra point of the season. Hollis, who is now an unrestricted free agent, is not expected to return to the Jaguars for the 2002 season. 

Marcus Pollard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Pollard left Sunday's game against Denver in the third quarter with a sprained left knee. He finished the contest with two catches for 11 yards in the Colts' 29-10 victory. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 01/07/02
Stewart (ankle) played in Sunday's game against Dallas after being listed as questionable for most of the week. The veteran tailback rushed for 69 yards in Detroit's 15-10 win. 

Terrell Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 01/07/02
According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. ""I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know,"" Davis said. ""I want to be here. I think we'll find a happy medium for both sides. It will be a win-win situation, I believe."" Davis is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent.

Jason Elam <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1383&>, K DEN - Martin Updated 01/07/02
According to the Rocky Mountain News, Elam has about a 50-50 chance of returning to Denver next season. ""I've met every goal that I had coming into the season,"" Elam said. ""I'm very happy with the individual season I had. I just wish the team could have gotten better."" Elam is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.

on in the next 3-4 years as well as a report that shows current generation.  
The names of the companies building/owning the facilities is not important.  
The most important data is MW capacity as well as type of generation (i.e.,

Do you have this information?

 Latest NFL Player News 

 KaRon Coleman , RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/04/00 
 Coleman has been ruled out of                    Sunday's game because of an 
ankle injury.  Mike Anderson will back up Terrell Davis and see most, if not 
all relief work that is available.  

 Robert Chancey , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Chancey has faded from view as a Fantasy player. The Chargers appear to be 
more comfortable with Terrell Fletcher and Jermaine Fazande as featured 
runners.  

 Curtis Conway , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 11/03/00 
 Conway might have a big day at Seattle. The Chargers will surely move him 
around and send him deep in an effort to keep the vulnerable Seahawks' 
secondary off balance.  
 Jeff Graham , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 11/03/00 
 Graham has been mostly quiet during the month of October. The Chargers seem 
to be more dependent on Freddie Jones and are waiting for Curtis Conway to 
develop some consistency.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Jones could approach 100 receiving yards at Seattle. The Seahawks do not 
have the bulk necessary at MLB or at the safeties to contain him.   

 Jermaine Fazande , RB SD - Murder Inc. Updated 11/03/00 
 Fazande might be a sleeper selection this week. He always gives Seattle's 
LBs problems with his strength and tenacity.   

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 The Chargers have the personnel to defuse Seattle this week. The secondary 
will pounce on Jon Kitna's mistakes and the front seven will swarm all over 
Ricky Watters and Shaun Alexander.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 John Carney has made his last 10 field goal attempts against the Seahawks. 
Expect him to roll up more good numbers against them this week.  

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 The Seahawks have been crippled by an apparent choice to play zone 
coverages. Opponents simply avoid Shawn Springs and light up the other DBs. 
Jim Harbaugh is sure to follow the opposing blueprint for success this week.  
 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Lindell has shown some flashes of brilliance as Seattle's kicker, but the 
Seahawks' offense is hindering his productivity.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/03/00 
 Dawkins has been showing some signs of life recently. The Seahawks need him 
to go over the middle more if they want to establish continuity on offense.  

 Derrick Mayes , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Mayes will make his return to the starting lineup this week. Rookie Darrell 
Jackson has been demoted to the No. 3 WR spot.  

 Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/03/00 
 Ricky Watters has been pronounced fit to start this week. Alexander should 
see some carries in relief, though.  

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Kitna will start again this week as the Seahawks take on the Chargers, who 
have a vulnerable, but opportunistic secondary.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Peterson has quickly proved he is still a reliable kicker. The Chiefs will 
give him consistent opportunties to score this year.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Mean Machine Updated 11/03/00 
 Janikowski is finally living up to his billing after a rough start. The 
Raiders will give him plenty of opportunities to score against the Chiefs 
this week.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 11/03/00 
 Richardson is still seeing some carries and remains an occasional passing 
target. He is worth a reserve spot on rosters in larger leagues.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/03/00 
 Anders is showing signs of becoming a reliable Fantasy runner. He may still 
give away some carries in goal-line packages, though.  

 Rickey Dudley , TE OAK - Risk Managers Updated 11/03/00 
 Dudley has become a Fantasy non-factor. Don't expect much from him against 
an aggressive Kansas City defense.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - FDIC Updated 11/03/00 
 Gonzalez has always played well against Oakland. Expect him to find the end 
zone at least once on Sunday.  

 James Jett , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Jett's starting job might be about to slip away. Oakland is simply waiting 
for Andre Rison to have a breakthrough game as a Raider.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Brown usually comes up big in AFC West contests. Look for him to terrorize 
the Chiefs this week.  

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Fear Updated 11/03/00 
 The Chiefs usually have trouble containing Gannon. Look for KC to play a 
containment style of defense rather than risk getting burned on blitzes.   

 Ed McCaffrey , WR DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 McCaffrey could have a good game against the Jets. Brian Griese will look to 
take pressure off a returning Terrell Davis by utilizing the passing game 
early.  

 Rod Smith , WR DEN - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Smith is a good play this week. He will use his height to outmanuever the 
Jets' cornerbacks.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 Elam's efficiency will be tested by the swirling winds in New Jersey this 
week. The Meadowlands will present him with a stiff challenge.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 Carswell has become less of a factor in the passing game. He still may score 
occasionally in goal-line packages.  

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 The Broncos will be severely tested by the Jets' passing game this week. 
Vinny Testaverde has been sacked only seven times this season.  

 Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/03/00 
 Anderson will operate as the No. 2 RB behind Terrell Davis this week, but 
should still see some carries as a change-of-pace back.  

 Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/03/00 
 Jackson has lost his starting spot. Derrick Mayes appears healthy for the 
first time this year and will start opposite Sean Dawkins against San Diego.

comments all the time.

43,"We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=

the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=

I'm pretty sure that I saw your name on my calendar sometime this week to 
talk about Glenn Surowiec, but then it disappeared.  I would be happy to let 
you know how he's done (he was pre-ranked in Superior at EBS, so I imagine 
you're going to need some ammunition.)  Since I will be in the meeting as

66,"I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you 
know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources 
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to ""catch up"", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going 
basis.   

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS 
as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production 
support will be managed and how development work will be effectively 
handled.  

I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible.  "

 "
78,"Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

With the Dynegy announcement on November 9th, the U.S Trustee's office removed Enron from the PG&E Official Unsecured Creditor's Committee.  Dynegy is already on the Committee.    

Important hearings in the PG&E bankruptcy are scheduled for December.   These hearings should begin to vet the issue of preemption, or the ability of the federal bankruptcy court to preempt state law under the bankruptcy code, thus freezing out the CPUC from ruling on the transfer of PG&E's generating assets to FERC jurisdiction. 

We continue settlement discussions PG & E.   Including offsets in our trading contracts, our net nominal exposure to PG&E is $511 million.    The claim is disputed primarily due to the pending FERC refund case.       In initial discussions, Enron offered a $85 million discount.    PG&E has countered with a $237 million discount, a $152 million gap.  We are meeting with the company in an attempt to narrow the difference.

Southern California Edison (SCE) has broken off settlement negotiations.   The are forwarding a position that the Direct Access customers should pay a share of the IOU's undercollection, even though many Direct Access customers were sourcing their power via ESP's at that time.    Enron Government Affairs believes that the CPUC is behind SCE's position.   This regulatory scheme would have Enron owing SCE money on a net basis.

The Power Exchange (PX) Bankruptcy continues.   Enron has taken a visible role on the PC Official Unsecured Creditors Committee.     A liquidating plan in the bankruptcy should be filed shortly.

106,"After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger 
Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to 
resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His 
message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that 
he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this 
matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his 
supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we 
could choose this avenue if we desired. 

Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259."
107,"Well, I would suggest that you include some example of potential activities 
(not limited to them only, but they are possibly representatives of the types 
of activities that the RMEF could expect.  These might include:  the use of 
heavy equipment (e.g., bulldozer, road grader, backhoe, etc) to do dirt work 
or relocate materials from one place to another; to use volunteer field 
employees to  perform agreed to work on RMEF projects (e.g., fence building 
and/or repair, demolish any old structures, buildings, corrals, loading pens, 
feeding and/or watering stations, etc.); to plant wildlife feed plots, etc.  
Of course, all of this type work would only be done if both parties to the 
agreement had agreed as to the type of work, timing, expense, etc.  ETS will 
provide supplies and materials needed for all projects that are agreed to by 
both (unless a third party has already agreed to provide the supplies 
needed).  You could also add that ETS would consider the funding of certain 
auction items for local chapter banquets and/or purchase a table at such 
local banquets where we have employees that will attend.  

If this kind of detail is not what he is looking for, then we might have a 
serious problem in going forward.  If he is looking for specific details of a 
project - then you will have to wait until you get a team ready to offer a 
project to the RMEF for their specific consideration.  However, that will not 
be the overall umbrella agreement that I would like to get in place.

Let me know if this is a problem.  John

 "
108,"Jon and Ruth, presented below are the comments to the air perimts at 3 and 
4.  Please review for clairty and content.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn about 
all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No. 2.  
He is checking on what the EPA can do about this.  I have spoken to Arnold 
Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement for NOx 
and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by doing some 
major gas recycling.  This is a fuel waste and costly.  Anyway, depending 
upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably 
determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40 ppmvd.  Id 
like your comments asap.


          1.  The responsible official name change to  Danny Pribble.

                         2.. The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 
25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of 
startup   and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these 
rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE   data 
indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load 
conditions of 60%and lower.

 The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of 
the time with reduced load operations (64% load) occurring  no more than 20% 
of the time.  The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in 
the application in units of lb.hr and ton/yr.  These values were accepted by 
the EPA for the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the 
EPA (See EPA Statement  of Basis document).  Because the permit conditions 
hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is   
concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of 
NOx and CO would be 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is  requesting that  a provision 
be made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 
ppmvd during the 20 % of  the time that the turbines operating conditions is 
less than or equal to 60%.

3. The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern 
to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not     normally 
used to monitor and measure sulfur in the natural gas.  Transwestern has 
received approval from the EPA for other custom  fuel monitoring schedules to 
use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the 
proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas.

  "
109,"Shudeish, I spoke with Roger Kohn, Region IX EPA permit engineer, about the 
time his agency will take to do the air permit reveiw for Kingman and 
Flagstaff.  He stated that EPA normally gets the allowed 45 days to do the 
permit review, however, at the request of the state agency, his office will 
do an expidited review.  Because of the urgency of Transwetern desiring to 
initiate construction, by this email, I am asking the ADEQ to request  an 
expidited review  of the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits from the EPA.

Again, thanks for your work and effort that you have put in on this project."

119,"A meeting was held at C/S 6, Laguna on Tuesday November 16th, to reintroduce 
the pueblo of Laguna to Transwestern's environmental activities at the 
facility.  The Laguna's have hired an environmental person to oversee 
environmental issues on pueblo lands.  The meeting centered around three 
issues:  a UST site which had been removed, but not formally closed, a 
historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the 
late 1980's, and the ongoing groundwater remediation at  the site.  

Transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why 
these issues were unresolved in the ""eyes"" of the Laguna.  Transwestern 
committed to submitting closure requests for the UST and asbestos issues.  
With repsect to the groundwater issue, a presentation was given enlighting 
the Laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology 
and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants 
(chlorinated solvents and PCB's) and Transwestern's intent to continue its 
remediation efforts. Transwestern assured the Laguna environmental 
representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental 
issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency.   At the conclusion of the 
meeting, the Laguna's understood Transwestern's commitment to maintaining the 
policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of Laguna.

The meeting provided Transwestern and the Laguna's with the opportunity to 
meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships.  The 
Laguna's now have an understanding of the environmental activities at the 
site and what Transwestern's approach is to removing the contaminants.   The 
Laguna's appreciated Transwestern's efforts and commitment to environmental 
compliance on the Laguna pueblo."

121,"We have received written approval from both the OCD and the NMED for the soil 
characterization plan that was submitted for sampling soil in the former 
surface impoundment area located at the northeast corner of the facility. A 
work plan for excavation and disposal of affected soil will be prepared 
subsequent to completion of the soil characterization plan. A tentative 
schedule is as follows:
? Meet with the Team and the contractor (Gandy) at the site on August 29th
? Collect soil samples for characterization on September 5th and 6th. Bill 
Olson with the OCD has indicated that he would like to be present for these 
activities.
? Receive lab results by September 21st
? Submit excavation work plan by October 5th

Whether or not we can complete the excavation work this year will be largely 
dependent upon obtaining a quick approval of an excavation work plan. The 
timing will be tight but it can be done.

agreement.

Earl: Prepare a new work order for $3,000,000 naming specific sites and costs 
related to sampling and analysis.

Note: I have requested an additional $3,000,000 for this years Capital Plan 
to do this work, which Bill has received verbally from Stan. 

2. PG&E will lift the 250 / D limit and move to market driven conditions of 
up to 300 / D at Topock on May 15 with on-going monitoring to ensure no 
further migration of PCB's. They wish for a six month test on this condition.

Im having a hard time getting a response from the teams in the Midland Region 
in completing the attached EOTT tank spreadsheet.  Ive heard from some of the 
teams but nothing from others.  Im under the gun as to finding  out where the 
MIdland Region is in term of permits and and environmental compliance and the 
only way I can begin to make the evaluation is to have the field data inputed 
onto the spreadsheet.  This is where the teams assistance is required.  I 
have attached the latest version of the spreadsheet in the hope that you will 
deliver it to the following teams for their valued input:

141," Just to follow up, did you send a letter to Van Ryn at Koch re the 
hydrocarbon and mercury contaminations?  If so, could you please send me a 
copy?

 Also, have you been able to come up with any further info on what to do 
about the other soil contamination areas?  Do you still want to determine the 
full lateral and vertical extent of all?  FYI, I have made further inquiry as 
to whether we have any reporting or investigatory duties based upon the 
levels in the WZI report.  I believe the numbers you cited in you 5/21 email 
may be only part of the story: as you have appropriately noted, in California 
it is not only concentration levels that matter; rather, other variables such 
as depth to groundwater, proximity to population centers, etc. determine 
whether any reporting or remedial (including further investigatory) 
obligations arise.  Therefore, I'm checking further to see how these other 
variable impact our legal obligations here.  (Again, I think this is very 
important inour case because we want to be careful about potenially 
jeopardizing our indemnity rights against Koch by performing any Phase 
II-type activities where not legally required.

 I expect to have more info on this by the end of the week.  Perhaps we can 
chat then?  Thanks. --ETA

144,"Soil sampling for waste characterization was completed on September 6th. Bill 
Olson with the NMOCD was on-site to observe the sampling activities. 
Twenty-two soil samples were collected from the two former pit areas. Lab 
results indicate that the impacted soil samples do not trigger RCRA hazardous 
waste criteria, more specifically:
? for all 22 samples, all TCLP VOC constituents were non-detect
? for all 22 samples, all TCLP SVOC constituents were non-detect
? for all 22 samples, all TCLP Metal constituents were non-detect with only 
two exceptions. Arsenic was detected in the TCLP extract for two samples; one 
at 1.41 mg/L and another at 2.18 mg/L, both below the RCRA regulatory limit 
of 5.0 mg/L.
? for all 22 samples, the samples were determined to be ""not-ignitable""
? for all 22 samples, reactive cyanide and reactive sulfide were non-detect 
with only one exception. Reactive sulfide was detected for one sample at 160 
mg/kg; this is below the guidance level of 500 mg/kg.
? the measured pH for all samples was in the range of 6.9 - 9.1; this is 
within the RCRA regulatory limits of 2.0 - 12.5.

Furthermore, the measured TPH for all samples was in the range of 131 - 9660 
mg/kg with an average TPH concentration of 2429 mg/kg.

Selected photos of the sampling effort are attached. There was a considerable 
amount of waste debris found in the pits, particulary at the east end of the 
larger pit area.

I will be finalizing the excavation plan for the former pit areas over the 
next week or so. I will prepare cost estimates for two alternative excavation 
plans; one for a dig and haul option and one for a combination of dig and 
haul for the most heavily affected soil and on-site blending for less 
affected soil. We should try to have a work plan to the NMOCD by the week of 
October 1st.

161,"Alert Posted: 12:30 PM November 18, 2000: Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Monday, November 20, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pools.
ATLANTA, MACON, AUGUSTA , and ROME
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.

164,"I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to 
submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency 
originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the 
TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the 
emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are 
the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 
inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 
tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would 
submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The 
only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an 
increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this 
facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from 
the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that 
the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I 
have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed 
for this facility in the near future.  

In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if 
there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit 
on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with 
previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that 
this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 
(emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed 
from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating 
throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make 
written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list.

175,"Michelle -

We are struggling with the appropriate company identifier for business cards.  We are employees of Enron America, however some of our business cards show Enron North America (carryover from days of old), EWS (no longer/or will no longer exist), and some show Enron Corp (International Admin group).

Marge Nadasky in Corp Public Relations who deals with the Company logo and Company names on business cards, etc., has indicated that Legal prefers we use the operating company we are part of rather than Enron Corp (piercing the corporate umbrella issue).  She did say we could use just plain Enron if we are not part of the corporate group.  

As part of a network services function which crosses all Enron business units, do you see any problems if we use Enron on business cards?  We have several who have changed positions or never had cards and need new ones.

Transactions

Major Events of September - November 2000

Garden State Paper -- closing and transition.

Triple Lutz -- issues surrounding potential divestiture, including internal 
discussions, review of data requests and responses, review and comment on 
both PSA documents, negotiations with both buyer's representatives, and 
discussions with clients.  Issues include salaries of employees hired by 
buyer (effect of Enron severance plan), other benefits for divested employees 
(including unvested stock options, insurance, vacation, etc.), process for 
divesture, payment of severance obligations, possible redeployment, etc.

Crane -- monitor due diligence, PSA review and comment, client discussions.

Falcon -- review diligence reports, client discussions.

E2  -- limited involvement in PSA and schedule review, data requests.


Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

Triple Lutz -- continued negotiations and document drafting.  Transition 
issues for divestiture will continue to be significant.  Litigation by 
persons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not 
to sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible.

East Coast Power:  If we sell our interest in ECP, there will be many 
transition issues due to Enron's providing benefits, payroll, etc. for ECP 
personnel.  Also, there will be transition issues for other services, 
including legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP.

Crane/Falcon -- could move forward; Crane is more likely.  Issues of labor 
unions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues.


Litigation

Major Events of September - November 2000

No employee-initiated litigation for 2000.

Non-compete litigation:  Currently, suit pending against Alonzo Williams in 
Sharolyn Wood's court.  Suit filed, no TRO sought.  Service in process.

Minor litigation:  Marentz & Co. v. Enron.  Suit for non-payment of placement 
fee.  Maximum damages $75K.  Discovery period ends this week, court-ordered 
mediation to follow.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect that we will be filing non-compete litigation in February and March, 
as people leave after they are paid their bonuses.  

We should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for non-compete litigation.



Documents Generated

Major Events of September - November 2000

New Consulting Services Agreement:  I prepared a new form of Consulting 
Services Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work 
Description for Net Works contract personnel. I received minor comments from 
outside counsel as well as client group feedback.  I will finalize the 
agreement, so that the new document can go into effect on 1/1/01.  

Standard Agreements:

I prepared:

  ___ draft employment agreements.

 ___ draft consulting services agreements.

  ___ separation agreement and releases.

 ___ retention letter agreements.

The number of employment agreements seems low to me, particularly in 
trading.  My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person 
in trading under contract, but wants to wait and see how they perform.  There 
are potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our 
non-compete provisions. 

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect that, after bonus amounts are announced, there will be a flurry of 
contract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus 
pool.  

Investigations

Major Events of September - November 2000

Anonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations:  I 
directed the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the 
company decided to employ them.  I and the team reviewed the results with 
Sally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of 
the consultants' surveys.  Sally Beck is contemplating communication to 
employees on results of survey.  [Other proposals can be discussed verbally.]

Texaco Hacker:  We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the 
Texaco computer system using an ID of a former co-worker.  He then sent 
inappropriate emails to her co-workers, posing as her.  The investigation 
results led to termination of employment for cause.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated 
following PRC/bonus discussions. 


Training

Major Events of September - November 2000

 Increased role as trainer.  I provided interview training for all Net Works 
employees who are involved in the Technology Track (about 10 sessions).  

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  

EIM:  Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials 
Group.  The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition 
of assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family.  

All of Wholesale:  The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated 
early next year for all persons hired in the last 18 months.  Refresher 
training is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went 
through the first round.

Pre-Hire Testing 

Major Events of September - November 2000

Many Wholesale groups are looking at pre-employment testing as a method of 
screening out applicants.  I am working with the Training and Development 
groups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards.  I have suggested 
experts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests 
will result in a successful employee.

Re-Skilling:  One aptitude test is being employed in the selection of 
potential employees who may be re-skilled to perform IT jobs working under 
Beth Perlman. 

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect the testing issue to continue to be hot, particularly since John 
Lavorato likes the concept for use in the Trading Track rotations for the A&A 
program.


Employee Relations/Terminations  

Much of my time is spent providing advice on employee relations/termination 
issues -- approximately 10-15 per week (total).  No two situations are alike, 
and they require significant time.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

After PRC/bonus time, this area of practice will be exceptionally busy.  The 
company will put persons who received a Needs Improvement or lower rating on 
a performance improvement plan.  Generally, I review those before they are 
put in place.  If they are not successful, then terminations are likely 
(probably early in the first half of 2001).  Those issues are time-consuming 
and full of risks.

Work for Portfolio Assets

Major Events of September - November 2000

Conclusions


ENA:  ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of 
manager and above.  I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring.  Lavorato has 
placed processes in place for hiring at that level, including the requirement 
of an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of 
manager or above.  

Salaries need to be reviewed for equity (by gender as well as by race).

Net Works:  Net Works has hired over 800 employees and contractors in 2000.  
I expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be 
managed out.  Generally, the IT personnel are not the best about counselling 
and documentation, so there may be significant work to be done to  ensure 
that risks are managed in that situation.  I have seen improvement in that 
group working with HR, and they have invited me to conduct training, so it 
may improve over time.

Contractors are another issue at Net Works.  A significant portion of the 
work force is contract personnel.  Microsoft issues could arise if 
contractors are allowed to stay on too long.

Misclassification under the FLSA is another issue.  Net Works has too many 
employees in the ""exempt"" category who should be classified as ""non-exempt.""  
I have raised this issue with HR, and they are working through it.  It will 
not be an easy fix.

EIM:  The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of 
talent as well as M&A activity.  HR has hired a person from Azurix to handle 
diligence for EIM, but only time will tell whether she will be able to handle 
the job.  

EGM:  EGM has the same issues of hiring and retention of talent as other 
groups within Wholesale.  That, plus the added earnings pressures, will make 
retention of key personnel essential.  I expect to see continued pressure to 
shorten the non-compete duration for this group.

201,"I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the ""Dynegy transition"" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.
2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers?
3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the ""contract roll off"" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative.
4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more ""reasonable"" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

Thanks,

Following is an excerpt from his recent comment. 

-Quote- 
NBCi created a joint venture with a company called Asiacontent.com.  
They both put 13 million dollars into the venture, before the stock
market took a plunge. The two owners of the new venture (NBCi Asia) lost 
over 95% of their market caps. NBCi recently shut doors entirely.

I was on the board of NBCi Asia, and managed the company as president and 
chief operating officer. We opened offices in Seoul, Hong Kong, Taipei and 
Singapore, and hired a very senior management team from some of the best 
known companies in Asia (like Samsung, Singapore Straights Times, Apple 
Asia). Media companies all over Asia were looking to do deals with us 
because we carried the NBC brand. Less than a year later, our funding was 
pulled, the offices were closed, and the only employees left were the 
lawyers.

210,"I will most likely not be able to attend.  However, my comment relating to 
this issue was a generalization of confidentiality clauses I've used on other 
interconnect agreements and other contracts, including the ""model"" 
interconnection agreement recently submitted to FERC by EPSA.  In essence, 
the issue is that the utility should not have the unilateral right to 
disclose any information to anyone they want that is sent to them in 
connection with a DG interconnection.  This would include ownership, facility 
output, markets for energy or capacity or ancillary sevices (if any) and 
maintenance schedules (these schedules may be coincident with a retail 
customer's facility maintenance schedule which itself may be confidential 
information between the generator and retail customer).  This information is 
potentially competitive and should be held confidential.  Potential wording 
for a simplified confidentiality section would be as follows:

""Unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or other 
provisions of law or as otherwise provided for in this Rule, the Electic 
Provider shall hold in confidence any and all documents and information 
furnished by the Electric Customer in connection with the interconnection, 
provide however, that to the extent it is necessary for the the EP to release 
or disclose such information to a third party in order to perform the EP's 
obligation herein, EP shall advise said third party of the confidential 
provisons of this Rule and use its best efforts to require said third party 
to agree in writing to comply with such provisions.""

213,"Jim/Rick/Linda--I have faxed to you a copy of the resolutions that came out 
of the Western Governors meeting last Friday.  We were pleased to see that 
there was no language endorsing price caps in the documents, nor was there 
even a section suggesting that they be studied.  The resolutions included 
many of our suggestions (power supply contracts,rate reforms to send more 
accurate price signals, demand exchanges, eliminating barriers to distributed 
generation, etc)  There was also a specific endosement of construction and 
expansion of pipelines and electric transmission.

The Thursday evening keynote by Bennett Johnston was typical old fox 
Louisiana style rhetoric saying that even though price caps didn't work, 
gee...just this one time, they should be instituted for just the short term 
(his client is SoCalEd).  The morning session started off rocky, with way too 
much discussion about price caps or cost plus ratemaking being a good idea.  
Mid way thru the program Gov Kempthorne affirmatively stated that he did not 
agree with price caps and that actually started the discussion back on the 
right road.  The Governors met in closed session at noon and then later in 
the day, and ultimately there were enough Republican votes to make sure that 
price caps were not endorsed.

DOE secretary Abraham was not particularly vocal during his time on the 
panel, but did give good anti price cap interviews with the press later. And 
good old market man Curt Hebert had some very strong statements against price 
caps.  His colleagues Massey and Breathitt were both there, and did not echo 
the same sentiments!

Paul and I will be talking in the next few days to plan our next strategy 
with this group...it will need some continued hand holding and work.  Please 
feel free to call either of us if you would like more specific info.  Please

218,"Calif Fails To Find Illegal Acts By Generators -Sources
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Monday.) 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- An investigation by California's attorney general 
and state utility regulators into alleged illegal behavior by electricity 
generators has failed to turn up evidence of criminal activity, persons 
familiar with the probe said Monday.
The sources - including two commissioners on the California Public Utilities 
Commission and an aide to Attorney General Bill Lockyer - said generators 
aren't likely to be prosecuted, even though it appears they did withhold 
supply, and that the state may pursue civil remedies as an alternative. 
""We have come to the conclusion that this type of behavior is not illegal,"" 
one PUC commissioner said. 
California Gov. Gray Davis was briefed on the investigation Monday night, 
spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Maviglio refused to disclose details of the 
attorney general's briefing, but said the investigation was ongoing. 
""We have not called off the dogs,"" Maviglio said. ""We're still pressing the 
attorney general to pursue the investigation."" 
The governor, who has repeatedly blamed the state's year-long power crisis on 
market manipulation by generators, is pressing federal regulators to order 
substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is 
fixed. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch said last month that she had enough evidence to 
take legal action against generators, but that claim was ""premature,"" another 
PUC commissioner said. 
The PUC commissioners said the investigation has uncovered evidence that 
generators created artificial shortages by withholding supply last summer and 
earlier this year, but after dozens of interviews with economists, traders 
and power plant employees found no evidence of collusion or other criminal 
behavior. 
""We do have evidence that they withheld power from the marketplace, that's 
documented,"" one of the commissioners said. ""The question is whether that's 
illegal, and I don't think it is."" 
The state is ultimately responsible for soaring power prices, the other 
commissioner said, because it passed a flawed deregulation bill. 
""The system that we set up requires the generators and marketers, in the best 
interest of their shareholders, to do exactly what they have done,"" the 
commissioner said. ""Unless they're talking with each other and there is 
evidence of absolute colluding, we're not going to get to first base."" 
The sources said the state may be preparing for a civil lawsuit against Duke 
Energy (DUK), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Williams Cos. (WMB), 
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and others, but that too is going to be difficult. 
""How do you sue someone for being unethical,"" the person in Lockyer's office 
said. 
A spokeswoman for Lockyer wouldn't comment, but said the probe is ongoing. 
Spokesmen for the energy companies also wouldn't comment on the 
investigation, but said they have submitted bid data and reams of documents 
related to how their power plants operate to Lockyer and the PUC. The 
generators have repeatedly denied allegations that they acted unlawfully. 
Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California at Berkeley 
Energy Institute, said the state would have a hard time proving otherwise. 
""I would not have expected them to find evidence of criminal antitrust 
behavior,"" Borenstein said. Prosecuting generators is ""a longshot,"" he said: 
""They would actually have to find a smoking gun and evidence that these guys 
were in the same room."" 
Phil Verlager, an economist specializing in energy issues, said generators 
didn't even act unethically, because the setup of California's deregulation 
law allowed generators to get away with withholding power. 
Even if no smoking gun has been found, tough talk by PUC President Lynch 
scared the suppliers, the commissioner said. 
""They got the message that they ought to play the game."" 
Lynch didn't return calls for comment. 
Davis said Sunday the recent decline in power prices in the West is a 
""function of the extreme pressure on the energy cartel from Sacramento."" 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the responsibility to hold 
generators accountable for behavior that produces unjust and unreasonable 
prices, even if it isn't illegal, Borenstein said.

219,"Our messages are getting a little mixed.   So .. to that end, can we have a

mechanisms if want it all.

P.S.  And I mean this in all seriousness.....  Many months ago, you were 
sitting in our small conference room and said, ""The Governor needs to take

figured it out."
227,"Been on two panels in the last two weeks with Florio--most recent yesterday. 
Dan Richard of PG&E was also on yesterday's panel.  Mike has now come so far 
as to push the ""core/noncore"" split a la the gas industy publicly (if you 
just wait long enough, people come around).  Dan Richard did not object.  I 
am pretty suspect about PG&E, though.  Dan Richard said things like:

I'm one of the people in my company who believes that, over time, the utility 
should exit the procurement function, but many policy makers want PG&E to act 
as a ""quasi-governmental"" body offering reliable, low cost service to small 
customers.
I don't think anyone wants anyone's mother to be thrown to the competitive 
market willy nilly.
People have to understand that the large customers are going to take all of 
the ""good"" power, leaving the ""dregs"" for small customers.

While I'm skeptical of PG&E--Dan said what he knew people wanted to hear but 
there was little conviction behind the words--there is certainly an opening 
that we should try to exploit.

In addition, Florio is now publicly agreeing pretty strongly that the gas 
model for utility procurement is one that merits a heck-of-a-lot of 
attention, i.e., set a benchmark, get the CPUC out of the way, and let the 
utility live or die by the benchmark.

There's daylight among the stakeholders, but a very large amount of 
uncertaintly regarding whether the administration, its appointees, and/or the 
Legislature will get on board.

Related Party Crashers? SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest at
Enron

By Stephen Taub

The Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that Enron provide
information regarding certain related party transactions. 

""We welcome this request,"" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO in a
prepared statement. ""We will cooperate fully with the SEC."" 

Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and
electricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys
reviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of and
approved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC
filings. ""We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in
connection with these transactions was considered and done,"" Lay added. 

As we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financial
officer Andrew Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profits
from transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The Wall
Street Journal. The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals
with Enron in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk
of losses. 


REPORT: E&Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVED
Later this week, Ernst & Young will announce that its revenue growth was
nearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the Financial
Times. 

Specifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenues
rose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year. In fiscal 2000, revenues
climbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year. 

The reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&Y fetches most of
its business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in the
first half of this year. 

""We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a period
of great challenge and change in our profession,"" chairman James Turley told
the FT. 

Rival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this year
through August 31. 

Another reason for E&Y's revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar. The firm
is expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in local
currency terms, according to the paper. 

Turley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term and
are instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debt
covenant issues, and security concerns. ""We're going to see more covenant
violations and that will drive restructuring issues,"" Turley told the FT.

235,"Thank you so much for taking the initiative to pray for me. God bless you and 
your prayer warriors. I am a strong believer and I have put all of my trust 
in God. I would like to also share with you that a friend of mine had to have 
one of her breast removed on last week and I know it was a test of her faith. 
She does nothing but minister to  everyone through prayer, words of 
encouragement;  and now this has happened to her to trust and be challenged 
in her faith. I do believe I will be okay and I also believe you heard my cry 
for a reason. I do need your prayers and everyone else's. I do need your 
prayers so that I can be at peace.
Thank you so much for caring. I will definitely keep you posted between now 
and next Thursday December 21st when I go in for my Ultra Sound.

Your friend in Christ,
Davette

238,"I promised I looked for you that night.  Did you go to the APB party at Grasshopper?  Last of four nights, huh?  I remember those days about 3 years ago.  So that probably means you have a three day weekend, and are back on for days Monday.  That's just my guess.  As for the band I was playing, I really don't remember which CD I had in there, but it was probably Dexter Freebish or Vallejo.  They are both from Austin.  You need to call me when you get back on days.  I'm going to a Halloween party this weekend at my manager's house.  It should be fun.  Are you planning any more trips back to Houston?

 "
239,"Rob, we may be saying the same thing here - for the EES outsourcing 
proposition (which is more than just asset management) as being defined by 
Rodney et al should be managed together by Industrial Origination and ECC.  
Although, I would agree that ECC should lead the sale process.  My view is 
that we should not and will not recreate the structuring, customer facing and 
execution requirements in Canada and Mexico required to do these deals. It is 
an important strategic iniative for ENA to complete a number of these deals. 
The problem is that a clear target list, joint accountabilities and schedule 
between the groups has not been rolled out which was discussed at Columbia 
Lakes.  All other industrial business other than P&P commodity/asset business 
is the perview of ECC.

Ultimately, I have not seen any outsourcing transactions from Canada in the 
deal structuring/due diligence queue.  The US group can help get these done 
and can help in the pitch.

worthwhile.  Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you

267,"Today is the final day to submit your nominations for the 2001 Chairman's Award.  Today is your last opportunity to nominate that special coworker who represents Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.  

Employees at any level can nominate fellow employees from anywhere within the Enron family - from the top down or the bottom up. All of those employees who have been nominated in the past may be nominated again this year.  Also, there is no limit to the number of nominations you submit. 

Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by the end of the business day today. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com.  In Houston, forms are available in the elevator lobbies as well. In addition, this year we have a new way you can nominate that everyday Enron hero. Simply pick up the phone and dial 713-345-2492, follow the simple and quick instructions and leave your nomination by phone.

The finalists for the award, the Chairman's Roundtable, and the Chairman's Award winner will be honored at Enron's Management Conference in San Antonio on November 15.

Thank you for your prompt attention and participation.

268,"Effective 2/1/02 a new company will go into effect called ENNG.  The company code is 179E.

The primary purpose of this company is to account for the payroll of the Enron employees who are currently on company 0179, and who will remain Enron employees after the 2/1/02 transition of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy.  

With respect to coding invoices, recording time and other similar transactions on Northern Natural Gas (0179) please note the following that are effective 2/1/02:
 
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 FAR order or project, continue using the same codes.  No changes here.
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 cost center, use the same cost center number except replace the first digit with a 5.  For example, if you would have charged 111222, charge 511222 instead.  These ""5"" series cost centers have been set up on company 179E, but their payroll and expenses flow into company 0179.  You will not be able to code direct to a 0179 cost center after January business (1/31/02).  
If you are becoming a Dynegy employee on 2/1/02, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 do not enter your time into eHRonline or the SAP timekeeping application.  During the next week or two we will be working with Dynegy on an alternative for capturing and accounting for your time and payroll expenses.
If you are currently a 0179 employee and are continuing as an Enron employee, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 continue entering your time as you ordinarily would.  Unless you exception code to FAR orders or projects, your hours will automatically go into the appropriate ""5"" series cost center on company 179E.  

If you have any questions or need additional information concerning these coding changes please contact Trey Meerbott at (713) 853-7003."

285,"Thanks to all of you for the kind words and very thoughtful flowers and 
wine!  We enjoyed both as we watched our 27th snowstorm of the year this 
weekend.  (Houston's looking better and better with each blizzard).  DF  "
286,"I recall that we set up a warning flag approach with market services last 
year to make sure that Sempra never ""goes physical"" without us manning the 
battle stations and deciding what to do.  Do you guys know who the noms would 
come in to in Market Services if Sempra ever decided to try to take their gas 
out of Cunningham and move it off system?  Care to venture a guess as to what 
that person would do if a 100,000 nom by Sempra into an IT contract for a 
haul from the Cunningham storage point to Demarc hit their desk?  Sempra 
couldn't nom the gas into a transport contract without first giving 
Kent/Sue/Morgan a physical delivery nom under the SF agreement, correct?  At 
which point we would immediately nom the SBA, correct?  

These issues may be important to our closing this year's deal if TCEM can't 
come up with the corp. guarantee.  I.e., if we can retain absolute control of 
the noms, do we really have any ""go physical"" risk???  We need to think this 
through.  DF  "

298,"Mike, Louis, and Drew,

This follows up on my e-mails to you and my conversations with Mike about 
this subject.  We want to make sure that you are not caught in a year-end 
problem if you want to get the usual December estimates for Unit bills.  
Unfortunately, as Becky indicates, if we do not receive your instructions 
regarding this by December 12 at the very latest, then it will be too late 
for us to do what you want.

I assume that if you want December estimates, you will also want them from 
outside counsel.  Last year, it took a good deal of time to get those 
estimates from the attorneys representing your (and other Enron entities') 
interests in the Grynberg/Quinque cases.  I have received no instructions 
from you with regard to these or any other outside counsel. 

We greatly value our representation of the GPG and want to help in any way we 
can.  Please let us know what we can do.

Britt

I reviewed them with Mary Kay and reported back to him.  He wanted to know 
what ""Settlement Amount"" and ""Net Settlement Payment Due"" meant on the 
schedules.  I told him ""Settlement Amount"" was the Kansas ad valorem tax 
refund obligation due under the Settlement, and that the ""Net Settlement 
Payment Due"" was what was remaining due if the producer had already paid 
money to Northern.  He then asked how the ""Settlement Amount"" was calculated 
and I told him that was subject to settlement negotiation privilege and that 
the parties agreed not to disclose any calculations or formulas in the 
Settlement.  Jrt"

342,"Group-

There is a new ""FIX"" for the Enpower to PX Report.  Due to the latest version 
of the trade app, the templates that we export and upload into CAPS need to 
be modified prior to uploading.  The templates now contain "";;"" when they 
need to have "";0;"".  So the temporary fix is to go into the template and 
manually enter the 0's where they are missing.

The procedure should be as follows:

1.  export th file to A:\\ as usual

2.  save the file to O:\\ Portland\WestDesk\California Scheduling\PX Final 
Schedules\Final Schedules as usual

3.  Open the file from the O:\\ drive and locate all consecutive 
semi-colons.  There should be a zero between them.  The easiest way to do 
this is the replace function.  In the search menu, select ""replace"".  In the 
""find what:"" boxe, place ;; and in the ""replace with:"" box type ;0;   Then 
choose ""Replace all"" two times.  Save the file and you're done.

4.  Upload the file into CAPS as usual.

This should prevent the problems we have been having with the upload and keep 
Brett happy.  Pete Davis is aware of the problem and we shouldn't have to do 
this for long....

Dear Mr. Harris:

Recently, there has been a lot of discussion and confusion on the
direction of the distributed energy (DE) industry. With the summer stock
price collapse and slow market development, many DE stakeholders are
re-thinking their strategies. Cambridge Energy Research Associates
(CERA) is as well.

In an effort to provide you with the most up-to-date, valued
information, CERA is asking each member of our Distributed Energy
Advisory Service to complete a brief survey so that we may better serve
you.  The survey can be found at the following link:
http://www.cera.com/survey/distributed

This survey is anonymous and all comments are welcome. We plan to
present and discuss the results at our Executive Retreat in Santa Fe,

Thank you for your time and we appreciate your input.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Cool Site of the Day

 


The ancient Chinese art of origami (which literally means ""to fold paper"") is 
remarkably documented at Joseph Wu's Origami Page. And whether you're a 
seasoned pro or have never heard the term until now, you've got to check this 
site out. For the uninitiated, there are many galleries to roam around that 
contain some of the wildest paperfolding you will surely ever see - check out 
Wu's own paper microscope for proof. You will also find the history of the 
art, links to origami sites across the entire Web, instructions on how to 
learn the art, supply information, and plenty of diagrams on how to perfect 
some of the more popular folds. Old pros will find a community thriving here 
that will support even the most wild paper-folders out there. Get to it!

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

I was hoping that you could answer a question for me. 

I have a copy of a NYMEX approval letter dated June 5, 2000 plus the 
interoffice memorandum
detailing the increase of Henry Hub Natural Gas positions from 17,000 to 
20,000.  They state that
this is in regards to the July ONLY contract.

However, the ECT generated report for Limits (the report Moscoso's group 
creates) dated June 19, 2000 
doesn't show this increase under the ""Delivery Month Limit Amount"" column for 
July NG contracts.
In turn,  the red flag, ""approaching limit"", pops up on the 21st.  This is 
b/c  the limit is still at 17,000 instead
of 20,000; the red flag probably wouldn't have popped up if the limit had 
been raised.  

Tell me your thoughts.

Thank you so much for all of your help.

trash will be picked up along Buffalo Bayou from So. Shephard to the Wortham

check in, you will be assigned to a work section.  If you are going to work 
at the Registration Desk, you need to be at Sam Houston Park by 7:30 AM.  If 
you are going to pick-up trash, you need to be at Sam Houston Park by 8:00 AM.

There will be a pre-registration desk set up in the Lobby of the Enron Bldg. 
sometime during the week of March 26th and I will let you know the exact 
dates when they are given to me.  If you pre-register, you won't have to

408,"Mr. Fastow,

I'm writing all of our participants and confirming plans for the upcoming
corporate finance meetings on May 4-5 here.  As a reminder, you are slated
to sit on the executive option/equity dilution panel on Saturday
morning.  Dave Yermack from NYU, the number one expert on this issue, is
presenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require
little preparation on your behalf.)

Also, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening,
May 4.  It will be held in the Baker Institute across from the business
school.  Tom Copeland is our speaker - (I think he plans to focus his
remarks on real options).  Vince Kaminski  has told me he will be at the
dinner, however his wife is out of town and will not be.

Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.   I look
forward to seeing you soon.  I've attached a copy of the program along with
a name rooster of those planning to attend.

            The exponentials we tried earlier (a+bexp(-cx), etc, fit well b=

418,"Naveen,

I got NGI-SOCAL prices for prompt, prompt+1,...,prompt+59 contracts.
For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as
well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns:

[ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t)

and compared the results to normal distribution. 

I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails! 

Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at
log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large 
returns more frequent than normal), 
which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

See the spreadsheet is under O:\_Dropbox\Tanya

419,"Ted,

We have the first running version of VaR model for the MG positions. Many 
thanks to Tanya and Anjam for taking lead
in this effort. We had also great help from Cantekin and Kirstee. We want to 
validate some  inputs
before releasing the number. Specifically, I want to make sure that both 
London and Houston work
with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion.

A few comments.

1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston 
(Cantekin)  and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs.
The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to 
multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee,
please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).

2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated 
positions and prices on a regular basis.

3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas:

 a. VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its 
portfolios. This is the liquidity risk
       resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the 
underlying positions.
 b.  We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating 
the position numbers (i.e. look
                      into the details of specific transactions).  From what 
I know, MG has a fairly rudimentary risk
       management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option 
prices (and deltas). They get some
                      option prices by calling brokers.

4. I think the current VaR is within 80-85% of the true number (assuming the 
inputs are right). But, as I have said,
     VaR does not capture all the risks that we have to worry about.

442,"Wattage Monitor is a service that helps electricity customers find a 
competitive electric supplier to help lower their bills. To SDG&E customers, 
they are offering a choice of 14 companies to buy their electric power.

Wattage Monitor Service Teams Help Lower Electric Bills 

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 21 /PRNewswire/ -- As summer temperatures continue to
heat up and electricity prices do the same, Wattage Monitor Inc.
(OTC Bulletin Board: WMON) offers consumers an escape by locating a
competitive supplier that can lower their bills.
    Customers of San Diego Gas & Electric can choose to buy electric power
from 14 other companies besides their regulated utility.  Most of these
competing companies allow Wattage Monitor system users to switch to their
service automatically.  And there are savings to be had.  In some cases
competing suppliers are offering as much as $120 per year in savings or more.
    ""With the surge in power prices has come great interest in saving on
electric bills,"" notes Gerald R. Alderson, President of Wattage Monitor.  ""In
response we have expanded our service, sent consumer service teams to
San Diego to help consumers choose a supplier and have made it easier to
switch on-line at http://www.wattagemonitor.com or through our toll-free 
service
reached by calling 1-888-WATTAGE,"" he added.
    The California electricity market is in a significant transition from a
regulated market to a competitive one.  But like telephone long-distance
service, a consumer must switch to a competing supplier to lower their bill.
As consumers increasingly become aware that they have a choice and switch,
competition is expected to produce even greater savings.  But consumers must
act to realize the savings available.
    Wattage Monitor is a nationwide, free to consumers service that offers
residential and commercial electric consumers their specific electric service
options through its website http://www.wattagemonitor.com or its toll-free 
service
888-WATTAGE.  Consumers may also easily and conveniently enroll with the
supplier of their choice.  Competing electric suppliers' rates and services
are posted by zip code.  Simple, straightforward, comparative and all in one
place.

Enron's Departure from Core Business
Takes a Toll on Performance=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) stock sustained further he=
avy losses on October 19 as investor confidence in the former Wall Street f=
avorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in=
 over four years. The energy giant's stock was off $3.32 or 11.45 percent a=
t $25.68 per share at mid-day trade on Oct. 19, making a cumulative loss of=
 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third-quarter loss of $638 mi=
llion. As of early morning trading on Oct. 22, Enron shares were priced at =
$21.99, a reflection of new developments (including a new Securities and Ex=
change inquiry) that have caused uncertainty about the company among invest=
ors.=20

Analysis: Enron's first financial report since the departure of former CEO =
Jeffrey Skilling in August has not done much to once again instill investor=
 confidence in the company, which has experienced one of its most turbulent=
 years in recent memory. While Skilling cited personal reasons for his depa=
rture, many analysts suspected that a significant drop in Enron's share pri=
ce and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role. A=
t the time of Skilling's departure, Enron's stock had tumbled to a 52-week =
low. However, based on the new 3Q report, it now appears that Enron's downw=
ard turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company=
's top spot. In essence, Enron's financial problems have been caused by bus=
inesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its cor=
e focus on wholesale power sales. It appears that Enron is learning a costl=
y lesson-namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company'=
s innovation, especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromis=
ed. The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron, as a good number of unre=
solved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry in=
to financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow=
 the company.=20

Let's first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the t=
hird quarter. As noted, as a whole the company reported $638 million in los=
ses, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its n=
on-core businesses. When we break down the losses, it becomes clear that En=
ron is struggling with its operations in three businesses: water, broadband=
 and the retail power market. Specifically, Enron reported $287 million in =
charges from Azurix, its water and wastewater business; $180 million in cha=
rges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations (including sever=
ance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts); and $544 =
million in what the company is calling ""investment losses."" Evidently, abou=
t half of the $544-million figure is related to Enron's investment in NewPo=
wer Company, the retail electricity and natural-gas provider that Enron lau=
nched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM. Enron owns =
45 percent of NewPower. In addition, Enron's debt to total capitalization r=
atio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent, although Lay says that p=
ending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002.=
 However, it is important to note that Enron's 3Q recurring net income (bef=
ore the write-offs) did increase 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a =
diluted share, and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 bi=
llion in 3Q 2000.=20

The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting. As one of=
 the leading investors in the company, Enron drove NewPower's aggressive bu=
siness focus on retail residential power sales, despite ongoing concerns ab=
out the development of retail competition across the United States. NewPowe=
r went public last year at an opening price of $21, and in the early days o=
f its initial public offering was trading above that price. However, the co=
mpany's stock has experienced a devastating drop in value, and is currently=
 priced at $1.25. NewPower is not scheduled to release its own 3Q financial=
 statement until early November, but it is expected that the company will c=
ontinue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Specificall=
y, NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3Q loss of $6=
5 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. Third-quarter revenue =
reportedly will be slightly lower than the $60 million to $65 million that =
the company had forecast in August.=20

In analyzing NewPower's 2Q financial losses (see IssueAlert from 8/8/01 at =
www.scientech.com/rci <http://www.secure.scientech.com/IssueAlert>), I argu=
ed that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negativ=
e factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in re=
sidential and small business markets in the United States. On the positive =
side, NewPower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts=
, most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from=
 AES Corp. and DTE Energy. These purchases prompted an impressive growth sp=
urt for NewPower, and the company reportedly now has a customer base in 22 =
markets in 10 states. However, the bad news for NewPower is that its losses=
 continue to widen, apparently resulting from a combination of weather fact=
ors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the compa=
ny operates. This dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better, and t=
he company's stock has continued to drop as a result.=20

In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes, NewPower recently rev=
ised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp. and several of i=
ts subsidiaries. The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cas=
h collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries th=
rough Jan. 4, 2002. With the lowered financial obligations that it must mak=
e to Enron, NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resour=
ces to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset=
-based financing.=20

However, from Enron's perspective, the losses associated with NewPower (and=
, by the same token, the losses in water and broadband) have contributed to=
 a steady drop in its own stock price. The message is clear: The businesses=
 that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as =
a whole. Further, what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enron's p=
art has not translated into measurable profits, and consequently Wall Stree=
t has reacted by sending Enron's stock to a level that is about half of whe=
re it was a year ago. The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all=
 unique, but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from wh=
at was a successful core business. Further, they are similar in that Enron =
aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which i=
t arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth. The problem with Enron'=
s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of f=
iber-optic lines, which has prevented the demand for the division's service=
s from materializing as anticipated. The problem with Azurix, which has bee=
n losing money since its formation in 1998, is that privatization of the wa=
ter sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies ant=
icipated. In addition to these problem areas, Enron also faces challenges r=
elated to its investments in India (where it is locked into a legal battle =
with the state government) and California (from which Enron has yet to rece=
ive full payment for previous power sales).=20

In addition to the losses outlined in the 3Q report, there are new issues t=
hat are brewing at the start of this week. First, the SEC has requested tha=
t Enron provide information regarding ""certain related party transactions.""=
 Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry.=
 However, it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns relate=
d to the dealings of Enron's Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who up =
until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from E=
nron. Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SEC's reque=
st. In a separate development, several mutual funds (including AIM Constell=
ation that once held large positions in Enron) have either liquidated or re=
duced their holdings in the company, which has further weakened Enron's sto=
ck value. Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about =
Enron's ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an =
energy trader.=20

The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company r=
emains on solid ground despite the losses. Thus, Lay has been quick to reit=
erate that earnings from the company's energy and gas-pipeline business are=
 still strong. Further, Lay says that the charges reported in the third qua=
rter should be seen as a way to ""clear away issues that have clouded the pe=
rformance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses."" Neverthele=
ss, the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward i=
ts diversification effort, and in addition to water and broadband the compa=
ny has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well. Thus, se=
veral questions remain at this juncture. Are the losses reported in the thi=
rd quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for t=
he company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trad=
ing? Or, will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002? Moving =
forward, will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the=
 various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably? On=
ly time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at En=
ron, which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change.=20

461,"FERC held its meeting today.  Big things happened.

Northeast

FERC approves PJM conditionally as the RTO ""platform"" to be used to form one 
RTO in the northeast.  FERC rejects the New York and New England RTO 
proposals and directs the three ISOs and all interested parties to 
participate in a mediation led by a FERC Settlement Judge with assistance 
from outside consultants.  The purpose of the mediation proceeding is to 
facilitate the formation of a single RTO in the Northeast.  The mediation 
must begin within one week from today and must conclude 45 days thereafter.  
The Judge must then submit a report to the Commission 10 days thereafter, 
which will include an outline of the proposal to create a single northeast 
RTO, milestones for the completion of intermediate steps, and a deadline for 
submitting a joint proposal.

While the Commission has not formally extended the RTO implementation date 
(currently December 15, 2001), Chairman Hebert made comments a couple of 
weeks ago and again today that perhaps the December 15, 2001 may have to slip 
some.  We will continue to monitor this issue.

Donna Fulton is sending separately a write up of similar action the 
Commission took with regard to the Southeast RTO effort.  

Please call me if you have any questions or comments.

486,"As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

489,"Louise -- The Houston legal/regulatory group is working with the UBS legal department to obtain from the London branch of UBS AG a power of attorney which will expedite the execution of agreements and other signature documents involved in starting the energy trading activities. (I will provide you specific information on the nature of this power of attorney as soon as I obtain it.)  To get this in place as soon as possible, we've been asked to provide backup information with sufficient specificity that the nature of each relationship/contract and counterparty is identified.  (Example 1: ""Wholesale power trading master purchase and sale agreement with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing L.L.C. and related transaction confirmations"".   Example 2: We would specify the contract and counterparty for each of the 44 gas pipelines which we need to utilize for gas trading operations in ERCOT).  

Accordingly, we will need to get (from Dave Forster?) the names of the priority counterparties, correlated with the list of the agreements we are seeking to complete with each.  I think it would be best if we were also provided such information on other, lower priority, tiers of counterparties, if they have been identified, with whom we seek trading relationships but which were not included in the first priority group who were sent materials.  That way, if lower priority counterparties surface and want to complete trading relationship documents with us, they will be covered by such power of attorney.  I am going to contact Dave Forster this morning to discuss this further.  I am also going to discuss this matter with LLoyd Will, who may be aware of other relationships/agreements pertinent to the start-up of trading operations, say, research oriented relationships involving data feed relationships, software licenses, etc.  

Jim Steffes last night started his group working on this from the standpoint of contracts, registrations, applications, licenses and other regulatory requirements he has identified for the UBS start.   Please contact me with any questions. --David Portz   "

I simply wanted to make sure that Ross and I were getting the latest news from ENA especially if you were considering using the platform in any longer-term manner, which is new information.  Don has been one of our biggest supporters, and I certainly want to make sure he gets some input on the direction of DealBench.  I just didn't want it to go through Tobias first.

Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Regards,
Terrie James

It sounds like your having a blast in Asia.  I have always wanted to visit 
that part
of the world.  I have some friends that are moving to London in January, so I 
guess
that will have to be the first trip I take.

On a different note, this wednesday was a bit like a stick in the eye.  
However, there's 
always next week.

Robin's last name is now Zivic, so her new handle is Rhonda Zivic (Honda

That's it for now.

531,"Sempra Could Be Takeover Candidate, Newspaper Says
 
The London Telegraph newspaper quoted an analyst who said that U.K.-based 
Centrica could 
be eyeing Sempra Energy as a possible takeover candidate following Centrica's 
purchase of 
Canadian gas and electricity supplier Direct Energy. 

Direct Energy owns a 27.5% stake in Energy America, whose remaining equity 
belongs to Sempra. 
The newspaper quoted Simon Hawkins, an analyst with UBS Warburg, as saying 
the Direct Energy 
acquisition is ""step one of something much bigger."" In principle, he said, 
there is no reason why 
Centrica shouldn't go after Sempra. Centrica told the newspaper it was

FERC Restructures California Power Market
Responding to a California power market gone haywire and teetering on the 
brink of operational and financial disaster, FERC Friday issued a series of 
remedial measures, virtually stripping the Cal-PX and Cal-ISO of their 
control of the market and calling market stakeholders together to negotiate 
bilateral forward contracts. 
The Commission's main action, effective with the issuance of the order after 
the Friday afternoon meeting, removes the requirement that California 
utilities buy and sell exclusively through the California Power Exchange 
(Cal-PX) and clears the way for bi-lateral contracts in the forward market. 
FERC scheduled a settlement conference for Dec. 19 in Washington of parties 
in the state's power market to negotiate those contracts. 
""California does [not] have the benefit of a competitive market,"" Chairman 
James Hoecker said, noting he had heard the state's power market called 
""crisis by design."" The design was ""an unworkable state law, the product of 
command and control that described in detail"" exactly how the market should 
function. ""It wasn't competition,"" Hoecker said. ""It's time to get serious 
about saving the future of competitive markets...Competition did not fail in 
principle at either the wholesale or retail level because it was never 
well-conceived or tried. This version of competition was a disaster."" 
Commissioner William Massey defended the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission's backing away from price caps.  ""Rather than cap the spot market 
created by the state of California, the order would simply shrink its size 
and diminish its influence."" This will ""give back participants' ability to 
find the right price; This ability is what California has taken away from 
that market."" 
Massey said the action would allow bilateral transactions, support forward 
contracts, and allow the parties to manage risk.  He urged the California 
Public Utilities Commission to ""step up to its responsibilities"" in 
supporting the FERC-directed activities. 
Massey said the transfer of wealth in what he described as the ""apocalypse"" 
in California ""is absolutely staggering. The two largest utilities are 
virtually bankrupt.""  He predicted a court, acting on accepted law and 
precedent, would eventually rule the utilities are entitled to recover the 
costs from customers, spreading the costs out over the entire state. 
PG&E Corp. officials lambasted the Commission's actions, saying they left 
California's electric customers ""exposed to price gouging and future electric 
supply reliability uncertainty."" 
""The California wholesale market is broken. And we are extremely disappointed 
by the insufficiency of today's FERC order,"" PG&E officials said in a 
statement. ""The remedies outlined in the order do not go nearly far enough to 
provide a solution that ensures reliability of the state's electric supply 
and equally importantly, provides relief from future price gouging,"" the 
Northern California utility company said. PG&E said it was particularly 
disappointed that FERC did not call for retroactive price refunds for 
California electric customers, as was requested by Gov. Gray Davis. The 
utility also said it was ""especially troubled"" that FERC shortened the 
timeframe for the electric price cap from the end of 2002 to April 2001, 
""leaving customers exposed during the high-demand summer season."" 
Sen Dianne Feinstein, (D-CA), said FERC's action was unacceptable. ""Rome is 
burning, our utilities are close to bankruptcy, Californians are facing major 
blackouts, and the Commission is fiddling."" 
Hoecker said similar competitive problems in states in the Pacific Northwest 
have led to pleas from governors and others for regional price caps. But he 
pointed to the fact that FERC is severely limited in what it can do in that 
region. For one, it lacks authority over the Bonneville Power Authority and 
other federal operations there, which make up a major portion of the market. 
Further, there is no Northwest spot market that can be capped in the way caps 
operate in California. There also would be problems with the many purchasers 
who already had hedged or protected themselves in some way. Hoecker strongly 
urged Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to convene a conference to try to 
identify regional problems, and offered his help in this. 
Commissioners Curt Hebert and Massey said they would issue concurring 
opinions. Hoecker said he will submit a concurring opinion next week on items 
such as RTOs that are beyond the scope of the order. The Commission's 
actions, which went beyond recommendations it had made earlier (see Daily 
GPI, Nov. 2), came at an emergency meeting following a week of continuous 
power alerts and emergency measures to avoid rolling blackouts in the state. 
The Commission's reforms call for: 
_ No retroactive refunds for California customers; 
_ Elimination of the requirement that California's three investor-owned

547,"Breaking News: Cal-PX Shuts Down Trading 
posted 2:47 PM (CST) Jan 30, 2001 
In direct reaction to federal regulatory moves Monday, the California Power 
Exchange (Cal-PX) board decided to shut down day-ahead and day-of wholesale 
electricity markets by noon Wednesday, Jan. 31. Today will be the last day of 
trading for the day-ahead, and Wednesday the final day for the day-of, 
bringing to a close one part of the state's initial 1996 electric industry 
restructuring law that created the state-chartered, nonprofit public benefits 
corporation to provide a wholesale spot market through which California's 
three major investor-owned utilities were required to buy and sell all of 
their wholesale power. They are no longer required to do so. 
""Regrettably, Cal-PX must take this extraordinary action in response to 
Monday's FERC order that directs us to immediately comply with the terms of 
its Dec. 15 order and implement a $150/MWh breakpoint,"" said Cal-PX CEO 
George Sladoje, who noted that there is a Feb. 7 oral argument set for the 
power exchanges emergency motion and petition with the U.S. Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals, requesting a stay and rehearing of the original FERC Dec. 
15 order. 
The Cal-PX will not close down entirely as yet. It will continue to perform 
all scheduling and settlement services for its current participants. ""Forward 
contracts will be scheduled via approved alternative delivery mechanisms, 
assuring both buyers and sellers will not be inconvenienced or exposed to 
adverse economic impact as a result of the suspension of the day-ahead 
market,"" the exchange said in announcing the market closings. "

551,"Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance

The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American 
gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western 
Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, 
PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the 
Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high 
load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge 
new rival for Western Canadian supply. 

""The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first 
of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the 
TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at 
about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly,"" said Klaus Exner, director 
of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. ""The big picture overview that 
I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and 
California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down 
that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and 
into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
letting up."" 

PG&E Gas Transmission Spokeswoman Sandra McDonough said PG&E GT-NW has been 
running full at 2.6 Bcf/d for some time and is delivering 900 MMcf/d to 
non-California load in the Pacific Northwest. ""We're turning back demand 
right now. Every power plant in this region is running full tilt. Tuscarora 
[Gas Transmission], the Nevada pipeline, is full. Our Northwest deliveries 
are fixed. We're delivering as much as we can deliver right now."" 

TransCanada's other major export route out of the Western Canadian 
Sedimentary Basin is the Foothills and Northern Border route into the 
Midwest. It also continues to operate at high load factors. ""We didn't see a 
huge drop-off in physical flows post Nov. 1. We've seen the IT volumes come 
up considerably,"" said Exner. ""The one thing that has changed is the 
volatility of the flows. Customers are making frequent intraday nomination 
changes and we're seeing more up and down and day-to-day variations, 
according to the weather and the markets, than we would have when we had a 
higher firm contract level. The fluctuations are driven purely by the price 
differential between AECO and the Dawn Hub in Ontario, which indicates 
whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not."" 

Alliance Pipeline spokesman Jack Crawford said the system has been running 
flat out at about 1.325 Bcf/d since the valves were opened for commercial 
service Dec. 1. He also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase 
flows on the system. It has been estimated that Alliance could increase gas 
flows to 1.5 Bcf/d with existing compression. The additional capacity would 
be divided up among existing shippers, Crawford said. ""We haven't cranked up 
the system above the contract capacity yet. We probably won't do that for a 
couple weeks until we get things ironed out. Frankly though, I'm not sure 
Chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the Pacific 
Northwest and California."" 


"
552,"Bush Administration Extends Emergency Supply Orders
Despite recent indications that the Bush administration would take a more 
hands-off approach to the California crisis, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham 
late yesterday gave PG&E and Southern California Edison another two weeks of 
breathing room by extending emergency orders requiring gas and power 
suppliers to continue supplying the cash-strapped utilities. The emergency 
gas order now expires at 3 a.m. (EST) Feb. 7. 
In granting the extensions, Abraham urged the state to get to work to solve 
its own problems. He said only California can implement the policies 
necessary to resolve the short-term and long-term supply challenges. ""Our 
action today is designed to give the governor, the California legislature and 
other relevant parties the time to take necessary action. I strongly urge the 
parties to act immediately,"" said Abraham. He also said he was keenly aware 
that other western states have expressed concerns about their own supply 
situation and the impact the order is having on power prices in their areas. 
Despite the action, PG&E said it still is having trouble getting gas 
suppliers to comply with the emergency order originally issued Jan. 19. ""The 
gas supply situation is [not good],"" utility spokeswoman Staci Homrig said 
yesterday afternoon. ""We are quickly depleting our storage. Even under the 
order, J. Aron & Co. [a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs] has not delivered gas. 
They represent about 9% of our daily needs (1.5 Bcf/d in January). 
""Oh yeah, we've been in contact with them,"" she said. ""We've been in contact 
with the DOE, too. The other two suppliers who had stopped delivering gas to 
us last week have made gas available to us under the order. They are Sempra 
Energy Trading and Western Gas Resources."" Homrig said PG&E expected DOE to 
take legal action against those who didn't resume deliveries. The order 
applied to 27 gas suppliers, all of which supplied gas to PG&E within the 
last 30 days. 
""There's not a lot I can say,"" said J. Aron spokeswoman Kate Baum. ""J. Aron 
has always complied with the law and we intend to comply with this order. 
That's my statement. I can neither confirm nor deny anything else."" 
Meanwhile, other suppliers who were not among those on the DOE's list, were 
staying as far away from California as possible. ""All I know is we're not 
selling in California any more. A person could get fired around here for 
doing that,"" said one marketer. ""All we had in California were a few spot 
deals that expired at the end of December. Needless to say we didn't re-up 
them."" 
Without the DOE's order, PG&E would be back where it was last week, with some 
suppliers stopping delivery, others planning to stop at the end of their 
contract terms and most suppliers unwilling to sell additional gas to the 
utility. 
PG&E has said it has enough gas in storage to make up for the lost supply 
under such a scenario until the first week in February. Homrig said PG&E's 
storage currently is well below 50% full, or less than 16 Bcf and depleting 
rapidly by about 500 MMcf/d to 1 Bcf/d. PG&E's Pipe Ranger web site shows the 
utility has been averaging about 500 MMcf/d of withdrawals over the past 
several days and is expecting a slight increase over the next few days. 

CA Launches New Buying Program; Supplies Remain Tight
Depending on your perspective, California either moved toward future 
solutions to its nagging energy crisis or took several steps backward 
yesterday with the launch of its electricity bulk buying program for 
long-term, fixed-price supplies. 
The auction began yesterday and will run through noon today. The state is 
seeking sealed bids for six-month, three-year, five-year and 10-year supply 
agreements. Whether results of the auction would be made public was still 
unclear yesterday, but the results are expected to be given to legislators, 
who now are debating various long-term solutions in the state senate. 
A spokesperson in the state Assembly Speaker's office said the legislature is 
basically ""standing by,"" awaiting more price information. Action on the 
proposed comprehensive legislation, including the question of the state 
taking over the private utilities' hydroelectric systems, should come by the 
end of the week. 
Merrill Lynch said yesterday it was ""increasingly skeptical"" that the 
""securitization for hydro"" plan would go forward. It has received ""muted 
support,"" Merrill Lynch said, and has not been drafted as a bill yet. Recent 
revisions of the comprehensive bill show some progress on contract 
flexibility, with the possibility that the value of the entire portfolio of 
energy contracts might be capped at a weighted average price of $55/MWh, 
which is well below the utilities retail rate caps (Edison at $72.40/MWh and 
PG&E at $66). The difference is expected to be used to pay down the 
utilities' debt. 
Meanwhile, the electric system limped along under the specter of another 
Stage Three yesterday, but without rolling blackouts, and elsewhere 
indications outside the state were that some energy marketers have written 
off California from their prospective marketing lists. 
""We're not selling in California any more, a person could get fired for doing 
that around here,"" said one Texas-based gas marketer, referring to the 
continuing credit problems of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which has been 
hobbled by the weight of its wholesale electricity debts on the natural gas 
side, too. 
In the meantime, Southern California Edison Co. is back in federal district 
court in Los Angeles, where it obtained a favorable initial ruling two weeks 
ago. This time it is asking for the court to force the California Public 
Utilities Commission to allow it to raise its rates to cover the wholesale 
cost of power. 
Calling the action with the court ""a last resort,"" Edison said it has tried 
to get the rate situation resolved, but at every turn it has met ""resistance, 
denial and finger-pointing"" by the CPUC's five-member governor-appointed 
board. 
The CPUC on Tuesday acted to anticipate new state legislation regarding the 
hydroelectric systems in the state by canceling hearings it had scheduled 
this week and next to go exclusively to written comments for the 
environmental review of the ongoing case looking at PG&E's hydro utility 
assets. ""The current energy crisis in the state makes it prudent for the 
commission to shift from public hearings to written testimony,"" the CPUC said 
in a prepared statement.

559,"I've made a stab at revising Lee's letter.
"
560,"My understanding is that the ABB equipment will most likely be used somewhere 
other than Calumet due to the noise issue.  It is possible that LM 6000's 
will be used on Calumet, resulting in a re-bid of the EPC contract.  However, 
none of this is etched in stone, and their are active discussions with 
Peoples about what to do.

I suspect this isn't much help. Paul probably has better information.

"
561,"Sorry if I'm a little late in the day.  I feel into marathon meeting mode 
today.

Here are my observations of the GE contract.  I tried to confine it to 
significant issues since it appears to me that the negotiations are far along.

General Terms and Conditions
I don't see where the buyer has much financial leverage for 
performance/warranty issues.  Final payment is made at shipment, with the 
Buyer having the benefit of a 10% retention bond; however, the retention bond 
expires at Provisional Acceptance.  There is no financial leverage for Final 
Acceptance or the warranty period.  Also, usually provisional or final 
acceptance requires that GE provide the operating manuals.

The assignment language (8) is somewhat narrow.  I don't know the deal, so I 
don't know how it fits. It can help to have language which allows for free 
assignment after provisional acceptance or payment in full, whichever occurs 
first.  Also, the contract can allow for a substitute guaranty as payment 
security, in lieu of the buyer guaranty.  Again, I don't know the deal so 
this may be fine as is.

The contract incorporates GE's proposal as a  part of the contract, but does 
not give an order of precedence.  I haven't seen the proposal or any other 
technical exhibits, but sometimes these can be very self-serving.  Therefore, 
you can potentially lose ground with what is in the exhibit.

Warranty.  The language is a bit confusing to me, especially the interplay of 
the 1st and 2nd paragraph.  Also, the ""outs"" they have are very broad.  It is 
better if there outs are limited to installation/operation/maintenance not in 
accoredance with their written instructions (alternatively, industry 
practice).  Also, they have an out if repairs are performed without their 
permission, but there's no time line or urgency for their response to a 
warranty claim.  A statement that they must provide a service engineer within 
3 days or so might help.  I also suggest being clear that 1.2 applies to 
warranty obligations, but their obligation to respond quickly to warranty 
problems need to be explicit.

Excusable Delay. (15) I would delete ""indirectly"" from the 3rd line.

Provisional Acceptance. I don't understand the phrase ""only to the extent and 
proportional share"".  Does this mean that GE may not be liable for the full 
LD's, or that the buyer has to prove  a right to collect LD's?

Litigation. The dispute resolution (mediation then  litigation) is not 
consistent with the usual arbitration route we request.

I didn't take a hard look at LD's, since I assumed these are settled.

13.6 Enron typically gets more precise language than this.  For instance, I 
would delete or clarify the phrase ""including that due to environment or 
operation"", as being vague.  13.6 (i)The phrase ""proper storage, 
installation, operation and maintenance"" should be as defined by GE's written 
instructions, or at least based on industry standards. 13.6 (ii) could 
conceivably allow them to drag their feet on a repair, then not allow us to 
get someone else to do the work.

14.1  The last line should include the words ""strict liability"" after 
""negligence"". GE ususally gives us indemnity for any hazardous substance they 
introduce.

This is a quick look.  If you need more detailed information (and you think 
there's time to negotiate further), I can look at it in more detail.

Kay




"
562,"Here is the ABB contract you referenced in your email.

I am working on a 97-10 compliant EPC contract for NEPCO/EECC.  However, I 
wonder about the challenges presented with the need for NEPCO to enter into 
subcontracts and purchase orders which preserve the accounting treatment all 
the way down the line. This is a very tall order given the contracting 
environment.

Your email is an excellent description of the challenges of doing a deal off 
the balance sheet, and worthy of further discussion.

Hello.  I am back in the country -  I've been out for 2 weeks since I picked 
up the car.  I am very happy with the car and your contact treated me very 
well.  The transaction went smoothly and they worked with me to get the car 
before I went off to Asia.

I wanted to thank you again for all your help and efforts.   I have had many 
comments already and there is not doubt that this will lead to a new wave of 
Enron purchases of Mercedes.

 I am a Mercedes believer.

Sincerely,
Mike McConnell"

A quick note.  I don't believe I ever followed up with you on your weather 
business plan.  I looked at it several times primarily in pieces while 
traveling overseas.  I read it again today and wanted to give you some 
feedback.  I thought it was excellent work and very well presented.  Thank 
you for all your effort. 

 I am in town this week, I canceled being out of the office an additional 3 
days, and I will be spending time thinking about weather as well as some of 
our other businesses.  I'll give you a call toward the end of the week to 
discuss some of the ideas you presented. 

Mike"

Mike/Jeff:  FYI"
573,"Sally,

Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly 
to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as 
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very 
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that 
you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you 
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that 
momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most 
don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I 
have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we 
wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to 
accomplish with their guidelines.

Please keep me up informed on this matter.

Thanks and good luck with the students.

"
574,"While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.  "

I enjoyed it as well.  We all have a lot to do and money to make!  I got a 
long voicemail back from K Lay on my message to him and he heard me on the 
ePower side.  He also said that he had heard similar concerns as well.  

Rick Bergseiker (LNG) will be calling you.  He left me a voicemail that he 
has been working with ePower quite a bit and has talked about 2 LNG 
facilities.  i told him to work with you.

576,"Dear Mike:

Glad to hear from you.

The Lichtenstein ""Composition No. 4"" is exactly like the one you saw except
that it would be a different number in the signed and numbered edition.  The
price is $4,500.00.  That is unframed.  We can frame the artwork like the
Liechtenstein you saw here or if you prefer like the Matisse.  You have that
option.

I will contact the owner and send you an image either by e-mail or by mail.
The window of opportunity to acquire the artwork is limited.

I would love to talk to you personally about the Matisse ""Icarus"" artwork.
When would be the best time to contact you and Chris?

As I mentioned to you this artwork is hard to find and cannot be easily
replaced.  Please keep in mind that several of our consultants are working
with clients and galleries to place this artwork.  I mention this only to
encourage to contact me if you have serious interest in adding this artwork to
your collection.

I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.

Most sincerely,

Thanks for the great news.  Also thanks so much for the gifts that I just 
received.  I wrote you a separate note on Friday, but I wanted to thank you 
again. The car is great and it arrived in a time of chaos and was a very 
pleasant distraction.

I am gathering information on my BMW so that I can sell that to the 
dealership at the same time I pick up my new car.  I will have all my lease 
information with me.  I have a few months left on the lease and will have all 
the needed information to complete the transaction.  If you would, please 
forward this to or let me know who I should deal with at the North side 
dealership.  I don't want another Bob Brooks situation to occur.  Also I 
don't want him dealing with the purchase of my BMW since I believe he is in 
that part of the dealership now.   I expect a fair price for my car and with 
our history, I don't want him involved in pricing my car.  I am confident 
that someone else will be better to deal with and will give me a fair deal 
with my cash purchase for the CL.  I guess I just need a name at the 
dealership. 

Thanks,

Yeah, what a game.  That 7 - 3 score that held most of the game was a killer on the nerves.  Both Defenses looked very good.  Both offenses looked like they were playing very good defenses.

I do like our coaching staff.  Bob hasn't always had things go his way.  During his first season (7-5) he tried some different type plays and many didn't go his way including a fake field goal in the Independence Bowl that probably cost us the game.  That being said, he has had a pretty good string lately.

Good luck with the rest of the season.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale.

611,"Clark,

My meeting with Mark was a big yawn.  He took the all to sensible approach 
and decided he ought to read the Memo first and get back to me. I imagine 
I'll hear from him later tonight or tomorrow.

In the meantime, the following sets of coal and ash handling agreements have 
arrived from ReUse Technology's Kris Johnson. Gerald Nemec, who works in my 
Group has been assisting Dwight Beach with this portion of the project.  He 
has alot of other work on his plate and is trying to recover from the flu, so 
we need your help.

I would appreciate your reviewing or having someone review the attached and 
give Gerald a call at 33512.  The principal concerns that I know to have is 
that the current drafts are taken from what were intercompany contracts 
between Cogentrix and this ReUse affiliate; thus, the contract may lack the 
protections that a service recipient should receive.  If there is a waiver of 
consequentials provision in these contracts, I would question whether that is 
to the benefit of a fee paying service recipient. Also, since we don't know 
how long Enron will be involved in the ownership of the plants, the 
termination provisions need to be particularly flexible. 

Finally, I will be sending you a rough draft of an O&M Agreement that Gerald 
prepared for use in negotiating a transaction with Jerry Campbell (of Power 
Systems) new O&M Company.  Gerald and I are expecting to receive comments 
from Dwight, better outling the terms of the deal some time soon.

I understand that Jerry will be in town tomorrow and Thursday--tomorrow is 
intended to cover commercial matters and Thursday is slated for legal 
matters.  Thus you review, analysis and understanding of the attached prior 
to that time would be helpful.

Please call me and/or Gerald as soon as you have had a chance to review the 
attached and the O&M Agreement.

"
612,"THIRD request!  Many of you haven't granted calendar access rights to our Legal Dept. Temporary IDs.  The temporaries that fill in for our Assistants need this access not only to set up meetings and keep your calendars current, but to refer to in case there's an emergency and you need to be found.

Assistants:  It is helpful if you block the time on your bosses' calendars for their vacations and trips.  That way when we call up the calendars the temps won't have to guess how to answer their calls.   (""I don't know where they are"" is not an acceptable answer!)

Please follow the instructions below. 

For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8

To set up access:
1.	Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and
	then ""Folder List"")

2.	Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab

4.	Left click on ""Add"".
	Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the ""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click ""OK""

5. 	You should now be back in the ""properties"" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the ""Shift"" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has ""own"" or ""owner""
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on ""Apply"", then ""OK"".

6.	Right click on your ""Calendar"" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.  "

Does the first sentence need to be revised to reference an amendment to the agency agreement?"

1.  Send forms of agreements to counterparty as a first step to get the process moving forward.  If you do not have a contact at the counterparty call the credit hotline at 31803 and ask for Jay Williams or another credit person who can help you get the contact name and number.  Credit is working diligently to get specific legal entity names to us as well.

2.  At the end of each day send a status update, including specifics of steps taken, to me and Carol St. Clair, cc Louise Kitchen, Bill Bradford and Tanya Rohauer.  Carol and I will summarize for Louise, Bill and Tanya, but copy them in case they are interested in any particular party on an urgent basis.  Management has asked that we contact the counterparties at least each day and keep this moving to closure of each agreement as quickly as possible.

INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom
Large Agricultural Processing"

I spoke with Nelson about developing consistency in the language for all of our contracts. As for the Notice of Variance section, we would like to use ""email, fax, phone or where an agency agreement governs, direct access to Operators"" for all of our Reciprocal Keep Whole confirmations. Please feel free to reword, but our intent is to excuse the Producer if we have executed an agency agreement because we are contractually obligated to get that information.

2.  Force Majeure - This would currently provide EE&CC with relief from the 
In-Service Date requirements and consequently, the LDs.  Is this acceptable?
3.  Permitting - Need to specify in Exhibit F, those permits that ENA would 
secure, and make EE&CC responsible for any others.
4.  Utility Coordination - Currently this is very generally.  Are there 
specific responsibilities that should be stated in this Agreement wrt the 
Utility?

"
649,"Cynthia,  Sorry about the way I left last night, but I needed to leave 
abruptly or I felt I would have lost it even more.  You are right.  This is a 
very difficult time in my life.  However, I want you to know that you are a 
very special person to me.  The more I get to know you the more I realize 
that we are very similar is so many ways and I think that is why we hit it 
off so well so very quickly.  

I wish I could throw everything I have into a relationship with you, but 
right now there is just too much anger, mistrust, and hurt in my emotions to 
allow that.  All of these feelings result purely from a person I was so close 
with and trusted so dearly and who treated me worse than I could have 
imagined.  These feelings have nothing to do with you and I am sure you 
likely don't understand it all fully.  I am not sure I understand it fully.

I fear I am making a big mistake, because I know you won't be available 
long.  You have so much to offer, beautiful, intelligent, funny, and someone 
who can give as much to a relationship as you need from a relationship.  All 
of these qualities made it so very easy to be taken with you when we 
orginally met.  When I started sensing some of my destructive emotions, I 
freaked out  because I knew we were becoming very close and it pained me to 
realize that I would hurt you.  So I completely pulled back, thinking I 
should cut it now than risk making it harder in the future.  Believe me, it 
is not easy to stay away from you, because even though we have only known 
each other a short time, I miss you and think about you a lot.  It would be 
hard to still see you and know you were dating others because I know I would 
react strongly as you witnessed at Senor Frogs that night.  My kidding you 
about Lee, I will have to admit, also shows my insecurity about that.

Mexico was so wonderful, because (except for that one night) I was able to 
put all of those emotions out of my mind and just focus on you.  I think that 
is why we had such a great time.  Cynthia, when we were together on that 
trip, I felt a lightness that I haven't felt in a long time.  You looked so 
beautiful and sexy in that swimsuit by the bar, and it was all about us and 
nothing else.  I have been through it enough to know that reality of my 
situation creeps back eventually.     

Cynthia you are such a great person and even just typing this note I feel 
like crying.  Sometimes fate is a wonderful thing and sometimes it feels like 
a cruel joke.  I think the timing of our meeting was ill fated.  I know we 
will talk to and see each other again but I know it will be different now.  
As much as I want to hold on to you, I know its stupid to attempt to keep you 
close and yet at some distance.  You have are too smart and have too much to 
offer to put up with that.

Please know that I do have genuine feelings for you and I miss you.

It is my understanding that Enron will not be receiving gas on Destin

682,"Dennis,

I'm attempting to understand how the UC-Davis deal, if done, will impact us .  How is this different than all of the other retail contracts that you service?
One concern that I had was if they opted to go for direct access and still had provisions to change their load on short notice(real time) this would cause some big problems for our real time group. To my knowledge, we don't currently have any contracts like this.  Is this the reason UC-Davis wasn't included in the original deal with the UC System?  Can you give me a call or an e-mail?  The number below is correct.
Thanks!

 "
683,"Dave,

Went OK.  I gave Susan a few issues that need to be worked on.

1) Imports/Exports do not seem to be getting captured inFSP.
2)SC trades - some ponts other than CAlifornia were being captured.

Some progress was made on Generation.  If entered in Enpower correctly,they appear in FSP. The only problem is once we enter deals in enpower at detailed points, The enpower to caps report does not balance.  We need Enpower to caps to be reformulated to include all NP SP and ZP deals including those at detailed points like sdg1,pandol_6_unit, etc.

The 10day test for day ahead is done as far as i'm concerned.  Susan was running template comparisons for the 1st thru the 3rd. which may need some work on our part.

 "
684,"Stuart - 

Thanks for your response.  At this time EPMI is unable to accept TVA's bid.  
Are the issues raised by TVA significant enough that, if amended,  would 
allow TVA to provide EPMI with a bid equal to EPMI's original offer?

EPMI does plan to go forward with an offering to several market participants 
on Monday.  EPMI will include TVA in the process if you wish.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MATCHUP OF THE WEEK by SI's Peter King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
New York Giants at Philadelphia, Sunday. What a difference a drive makes. Entering Week 6 this year at Giants Stadium, the Giants had won nine in a row over the Eagles. And after 55 minutes of that October game, one of the dullest in recent NFL history, New York had a 9-3 lead. Donovan McNabb could do nothing. Then he led a very un-epic 40-yard drive, found James Thrash for an 18-yard touchdown and the Eagles had broken the schneid with a 10-9 win. That one drive does not convince me the Giants still don't have the Eagles' number. These teams have changed very little -- except at receiver for Philadelphia -- since the Giants went 3-0 by a margin of 42 points over the Eagles in 2000. The key Sunday will be whether Kerry Collins can make five or six plays. The Giants need to score 14 or 17 points to win, because their secondary is susceptible to some McNabb playmaking. And, because the weather won't be a factor and the game should be determined on the merits of the players alo!
ne!
, I like Michael Strahan and Keith Hamilton to combine for three sacks, Tiki Barber to churn out, somehow, 112 total yards, and Collins to make a play or two in the fourth quarter. New York, 17-12.

POWER RANKINGS from SI's Dr. Z
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) St. Louis (11-2)
A very interesting shift in philosophy occurred during the week.  Mike Martz lifted the punt receiving duties from Az-Zahir Hakim, who keeps both sides in the game.  You never know whether he'll pop one or drop one, and Martz now says he'll trade excitement for steadiness, i.e. Dre' Bly.  Could this also mean, as the playoffs loom, that he'll try to get Kurt Warner to go a little more conservative, in order to cut down on the picks (two against the Panthers, bringing his season's total to 18, highest in the NFC)?  I don't think so, but I didn't think he'd ground Hakim, either.
 
2) Pittsburgh  (12-2)
I almost made the Men of Steel my No. 1 this week after their huge win Sunday.  But hey, it was against Detroit.  OK, we all know that the true No. 1 will be determined only after Super Bowl XXXVI, and all this stuff is just window dressing, but I will be monitoring the last two contests of both the Rams and Steelers very closely to see which team really deserves the annual prize award.  What's the prize?  Well, I'll be damned if it'll be a trip to Disneyland. 

3) Chicago (11-3)
Raiders fans, you're gonna have to wait your turn, and it's going to take longer than you'd like. The Bears made a valiant comeback on a typical week-after-clinching downer, while Oakland was taking its lumps from the Titans.  Chicago earned this position.  And I hope this serves as an adequate response to all the e-mail heat I know I'm going to receive.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW by SI's Peter King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver sees the chinks in Tom Coughlin's armor. He knows some players hate their head coach, and that the organization has been beaten down by him. But Weaver also sees a coach who's gotten a lot out of his thinning talent over the past couple of years. That's why I see Weaver extending Coughlin's contract two or three years after this season and allowing him to preside over the tearing down and reconstruction of the franchise. That will take a solid three years.

2. The Rams are trying hard to get London Fletcher's contract done before he hits free agency. He's more valuable to St. Louis than he would be to most teams, and they can't afford to lose him if that defense hopes to continue to play so well next season.

3. I can promise you that Mike Shanahan is staying in Denver. Promise. I've never been as sure of anything in my 18 years covering this game.

4. I keep hearing Notre Dame is keeping the seat warm for Jon Gruden.

UNSUNG HEROES by CNNSI.com's Pat Kirwan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
The Tampa Bay Bucs finally looked like the offense that was advertised last spring when they acquired Brad Johnson. It's amazing what adversity will do and how the offense had to get away from the conservative ""just don't lose the game"" mentality when the possibility of missing the playoffs was an issue. Offensive coordinator Clyde Christensen got a chance to open it up and the end result was 42 offensive points against a tough Saints team.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FANTASY TIP OF THE WEEK by CNNSI.com's James Quintong
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
Trung Canidate could be worth a start as a second or third running back in the last couple of games if the Rams build up big early leads in their last two games, which is entirely possible with home games against the Colts and Falcons. Marshall Faulk should still put up big numbers but could be rested if games get out of hand early, giving Canidate plenty of chances to shine.

Jerome Bettis may actually see some playing time this week but don't look for him to make much of a fantasy impact. The Steelers pretty much have home-field advantage throughout the playoffs already locked up and there's no real reason for Bettis to see a lot of action. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala continues to be a solid start, especially with fellow backup Amos Zereoue dealing with an injured shoulder.

$4.1 M was to have been reduced from our Q1 trading income to break out the 
origination correctly.  It looks like this was never done in your report.  I 
thought it had been based on previous Emails.  I don't think the p&l in your 
report is correct as it is $4.1M too high.  This is what our trading income 
at Dec 31 should be.  Note:  the DPR was never adjusted because the LTD and 
YTD numbers do not exclude orgination income.  It also looks like the break 
out by trader is not quite right

the
volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.    The AGL volumes are not current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

720,"We were very pleased to see the enthusiasm surrounding the opening of Enron 
Field yesterday as tickets to the first four games at the ballpark went on 
sale to employees.  Unfortunately, Enron was only able to obtain a very 
limited number of tickets from the Astros to these games, and as expected, 
tickets sold out very quickly.  Therefore, no tickets are available for sale 
going forward.

We appreciate the feedback, both positive and negative, that some of you have 
shared regarding the opportunity provided employees to purchase tickets and 
the process by which the tickets were sold.  We recognize that no method for 
selling such a limited supply of tickets would be without room for 
improvement.  The process was devised to  allow the majority of employees a 
fair and reasonable opportunity to secure tickets through Enron for one of 
these first four games.  While careful consideration was given to 
establishing a lottery system, direct sales were selected because of the 
magnitude of logistical issues surrounding a lottery of this scale and scope.
 
We established the 11am - 1pm time frame so that most employees could 
purchase tickets over their lunch hour, rather than during business hours.  
Much to our dismay, some employees began forming lines as early as 9:00am.  
By 10:00am, the crowd was so large that it presented a safety hazard within 
the building.  We began issuing flyers for tickets at 10:30am and selling 
tickets at 10:45am at my direction to eliminate any safety concerns.

Considering the demand for these tickets throughout the City of Houston and 
Southeast Texas, it is truly a benefit that Enron employees were provided a 
special opportunity  to purchase these tickets.  We regret that Enron does 
not have a larger number of tickets for these games to offer employees and 
that so many were disappointed.  We hope to be able to give away tickets to 
some of these games through special promotions, as well as provide 
opportunities to purchase tickets to other games throughout the inaugural 
season at Enron Field.
  
Tickets for all 84 home games are available through Ticketmaster outlets, 
including Houston-area Foley's, Fiesta and Kroger stores.  Those who wish to 
order by phone can call (713) 6-ASTROS.  Tickets are also accessible on-line 
at www.astros.com and www.ticketmaster.com.

Thanks again for your enthusiasm surrounding Enron Field."

752,"Tanya:

After the last meeting, I promised to ask you about the following:

(1)  Nova Scotia Power Inc. - this shows up as ""credit review"".  Should this 
remain on the list and if so, is there anything that legal needs to do?

(2)  Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. - this is the new ""Forest Oil"" of the 
list so I say let's forget it.  No, seriously, Carol did revisit the latest 
draft and said it was pared down about as far as it could go.  Further, she 
cannot get anyone at Occidental to return phone calls.

Please let me know what you would like to do.

Please call me or schedule time to discuss Bridgeline (""CP"").  In particular, 
you should note the following:

(1)  CP requests cross default with US 100 million for ENA and US 20 million 
for itself.
(2)  Change in ownership as default trigger is different from your proposal.
(3)  CP requests US 15 million Enron Corp. guaranty and increases its 
guaranty cap to US 15 million
(4)  Docs to be delivered:  ONLY CP's guarantor to deliver annual 
unaudited/quarterly unaudited consolidated financials 
(5)  Review setoff (elimination of affiliates)
(6)  Review transfer because CP has a proposal for ENA
(7)  Change to collateral thresholds - bilateral US 15 million

Also, I think Susan verified with you that you did not intend to use a 
non-specific MAC (even though the credit worksheet is marked as such).  

I'll wait to hear from you.

Subject: Proposed Enron/Petron ISDA documentation

Hi Sara,

How are things with you, m'dear?  Have you any exotic destinations planned 
for this year's vacation?

Anyway - I'm planning to go on vacation with my family (yah - it's weird to 
say ""family"" now!)  to Perth from Thursday 23 September through to Saturday 3 
October and was wondering whether you could help 'babysit' the Petron 
matter.  Janice had mentioned that you'd done some due diligence on ISDA in 
the Philippines a year or so ago so I thought that you would probably be the 
most appropriate person to look after this matter in my absence.  Matt, who 
is a new attorney who joined us in the Singapore office last week, will also 
be keeping track of this file but he hasn't been fully 'Enronized' by Tana as 
yet (tho' he will be so before Thanksgiving as he'll be headed to Houston 
next month for a month's stint there) so I thought it best if you could be 
the main contact person for Petron as well as for our business folks during 
that week that I'm not around.  I really hope that you don't mind.

Assuming that you're OK with this, I would like to give your name and contact 
details to the Enron AP/A/CHI biz folks who are handling this - Manuel 
Gallego in the Philippines, Victor Santos who is presently relocating to 
Singapore and David Terlip to whom they report.  The traders in the Singapore 
office, John Chismar and Eng Wang Moi , will be providing the pricing.  Matt 
and my assistant, Angeline, will get hold of you should they hear from Petron 
during that week.  The plan is that Petron is interested in entering into 
some crack spread swaps with us.  So far, Citibank and Chase have signed up 
ISDAs with Petron.

In the meantime, I'll have Angeline fax to you copies of all the 
correspondence which I've had had with our Filipino counsel QTE to-date so 
that you'll get a good idea of what the regulatory and legal environment's 
like now in the Philippines. [Angeline - can you please do that today.  
Sara's fax no. is Houston Legal's fax no.]

So far, QTE has reviewed our draft ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex and 
I sent it across to Petron's inhouse counsel on 8 September (please see 
attached) and I'm now waiting for their written comments on those drafts.  

Please let me know whether you'll be able to look after this matter for me.  
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks a mill,
Anita

 
"
765,"Your switchboard does not answer and I'd like to speak with you.  Please call 
me at 713/853-5620.

We'll e-mail two identical Schedules to you in word.  Enron Capital & Trade 
Resources entered into an ISDA with Barclays in 1995 and that Schedule was 
virtually identical to the one we're sending.  We therefore do not expect 
there to be many issues.  The banks should serve as Calculation Agents and 
confirming agents so we will look to them for the confirmations.  Look 
forward to finalizing these documents with you.  Thanks.  Sara"

TO:  NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS

FROM: Patrick F. Conroy, Senior Vice President

SUBJECT: TERMINATION OF MEMBERS RETENTION AND RETIREMENT PLAN

The remaining assets under the MRRP are being distributed to the participants 
with Continuous Service between 10 and 14 years under the Plan. Under the 
terms of the Plan, participants with more than 15 years of Continuous Service 
are entitled to receive a payout equal to the net present value of their 
calculated benefit, to the extent of assets held in trust.  Any remaining 
assets are to be distributed to the participants with Continuous Service 
between 10 and 14 years. In earlier notices, we estimated that there would be 
sufficient assets to pay approximately 26% of the partial benefits otherwise 
calculable.  However, after the final reconciliation of the census 
information used to calculate the original estimates, the liability 
associated with the fully vested participants increased substantially. The 
final calculations indicate that the remaining assets available to the 
participants with Continuous Services between 10 and 14 years will represent 
14% of the otherwise calcu!
la!
ted benefits.  (In dollar terms, the liability to the fully-vested 
beneficiaries had increased by approximately $1.4 million.)

In earlier notices we cautioned that the estimated benefits were subject to 
change based upon corrections to the participant database statistics. During 
the review process there were substantial corrections required.  A detailed 
explanation of the corrected liability amounts will be presented to the Board.

If anyone would like to discuss their situation with me personally, I can be 
reached at ext. 8-2285.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

interest down to Northern Border, the ISDA should be okay without any 
incremental credit provisions.

Thanks,

Currently, we have three ISDA Master Agreements under process.  Our potential 
counterparties are Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co., The Industrial Bank 
of Japan and Sanwa Bank Ltd.  We have produced these documents based on the 
credit worksheets prepared in Houston and in conjunction with Baker & 
McKenzie, Tokyo.  Mark Taylor is reviewing the drafts prior to presenting 
them to the potential counterparties.

I am not aware of any brokerage arrangements to which Enron Japan Corp. is a 
party.  I note that I have copied Jonathan Whitehead on this correspondence, 
as he may be able to provide insight regarding plans for entering into such 
arrangements.

California Changes Stance on Refunds 
Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks 
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, July 6, 2001; Page E01 
California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to 
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity, saying 
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 
billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year.
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is 
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term 
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for 
Davis. 
""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get 
us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. 
""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you 
want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion.""
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a 
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close 
to the negotiations.
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the 
amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach 
a compromise.
""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told 
reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I 
may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to 
conclude on Monday.
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides 
toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. 
Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California's largest utility, 
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at 
sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on.
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, 
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid 
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in 
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for 
all sides, is closed to the public and media.
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and 
his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the 
parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report 
confirmed by sources close to the talks.
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant 
Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for 
failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers 
have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off 
various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's 
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but 
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California's 
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher 
refund figure, some energy analysts believe.
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an 
overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have 
to pay for energy under those deals.
California's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed 
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at 
volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so 
did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating 
long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so 
far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power 
for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was 
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and 
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy 
analysts say.
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political 
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's 
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that 
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count 
as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" 
according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations.
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. 
""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said 
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" 
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the 
overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.
""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" 
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight 
committee for the California grid.
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room 
""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, 
sources said.
, 2001 The Washington Post Company "
799,"I have a few thoughts that I think are important:

At the opening of the second paragraph, I would laud him for mandating RTOs for all generators.  That's not insignificant and I think its important to offer some praise with our very valid criticism.

I think we need to take the opportunity to point out that the ""right"" number of RTOs isn't simply an arbitrary number picked from a hat.  Right now, it seems to be, especially with Pat Wood suggesting last week that CA might not need to be in a west-wide RTO.  Now we're at 6 RTOs.  Do I hear 7?

Lastly, I believe the final paragraph is fraught will peril.  I feel strongly that telling a chairman, or any member of Congress, ""this issue is too big and complicated and politicians will get it wrong"" is a big mistake, though it's regrettably true in most cases, Dick Armey excepted.  In their view, and probably in the view of most Americans, they get paid to deal with big and complicated issues.  

I believe we also set a dangerous precedent in saying ""trust the regulators.""  As you note, we're lucky that this FERC mostly gets it.  But the next FERC might not get it.  Nobody knows.  

Our point, that Congress doesn't need to act, has to be made in a more ambiguous way.


The real answer: Don't trust politicians, or regulators.  Trust markets.  Repeal the Federal Power Act.

Market-Based Rates for Ancillary Services

 Pursuant to Order No. 888, companies with general market-based rate
authority must separately obtain market-based rate authority for ancillary
services.  See Order No. 888 at 31,720 quoting the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) as stating: ""The fact that we have authorized a utility to
sell wholesale power at market-based rates does not mean we have authorized
the utility to sell ancillary services at market-based rates.""  Accordingly,
an entity with market-based rate authority must make a separate showing with
regard to securing market-based rates for ancillary services.

 In markets that are currently administered by independent system
operators (""ISOs"") - i.e., the PJM Interconnection, LLC (""PJM""), the New
York ISO (""NYISO""), ISO-New England (""ISO-NE""), and the California ISO
(""Cal-ISO"") - the FERC has previously permitted entities with general
market-based rate authority to sell ancillary services in those markets to
the extent that it has authorized other suppliers to sell such ancillary
services.  See Canadian Niagara Power Co., Ltd., 87 FERC ? 61,070 (1999)
(authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into the
NYISO and ISO-NE markets); Minergy Neenah, L.L.C., et al., 88 FERC ? 61,102
(1999) (authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into
the NYISO); Atlantic City Elec. Co., et al., 86 FERC ? 61,039 (1999)
(authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into PJM);
PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., 91 FERC ? 61,021 (2000) (same); see also New
England Power Pool, 85 FERC ? 61,379 (1998); Central Hudson Gas & Elec.
Corp., et al., 86 FERC ? 61,062 (1999); Connectiv Energy Supply Inc., 91
FERC ? 61,076 (2000); AES Redondo Beach, L.L.C., et al., 83 FERC ? 61,358,
order on reh'g and clarification, 85 FERC ? 61,123 (1998), order on reh'g
and clarification, 87 FERC ? 61,208, order on reh'g, 88 FERC ? 61,096
(1999), order on reh'g and clarification, 90 FERC ? 61,036 (2000).

As a general proposition, companies that have sought authority to sell
ancillary services in these ISO markets have simply requested the blanket
authorization for sales of ancillary services.  Many companies have added
that they desire the authority to be extended to additional ancillary
services and geographic markets, as the FERC may specify and authorize in
the future in orders that extend such authority to all sellers previously
authorized to sell energy and/or capacity at market-based rates.  See Edison
Mission Mktg. and Trading, Docket No. ER99-2434-000 (unpublished delegated
letter order issued May 7, 1999).

 The authority to make sales of ancillary services at market-based
rates is not, merely, limited to only those markets were established by the
FERC with operating ISOs.  The criteria for seeking such authority in
non-ISO markets is found in the Avista case.  See Avista Corp., 87 FERC -
61,223, reh'g granted, 89 FERC - 61,136 (1999) (""Avista"").  The problem
associated with obtaining market-based rates for ancillary services in
non-ISO markets has centered on the difficulty (or impossibility) of
obtaining estimates of other suppliers' abilities to supply ancillary
services to support a reliable market analysis that demonstrates that the
entity seeking such authority does not have market power in the relevant
markets for ancillary services.  However, in the Avista case, the FERC
authorized the provision of Regulation and Frequency Response, Energy
Imbalance, Operating Reserve - Spinning Reserve Service, and Operating
Reserve - Supplemental Reserve Service at market-based rates in non-ISO
markets with certain conditions.

 The Avista conditions require the Company to consider: (1) the
establishment of an internet site that provides information on, and
conducts, ancillary services transactions; (2) the posting on the internet
site of the offering prices of all available services; and (3) the ability
of customers to request services and make bids for those services using the
site.  Moreover, the entity must file with the FERC one year after the
internet site is operational, and at least three years thereafter, a report
describing its activities in the relevant ancillary services markets.  The
entity must also commit not to sell ancillary services at market-based rates
to:  (i) regional transmission organizations (""RTOs"") such as an ISO or
transco, i.e., where the RTO has no ability to self-supply ancillary
services but instead depends on third parties; (ii) a traditional franchised
public utility affiliated with the entity, or sales where the underlying
transmission is on the system of a public utility affiliated with the
entity; or (iii) a public utility that is purchasing ancillary services to
satisfy its own open access transmission tariff requirements to offer
ancillary services to its own customers.  Id. at 61,833, note 12.

 The terms and conditions associated with the provision of ancillary
services at market-based rates must be included in the market-based rate
schedule filed with the FERC and address the limitations on that authority
as discussed above.  For entities which have already obtained general
market-based rate authority, an amendment could be filed in their underlying
market-based rate dockets before the FERC seeking the authority to also sell
ancillary services at market-based rates consistent with the referenced FERC
precedent.

On April 26th, FERC issued an Order Establishing Prospective Mitigation and

previously forwarded FERC's press release outlining the major features of the 
Order, along with a brief e-mail explaining one confusing aspect of the 
Order.  This memo provides a more in-depth analysis of the Order.  In 
addition, we need to consider whether EPSA should seek rehearing or 
clarification of any aspect of this Order.  Filings would be due at FERC no 
later than Tuesday, May 29th.  Based on a review of the order, there are 
issues on which EPSA might seek rehearing, which are outlined below.  We will

805,"2 proposed decisions were released last night by the California PUC - one by 
the Judge and one by Chairman Lynch.  

Direct access customers are exempt from the surcharge. 
Each customer class is allocated an equal 3 cents, plus an amount to cover 
the shortfall from having residential usage up to 130% of baseline exempt 
from the surcharge (as required by law).  Each decision allocates a 
substantial portion of the subsidy to non-residential classes, although Lynch 
does this to a lesser extent
The new rates become effective June 1, and the shortfall from the actual 
effective date of the increase, March 27, through June 1 will be amortized 
over 12 months.
Residential rate design - 5 tiers will be put in place; the 5th tier (300+% 
of baseline) gets a 35 cent per kwh rate
Non-residential rate design - recommendations to put all of the increase into 
summer on-peak were rejected.  About 60% of increase put into summer.  
Real Time Pricing was endorsed - will further explore in workshops starting 
later in May.  Voluntary program will be started.
In a vindictive outlash, Lynch decision requires federal facilities to pay 
market prices under new schedules to be developed by the utilities
Judge's decision seems to require surcharge to show up as a separate line 
item; Lynch's decision requires that it not be shown separately

Oral argument occurs Friday and final decision is expected to be voted out 
Monday, June 14.

still looking at the real time deals to verify if they received all updated

The only deal that I see that their may be an issue on is 535568.1 where the

837,"These ARE a kind of desk-to-desk deal, but officially they are 
cross-portfolio deals, because they cross from the ENAEXEC to WEST portfolio. 
I'm not familiar with Unity, but let me check around here and see if anyone 
knows where these deals should be settled. Also let me know if the fact that 
they are cross-portfolio deals helps you at all. That's all I know right now.

me agreed to ADP the deal. I just gave him a call, but no answer. I'll try 
back in a bit, but I think we should be fine considering Mark Watts 
supposedly already agreed.

Thanks,

"
844,"Dead deal. See previous e-mail.




"
845,"This sequence of e-mails is a little confusing, so I highlighted the parts 
you probably want to focus on in red. Like I said, I've been staring at these 
deals for too many hours now to see clearly what went wrong. As far as I can 
tell, either APB or Jeff Richter was checking out wrong. Now I just want to 
get to the bottom of it! Aaaaaaaa!
"

Let me know.

849,"Dale and Karen,

Mark Taylor and a New York lawyer named Ken Rasler (great CFTC speech at 
legal conference guy) are coming to town as set forth below.  I am trying to 
get Elizabeth to come up then too but do not yet know her schedule.  For 
Monday night entertainment I am inviting you both to join the three of us and 
am wondering if this might be an opportunity to experiment with the bolt to 
the countryside approach.  I'm  tired of these dinners in town and wonder if 
we might not  be able to plunge forth into Arcadia by picking  them up at 
5:30 and  then drive up the gorge or up to timberline lodge or, hell, let's 
drive out to the coast for dinner, walk on the beach at night.  Anyway,  I am 
open for suggetions and hope you can join us.  "
850,"It never ends.
"
851,"Jeff:

That sounds like a great idea.  Are there limitations on such meetings?  I 
would think we need to be careful to avoid any appearance of impropriety.

Rob Walls has referred me to you. I don't believe we have met but I am (for 
my sins) the acting General Counsel at Enron India. We are thinking of 
starting coal trading activities in India and I am trying to get hold of some 
standard form contracts we may have used for our coal trading activities in 
North America. Would it be possible to forward any such forms to me so that I 
can start the exercise of seeing what issues we may have under Indian law. 
Perhaps you could e mail them or alternatively have someone fax them to me on 
(91) 22 288 1793/4.
Many thanks

857,"Attached is the revised GTCs that address taxation issues for non-Australian 
resident counterparties. These GTCs have received tax clearance and hence all 
approvals have now been given to allow them to be loaded. Enclosed also are 
the procedures that need to be followed when new counterparties are being 
considered. To date we have been vetting potential counteparties in the 
Sydney office. I suggest that the procedures be made available to anyone else 
who may be given this responsibility. 

One new matter has come to light. In July 2000 with the introduction of GST 
in Australia new legislative arrangements will come into place. They will 
require businesses to have an ""ABN"". It has been suggested that we amend the 
password application to request the counterparty's ABN.

858,"Mark:  Thus far, I have uncovered only one ""nondocumented"" electronic 
agreement.  The equity desk uses the services of POSIT which is an electronic 
trading system which matches orders six times daily for institutions and 
broker dealers.  There is no agreement for this matching service.  I am not 
aware of other ""matching services"" and whether any agreements are in place.  
Let me know if you have any concerns.  Thanks.  Sara"
859,"Note Chicago - Hong Kong rtn for $475.
"
860,"Attached is a draft of the Agreement we discussed.  The draft assumes that 
Enron will enter into an access agreement (or similar type of agreement) with 
the Sponsor or Platform and that this agreement will supplement (and, where 
necessary, supersede, the access agreement).  I think this is probably a 
valid assumption, because Enron will have to be a participant on the system 
on which it posts prices and the systems generally require all participants 
to sign a uniform form of agreement.

Feel free to call after you have had a chance to review it.  Thanks.

861,"Michelle is going to discuss this with Sharon Butcher (an outside labor 
lawyer we use).  Apparently there is some corporate policy against 
indemnifying employees but she understands there may be a distinction here 
due to the nature of Argentine law in the area.   We'll keep you posted."
862,"Mark -

You might consider treating the choice of law and submission to jurisdiction 
as two separate issues.  For example, if BC law is not objectionable, we 
could choose that law to apply but not consent to the jurisdiction of any 
particular court.  The most likely outcome (at least in many US states) would 
be that we would end up in a BC court if we had to sue them but unless we 
have significant contacts with BC (e.g. an office there) they would have to 
sue us in Alberta.

865,"Tom -

I spoke to Susan a bit earlier and she indicated you wanted an update on my 
progress for CL matters.  

To start the ball rolling, I have attached a form of the ESA marked to 
reflect my proposed changes.  As I completed this late last week and then was 
called out of town, I have not had the opportunity to fully review it; 
however, it will give you the direction I am heading.

I also spoke to Susan about other legal issues.  They are the following:

1.  GTC's - I am still not sure how the EOL GTC's can become part of CL 
unless they are there only for information sake and able to be printed.  If 
we use the EOL GTC's, we will have to modify them to be applicable to CL, a 
process that can be accomplished.  However, then we have GTC's for CL that I 
am not sure are useful.  Since all customers have to have agreed to an ESA, 
there is really no place for CL GTC's (e.g., there will be no phone or 
non-electronic use of CL). 

2.  Confirm Central - I am still not sure how we need to handle the 
additional terms and conditions that are necessary for certain products.  If 
the GTC's concept is viable, this is where this language should be placed; 
however, if the GTC's concept does not work, we have to develop another 
method of presenting them.  We could leave them in the Annex and merely 
indicate that anyone dealing with products in the classes for which 
additional terms are attached to the Annex would be subject to those terms by 
accepting the Annex; however, this would make the Annex quite long.  We could 
also have them pop up within the site once the customer clicks on the type of 
product (e.g., west power) to indicate that any action in this product is 
subject to these specific terms (this would require that we also have them in 
our site documents so that they can be printed).

Once I have reviewed the updated FRS's for each of the sites, I will work to 
modify the Annex documents.

Please let me know if you should need anything else at this time.

866,"Brent,
From an EnronOnline perspective we would not have a problem if we delete the 
last paragraph, since ETA and PA reference to the GTC applies to all products 
and not only to weather:
""Furthermore, any reference to the ""General Terms and Conditions"" in the 
Electronic Trading Agreement or the Password Application between the 
undersigned shall be deemed a reference to the Deemed ISDA"".
Pls. let me know if you have any questions/comments

869,"McGraw-Hill Sues Vanguard For Alleged Trademark Infringement On New Funds

06/08/2000
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- McGraw-Hill Cos., on behalf of its Standard & Poor's 
Corp. unit, has filed a lawsuit in
federal court charging the Vanguard Group Inc. with breach of contract and 
trademark infringement in connection
with the mutual fund company's proposed new Vipers exchange-traded funds, or 
ETFs. 

McGraw-Hill's suit alleges Vanguard breached the companies' 1988 license 
agreement by using Standard & Poor's
proprietary indices and trademarks for the Vipers exchange-traded products 
without permission.

Officials from Vanguard, the nation's second largest fund firm, weren't 
immediately available to comment on the
lawsuit. 

Exchange-traded funds are a hybrid version of index mutual funds that can be 
bought or sold during the day at
market prices instead of at the once-daily 4 p.m. price used by traditional 
mutual funds. ETFs are single shares of
stock that replicate an index such as the Standard & Poor's 500. 

Standard & Poor's currently has more than 400 license agreements for uses of 
its indices and trademarks, including
agreements related to ETFs, according to McGraw-Hill. 

McGraw-Hill wants to prevent Vanguard from using S&P's indices and trademarks 
in connection with Vipers or any
other exchange-traded security. The complaint also seeks an order requiring 
Vanguard to withdraw its Securities
and Exchange Commission application for Vipers, and seeks an order declaring 
Vanguard liable for unspecified
damages and attorneys' fees. 

McGraw-Hill's complaint states that Vipers differ significantly from shares 
of the open-end mutual funds that
Vanguard offered under the 1988 agreement.

Thanks for the note.

I think you have captured the questions. As to question 1, however, I would 
add that we are interested in an answer relating to on-line as well as phone 
trades. 

Mark, do you have anything to add?

We are looking forward to receiving your draft memo by the end of next week.  
I'll be in Japan next week, so if you have any questions, please foolow-up 
with Mark.

1.  Check the comments for Ms. Lewis' information.

2.  No, I indicated that the assignment and account agreement were 
essential.  I did not say that accompanying docs were not required.  I 
suggested that someone should verify with Cheryl Lewis.  Often, the broker 
will rely on our relationship and subsequent delivery of accompanying docs.  
This must be determined on an ad hoc basis.

"
874,"Julia sent me a copy of your memo following up on one of the questions asked 
at the session earlier this week.  I would like to ask a follow-up question:

Do we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code 
when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) 
netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we agree with a 
counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements 
(swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to 
determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a 
single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since 
arguably we are no longer just ""under a swap agreement?"" "
875,"Here are my pitiful attempts at photos from the trip:

"
876,"Stanford:

My only remaining comment would be a request that the we have a week to 
provide the notice we are required to give if we are unable to obtain the 
exchange consents - that would mean changing the date to September 7, 2000  
at the end of the sentence.

Otherwise it all looks good to me.   I will forward everything on to Mark 
Holsworth for his final review - particularly with respect to the affiliates 
issue.

Thanks very much for your help in getting this done.
