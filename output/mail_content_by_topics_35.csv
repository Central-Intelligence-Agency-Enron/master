BUSINESS ALERT
from The Wall Street Journal


October 24, 2001

AMR Corp. reported a third-quarter loss of $414 million, its largest
quarterly shortfall ever, blaming the ""disastrous financial effects"" of the
terrorist attacks and the continuing weakness of the economy.

Meanwhile, Sears, Roebuck and Co. said it will cut about 4,900 jobs in a
broad restructuring plan, as the retailer reported a 5.8% profit drop.

Eastman Kodak Co. announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs while reporting a 77%
decline in net and warning that fourth-quarter results may miss analysts'
estimates.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

10,"As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.

As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

2.	The cash to be escrowed is approx. $650K.  At money market rates of 3.5% the interest in six months would be over $10K.  Will the funds be held in an interest bearing account and will I receive the interest?

USA: UPDATE 1-Energy casts some light in gloomy profit season.

NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy and mining companies have provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third-quarter results on Monday and Tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years. 
Technology bellwethers Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which reported sharply lower profits, did little to buck the downward trend.
FirstEnergy Corp. , an owner of electric utilities in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected 18 percent increase in earnings, citing increased electricity sales and lower costs. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. reported a third-quarter profit that reversed a year-earlier loss, due to higher gold production. 
Yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule. Top chipmaker Intel said on Tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled 77 percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales. PC maker IBM announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of 1999 as weak sales continued to weigh on profits. 
Energy giant Enron Corp. posted a quarterly loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges. Companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls, including Caterpillar Inc. , the world's largest maker of construction equipment, and Unisys Corp. , a computer company. 
""The earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly, and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point,"" said Michael Holland, who runs the $65 million Holland Balanced Fund. 
FOCUS NOT ON EARNINGS 
""The focus (for investors) has been and continues to be outside of earnings, that is, the war on terrorism specifically,"" he said. 
Dynegy Inc. , a natural gas and power marketer and trader, on Monday said third-quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. While Enron posted a loss, it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business. 
""Energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down,"" said Jon Burnham, portfolio manager for the $170 million Burnham Fund. ""These are good, well-financed companies."" 
Caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes. The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing. 
The company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent. It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels. 
Unisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work. It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook. 
TAKING GRIM TIDINGS IN STRIDE 
Other companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc. , a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp. , the top U.S. discount brokerage. Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead. 
Money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride. 
""Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks,"" said Burnham. ""Barring unforeseens in the national and international situation, the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months."" 
""Whatever earnings are in this quarter isn't going to matter too much, except in cases where they're considerably better than expected or worse,"" he said. 
This week is the busiest for earnings with 15 Dow Jones industrial average and 180 Standard & Poor's 500 Index companies scheduled to report. 
Profits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by 22.8 percent, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial, making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of 1991. That's down from an expected 6.2 percent decline at the beginning of the quarter, and a 14.7 percent drop expected on Sept. 10, said First Call analyst Joe Cooper. 
Some 85 S&P 500 companies so far have reported quarterly results. Of these, 50 companies have beaten the most recent, often lowered Wall Street expectations while 26 have matched and nine have missed forecasts.

USA: INTERVIEW-Enron says may partner or sell broadband business.

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss-making broadband telecommunications business, which could involve selling the business or finding a partner. 
""In addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business, we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities,"" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Earlier on Tuesday, Enron reported that one-time charges of $1.01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in more than four years. 
Future options for the broadband business include ""sale, partnership, all kinds of possibilities"" he said. 
""We still think over time that it will be a valuable business,"" Lay said, but for now the broadband market is in a ""total meltdown"", he added. 
Enron's broadband unit, which owns an 18,000 mile network, posted a loss of $80 million for the third quarter, but Lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters. 
Enron launched its broadband business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential and has scaled down its operations. 
Enron's stock rose by 87 percent last year, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured, CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. 
Enron shares on Tuesday closed up 67 cents, or 2.02 percent, at $33.84.

USA: UPDATE 6-Enron posts loss after taking $1 bln in charges.
By C. Bryson Hull

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses. 
Enron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company.
""What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way,"" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call. 
Lay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm. 
Houston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000. It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997. 
The charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM. 
Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago. 
""They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield,"" said Meade. 
Enron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period. 
ILL-FATED BUSINESSES 
Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity. 
The company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled. 
Enron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets. 
Enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential. 
Enron's stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured, Skilling resigned and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings before one-time charges rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
The company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter, $1.80 for all of 2001 and $2.15 for all of 2002. 
DEBT ON CREDIT REVIEW 
Rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. The writedowns would reduce Enron's equity base, increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings, Moody's said. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division, the company's backbone moneymaker, grew 28 percent. 
The division, which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas, saw pretax income rise to $754 million from $589 million in the third quarter of 2000. 
All of the income growth in the segment came from Enron's gas and power trading and marketing operations in the Americas, where income grew to $701 million from $536 million last year. 
The European segment, which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals, coal and crude oil, remained flat at $53 million amid lower volatility. 
The latest earnings report marked the first time that Enron has provided a financial breakdown of the European and Americas wholesale operations. 
In doing so, Lay delivered on a promise he made after Skilling's departure: that he would make Enron's financial reporting more transparent. Many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from Enron.

Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)

Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)

     (Adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent
of Enron's profits over the last four quarters. Closes shares.)

     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, had a $618 million loss in the third quarter after
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost the company $1.01 billion.

     The loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred
dividends, Enron said. Net income a year earlier was $292 million,
or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion.

     Investors have sent Enron stock down 60 percent this year on
concern about investments outside energy trading and natural-gas
pipelines. Some investors praised Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman
and chief executive officer, for acknowledging the failure of the
new businesses. Others said they're not confident all the bad news
is out.

     ``What is disconcerting is that they didn't do this sooner,''
said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352 million Harris Insight
Equity Fund. ``If you kill one cockroach in the kitchen, it
doesn't mean there aren't more.''

     Investors have questioned Enron's financial reporting in the
past year, especially after Jeffrey Skilling's resignation as CEO
in August. Skilling, who helped Lay transform Enron from a gas-
pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading, said
he left for personal reasons. Investors said they weren't
confident Enron was detailing all its problems.

                         Failed Businesses

     The $1.01 billion in losses, which total $1.11 a share, are
equal to 70 percent of Enron's $1.45 billion in profits over the
past four quarters.

     Included were $544 million for losses on investments in New
Power Co., a venture formed with AOL Time Warner Inc. and
International Business Machines Corp. New Power competes for
energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and
gas suppliers as they do long-distance phone companies.

     The $544 million also includes losses from the Enron unit
that trades space, known as bandwidth, on fiber-optic networks, as
well as for the ``early termination of certain structured finance
arrangements'' with an undisclosed ``entity.'' Enron wouldn't be
more specific.

     Enron said restructuring the fiber-optic unit would cost
another $180 million, including severance pay to 500 fired
workers. The business collapsed this year along with the fortunes
of the dot-com companies that were expected to be some off its
biggest customers.

     The declining value of assets owned by Azurix Corp., its
water and sewage treatment business, will cost $287 million, Enron
said.

     Enron might take a first-quarter ``adjustment'' of less than
$200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill,
Lay said in an interview. ``If we thought there were any other
significant concerns, we would have taken care of them today,''
Lay said.

                         Excluding Losses

     Minus the losses, Enron would have earned $393 million, or 43
cents a share, up 35 percent from the year-earlier period. That
matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call.

     Enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent
for the past year. Its wholesale services business, which includes
energy trading, had income before interest, minority interests and
taxes of $754 million, up 28 percent from a year earlier.
     Shares of Enron rose 67 cents to $33.84. Earlier, the stock
had risen as much as 5.2 percent to $34.90.

     ``There's a sigh of relief that Enron's core businesses, its
energy merchant businesses, are OK,'' said Roger Hamilton, who
helps manage John Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares.

     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the
fourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.

                     `Ridiculous Investments'

     At one time, Enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that
contributed to the $1.01 billion in losses.

     Enron spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for the U.K.'s Wessex Water,
from which Azurix emerged. Enron sold shares to the public in
1999, and then bought back the company this year after Azurix
failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning
large projects. In August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's North
American business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million.

     In February 2000, Lay said trading bandwidth could become the
company's fastest-growing business. In the latest quarter, the
bandwidth unit's loss before interest, minority interests and
taxes widened to $80 million from $20 million a year earlier.

Revenue plunged to $4 million from $162 million.

     ``You can make the case that Jeff Skilling leaving was for
the best,'' John Hancock's Hamilton said. ``Under him, they built
the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous
investments.''

     While admitting its poor choices, Enron also supplied more
information this quarter about how it makes money. The company
gave results of individual commodity-trading desks, including
coal, forest products and steel.

     ``I liked that they broke out the different commodities,''
Hamilton said. ``I think Lay has gotten the message loud and
clear, and that the effort is there.''

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations

Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created. Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders. 
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months.
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share. 
During the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more than 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr. Fastow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper. 
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while ""we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well."" Mr. Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs. 
Mr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. But neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow-related partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts and others. Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was ""very concerned about the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about."" He added ""we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy."" 
Internal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to Enron SEC filings. 
During the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime Enron fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the company's often opaque financial reports. ""There's the appearance you are hiding something,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. ""You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board."" 
Mr. Lay responded, ""We're trying to be as transparent as we can.""

Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/24/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Enron has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities. 
In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.
But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it. 
The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000. 
Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said. 
After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.'' 
Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.'' 
Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. 
Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares. 
Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But let's move on to the next question.'' 
Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. 
Mr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises. 
The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct. 
After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company ''will look into providing'' such statements.

Options Report
Surge in Optimism Prompts Straddles In Enron and Cisco
By Kopin Tan
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
C14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Bullish calls traded heavily early as investors, encouraged by the ability of stocks to shrug off anthrax scares, bought calls to replace stock holdings and to ride any rallies. 
At one point, the ratio of equity calls traded to puts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange fell to 0.28, compared with 0.68 Friday and Monday's three-month closing low of 0.42.
The surge of optimism -- also evident in the CBOE market-volatility index, or VIX -- prompted traders to begin covering the downside, just as the widely watched stock indexes began to retreat. Contrarians believe the CBOE equity put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the session's end, the ratio was at 0.49. 
Buyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet switching equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at Letco, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands of January 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while 6,861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange. 
The implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as the energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the Houston company. 
The volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer rich premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at Miller Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would earn an investor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock. 
To be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire. Investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock, while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range.

Lay tries to assure Enron investors 
Company's credibility questioned 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron had safeguards in place to protect shareholder interests while its chief financial officer ran two investment partnerships that did business with Enron, the company's chief executive officer said Tuesday. 
The Houston-based energy trader has been caught in a storm of criticism over Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's former role with two partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with Enron. 
Enron disclosed Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an ""informal inquiry"" into transactions between Enron and the two partnerships. 
It declined to say if the SEC is looking into other transactions. 
After the disclosure, Enron's stock fell almost 21 percent Monday. Tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79. 
The news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Street that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its performance. 
Tuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for investors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns. 
It remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of questions during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard. 
""I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions,"" he said. 
Lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry. 
He did say Enron was aware an ""inherent conflict of interest"" would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron. 
In response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously followed, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised. 
""There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron,"" he said, adding that Enron wasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enron's best interest. 
Lay and Enron's board continue to have the ""highest faith and confidence"" in Fastow, he added. 
Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street. 
Enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships. 
It took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion as a result. 
During the call Enron executives also addressed other issues. 
They stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles, Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the investments. 
If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who follows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received some new information about Enron's lines of credit. 
""I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call,"" he said.

Busy signal 
Enron should know plenty about bandwidth.
Through Enron Broadband Services, the giant energy company boasts about ""developing an open and efficient market for bandwidth that provides liquidity, reliability, price transparency and guaranteed service levels"". 
But there were no guarantees about service levels yesterday, when Enron held a conference call to ""address investor concerns"" about its financial dealings. 
Despite the bandwidth expertise, the call - the first time that Andrew Fastow, chief financial officer, has faced questions about the transactions from analysts - was available to just 300 lucky telephone diallers. A live webcast of the call was accessible on Enron's website, but without the chance to grill Enron brass. 
Those investors and journalists who did make it through (some waited 20 minutes for their place at the party; others found their lines dropped mid-stream) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives. An analyst chided for his part in lowering the company's share price was told by Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, that his question quota was up and it was time to move on.

USA: Enron mulls ways to cover portfolio shortfalls-WSJ.

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. Treasurer Ben Glisan said the company thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment vehicles it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Wednesday. 
Enron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby diluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.
The report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due during the next 20 months. The entities are known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc, the report said. 
According to the report, Glisan said assets from those entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Enron is selling other assets, the report said. According to the newspaper, proceeds from those sales could go toward repaying the notes, which are ultimately guaranteed by Enron. 
Glisan, according to the report, said it looks like asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Glisan said, according to the report. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" 
According to the report, Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. 
Enron held a conference call on Tuesday, seeking to assuage investor concerns after U.S. regulators said they were looking into transactions involving the company's chief financial officer and its stock shed more than $10 billion in value over the past week. 
Enron said on the call it can tap $3.35 billion from a credit line, suggesting it has enough liquidity to operate its core trading and marketing business, which can experience wide swings in cash flow, depending on commodity prices and market hedges.

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations

10/24/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron (ENE) shares, diluting the position of current shareholders.
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months. 
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share.

Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750-million loan, ensuring access to credit if the beleaguered company is cut off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter. 
Enron's shares and bonds plunged after the firm said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its finances.
The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75% this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends on a $3-billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations. 
As a second-tier commercial paper borrower, any ratings drop may cut off Enron from the commercial paper market and raise costs of short-term debt. 
Enron shares dropped 86 cents to close at $19.79 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars over the next 18 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, treasurer Ben Glisan said. The possible shortfall related to about $3.2-billion (U.S.) in notes that related entities sold to investors since 1999, he said. Proceeds from those notes were invested in various Enron assets. Mr. Glisan said those notes come due over the next 18 months and Enron still hopes to sell enough assets to fully repay the notes. However, making up any shortfall with funds raised by selling stock has become more expensive as Enron's share price has plunged. Over the past week, shares of the energy trading giant have fallen more than 40 per cent.

Abreast of the Market
Everest Re, St. Paul and Providian Drop, but Markets Stay Resilient
By Robert O'Brien
Dow Jones Newswires

10/24/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C2
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Stocks ended only slightly lower as the recently resilient market largely withstood the effects of dismal corporate profit statements. 
Shares of drug maker Pharmacia fell $4.37, or 13%, to $38.39, after the company issued third-quarter results that topped Wall Street's forecasts, but also issued 2002 profit projections that left some analysts disappointed.
In fact, several drug companies saw their stock prices fall as investors responded to their quarterly profit statements. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products lost 1.40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, to 38.17. 
Shares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to 69.50, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25. 
Power utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after its third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from several analysts. 
Nevertheless, even with the grim earnings outlook, investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel. 
""Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market,"" Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason, said. ""Their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly, which is eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it."" 
Some seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently. For many mutual funds, for example, their fiscal year concludes at the end of October. Some are doing what is called window dressing -- buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio -- while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market. 
Whatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen, and modest moves when they have declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ran up 172.92 points Monday, declined 36.95 points yesterday, a loss of 0.39%, to 9340.08. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3.64 points, or 0.21%, to 1704.44. Volume levels showed some improvement over Monday's rather sluggish pace. 
Investors haven't completely rolled over. In a handful of the situations in which their ire has been raised, they have lashed those stocks repeatedly. Shares of SBC Communications, one of Monday's disappointments, got punished again, falling 2.62, or 6.3%, to 38.78, and fell back in range of a 52-week low of 38.20, set June 26. 
Consumer lender Providian Financial got sent to a fresh 52-week low, off 41 cents, or 8.3%, to 4.55. Enron, which has fallen on concerns about conflicts of interest in dealings among the company, a power marketer, and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, dropped an additional 86 cents, or 4.2%, to 19.79, hitting a 52-week low intraday. 
There were some winning profit statements. Shares of CSX, for example, rose 2.45, or 7.5%, to 35.19, after the Richmond, Va., rail-freight concern reported third-quarter earnings that, while they fell short of year-ago performance, nevertheless managed to top Wall Street's forecasts. 
Vitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated circuits used in high-bandwidth communications networks, added 43 cents, or 4.5%, to 9.99, even though the company's losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected. 
NetIQ (Nasdaq) dropped 4.23, or 14%, to 26.17, even though the Santa Clara, Calif., developer of networking software posted fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Chartered Semiconductor (Nasdaq) advanced 40 cents, or 2.1%, to 19.10. The Singapore chip foundry reported third-quarter results that showed a loss for the period, but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected. 
Shares of several cable-television operators moved higher. Charter Communications added 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.62, Comcast gained 40 cents, or 1.1%, to 36.82, and Cox Communications rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.15. Thomas Weisel Partners said that cable operators should benefit from SBC Communications' decision, revealed Monday with its quarterly results, to scale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering. 
EarthLink (Nasdaq) slid 2.51, or 14%, to 14.85. The Atlanta Internet service provider issued stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, but also signaled that its customer growth had slowed. 
AT&T Wireless increased 1.26, or 9.7%, to 14.20. The Redmond, Wash., provider of wireless communications services reported third-quarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Several steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U.S. Trade Commission, which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports; the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 28 cents, or 1.9%, to 15.02, Nucor rose 1.05, or 2.5%, to 42.87, and AK Steel improved 41 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.31. 
McKesson advanced 1.56, or 4.2%, to 38.95. The San Francisco drug distributor and health-care information technology provider posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results. 
Watson Pharmaceuticals fell 3.05, or 6%, to 48.11. UBS Warburg reduced its rating on the Corona, Calif., drug maker, and lowered its earnings projections for the company. 
Furniture Brands dropped 2.04, or 8.9%, to 20.96. UBS Warburg cut its rating on the St. Louis furniture manufacturer, saying it believes the company has lost market share to rival manufacturers.

NEW DELHI -- Following Enron Corp. U.S. energy company AES Corp. has turned to the Indian prime minister for help in settling its grievances with a state government. 
In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES Corp.'s President Dennis W. Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India is being tested by the government of eastern Orissa state.
A copy of the letter, dated Oct. 1, was made available to the Associated Press. 
AES operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49% of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. 
AES and Enron are the only major American power companies to make big investments in India since the government allowed foreign investment in the sector in the early 1990s. 
In his letter, Mr. Bakke drew Mr. Vajpayee's attention to the ""expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation . . . and direct interference with day-to-day management"" by the state government and its agencies.

UK: LNG delays could spawn shipping crisis - analysts.
By Pete Harrison

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The transport chain supporting the global LNG industry will be finely poised in coming years between profitability and a crisis of oversupply if projects miss their deadlines, shipping analysts warn. 
More LNG tankers than ever before are being constructed in the shipyards of the Far East, many of them ordered speculatively against anticipated demand, which might emerge later than scheduled.
""The issue is timing,"" Jarle Sjo, shipping equity analyst at Oslo-based investment bank First Securities told Reuters. 
""Historically, LNG projects have been delayed - you can estimate at about six months - and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term,"" he added. 
The world fleet of LNG tankers currently numbers 123, but will have swollen by about 37 percent by the end of 2004, according to shipping database Fairplay. 
Gas industry analysts expect some LNG projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn, excess capacity at existing plants in Asia and a sharp fall in U.S. natural gas prices this year. 
Svein Erik Amundsen, Managing Director of Norwegian shipping group Bergesen, said that a sustained economic downturn could have ""consequences."" 
""I wouldn't be surprised by project delays,"" he told Reuters. ""This could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment."" 
""I think you can say we're still optimistic, but more cautiously optimistic than before,"" he added. Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of which have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas. 
STOP AND THINK 
The world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, historically bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and consider the problem. 
Golar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under construction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment. 
""There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered,"" Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters, ""The only risk is things might be delayed."" 
Stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it was also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of them. 
Golar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more traditional approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance. 
""We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under offer for the (Qatari) RasGas tender,"" Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told Reuters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron. 
He said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agreements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders. 
""It's a good time to wait,"" said Saverys.

INDIA PRESS:British Gas Seeks ONGC Deal For Field Control

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- British Gas has offered India's Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) equity in its exploration acreage in Brazil and a cash settlement in lieu of operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields, the Economic Times reported Wednesday. 
ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) are claiming operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields following Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd.'s 30% stake sale to BG, according to the report.
State-owned ONGC holds a 40% stake in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields and Reliance owns 30%. 
The Enron Oil & Gas stake sale will fall through if BG isn't given the operatorship of the oil fields, Nigel Shaw, vice president of BG India said in the report. 
Shaw said the equity partners are in discussions on the issue of operatorship, the report said. 
British Gas is a unit of BG Group PLC (BRG). Enron Oil & Gas is a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE).

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative

Fitch-NY-October 25, 2001: Fitch places the following Enron
securities on Rating Watch Negative: senior unsecured debt
`BBB+'; subordinated debt `BBB'; preferred stock `BBB-`;
and commercial paper `F2'. Pipeline subsidiary `A-` rated
senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. and
Transwestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating Watch
Negative.

The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital
market reaction to recent disclosures by the company. The
loss of investor and counterparty confidence, if it
continues, would impair Enron's financial flexibility and
access to capital markets, therefore, impacting its ability
to conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announced
a $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken in
the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet
equity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding of
structured transactions. Since that time, there have been
several damaging news reports on the company and its
management. More importantly, investors have voiced
concerns. Enron's common stock price has plummeted and
spreads on its debt have widened.

The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly
stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its
business. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity is
available under committed bank lines.

An additional concern is that certain structured
transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II
and Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repayment
exist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlying
assets, or an equity offering, primary credit support is
derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily
convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to
repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120
days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger
event. In the event that the issuance of the preferred
stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the
senior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliver
additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on
its obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a
payment obligation of Enron, representing a general
unsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgrade
of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by
one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with
specified declines in Enron's closing stock price over
three consecutive trading days, Enron would have a
forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was
being made to register the shares. The total amount of
Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enron
has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitch
has no information to indicate that there are any
fundamental problems with Enron's core wholesale, retail,
and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contact
with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor
ongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.


STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow

10/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. 
At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52.
Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. 
Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. 
McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to ""buy- speculative,"" from ""buy-high risk"", to reflect his concerns that ""lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron's commercial operations."" 
""This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked,"" he said.

=DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings
2001-10-25 14:13 (New York)

   By Mark Golden, Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and John Edmiston 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit
quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in
policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the
companies said Thursday. 

  The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of
the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall
by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial
structure. 

  Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of
the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this
week. 

  ""We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,"" said John
Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). ""It's business as usual."" 

  Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made
no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and
gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged. 

  Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.

  ""Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,"" said
Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North
American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. 

  Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't
expect to make any drastic changes. 
 


Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues
By Andrew Dowell
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. 
The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions.
The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state's ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. 
""It's that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO,"" Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. 
Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. 
Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state's role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren't creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn't envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. 
The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. 
As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. 
Willing To Renegotiate 

Separately, Williams' officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. 
California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. 
Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. 
""We're always willing to sit down with a customer,"" Malcolm said. 
Williams hasn't been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. 
Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. 
""To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away,"" he said. 
Downplaying Enron Opportunities 

Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. 
Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron's proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. 
""That's interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing,"" Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. 
Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. 
Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. 
""We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers,"" Malcolm said. 
TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp.'s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.' Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co.

65,"""Center Circle"" (October 2001, Inaugural Issue)

In this Inaugural Issue of U.S. Soccer's new monthly fan newsletter / e-zine, you'll find the items listed below. Some will return next month, others will be entirely fresh for November.

1) Armchair Midfielder (MLS Playoffs)
2) Word Association (w/ MNT defender Jeff Agoos)
3) At the Movies (w/ U-17 MNT defenders Chris Lancos and Gray Griffin)
4) Queries and Anecdotes (w/ WNT midfielder Julie Foudy)
5) Big Woman on Campus (w/ WNT/U-21 WNT midfielder Aleisha Cramer)
6) Superstar!!! (w/ WNT forward Tiffeny Milbrett)
7) Mark That Calendar (2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup)

9) From the Bleachers (w/ PHILIPS chant contest winner Randal Bird)
10) ""You Don't Know Jack (Marshall)"" (U.S. Open Cup history)

1) ARMCHAIR MIDFIELDER
A monthly column about the State of Soccer, from the world game to Team America to pro soccer in the good &#8216;ole U-S-of-A, all with a healthy dose of cynicism.

This month, the Armchair Midfielder will handicap the second round of the MLS playoffs and go on record with a pick for MLS Cup 2001 champion.

So the defending champs are gone, and with them went their blase brand of defensive-minded soccer. MLS Cup will not be ""Goin' to Kansas City"" this year.  And let's face it, we as soccer fans are all better off with the Wizards watching the final from an Irish pub in downtown K.C.

Instead, we get a classic (okay, the word is a bit of a leap considering MLS is just a toddler) match-up between the Galaxy and the Fire. Here are two teams that have been good every year that they've been in MLS. Sure, they've each had their ups and downs, but you can always count on them to play attractive soccer.

""BEHIND CLOSED DOORS""
A section that will let you get to know the real personalities of your favorite Men's, Women's and Youth National team players through various funny and unique first-person accounts. In this issue, you'll find:

2)  ""WORD ASSOCIATION"" (w/ Jeff Agoos)
Jeff Agoos may or may not need some sort of therapy. Regardless, with 25 prompts on topics both easy and tough, we play psychiatrist to get a candid look inside the mind of San Jose Earthquakes star Jeff Agoos, one of the most accomplished defenders and one of the most enduring personalities in U.S. Soccer history.

""Goose"" has been a member of the U.S. Men's National Team program since 1985 and has the rare distinction of being the only men's player to compete on every major national team level offered by U.S. Soccer (U-15, U-17, U-20, Olympic, full Men's National Team and ... that's right, the game everyone loves to ignore ... Futsal). The 33-year-old veteran has won championships both at the college (at the Univ. of Virginia) and pro (D.C. United of MLS) levels and is currently being counted on to help the U.S. Men qualify for the 2002 World Cup after missing out on chances to play in both the 1994 and 1998 World Cups.

3) ""AT THE MOVIES"" (w/ U-17s Chris Lancos and Gray Griffin)
What to do between meals and training and meals and light out? For any and all of those that have been called into a U.S. National Team camp, the answer is: see a movie.

Perhaps no U.S. team sees more movies than those precocious teenagers from the U.S. Under-17 Men's National team. Strip mall cinema connoisseurs Chris Lancos and Gray Griffin recount summer blockbuster ""American Pie 2"", a shining beacon of good taste and sophisticated humor. It should be noted that both players were accompanied by an adult (most likely U-17 MNT head coach John Ellinger or goalkeeper coach Peter Mellor) to the viewing of the aforementioned movie.

Chris Lancos, U.S. U-17 defender and native of Belford, N.J.: ""Gotta admit it &#8211; I'm a big fan of the first American Pie.  Great movie &#8211; one of the funniest I have seen in a while. So I went in with high hopes for the second one... ""

Gray Griffin, U.S. U-17 captain/defender and native of Huntersville, N.C.: ""GREAT MOVIE!  Without a doubt, you need to see it if you haven't seen it.  I've seen it twice... ""

Continue: http://www.ussoccer.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=2464

4) ""QUERIES AND ANECDOTES"" (w/ Julie Foudy)
Off-the-wall Questions and Answers, Queries and Anecdotes from the veteran U.S. WNT captain and jokester herself

Center Circle: Who's your favorite superhero and why?
Julie Foudy: ""It has to be Spiderman.  Simply because I love the Spiderman theme song and I like to think I move across the field with the speed, agility and grace of a spider.  Then I woke up.""

CC: What's your biggest brush with greatness, meaning, who's the biggest celebrity you've met?
JF: ""Aside from Mia Hamm, who doubles as my caddy for her second job, I'd have to say Socks, the White House feline.  Socks was extremely hospitable and chatty, and made my White House experience very enjoyable.""

CC: If you were a cartoon character, who would you be? (And why?)
JF: ""Scooby Doo, because he always gets to eat.""

CC: Is there a better city than San Diego?
JF: ""If you can find me a place where the sun shines about 360 days a year and the temperature stays in the range of 65-85 degrees 12 months a year, you have blue water and sandy beaches and the greatest soccer fans in the WUSA, then maybe.  But I doubt it.""

Continue: http://www.ussoccer.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=2465

5) ""BIG WOMAN ON CAMPUS"" (w/ Aleisha Cramer)
A monthly ""How's School?"" report from the campus of one of the many players on U.S. Youth National Teams who finds themselves cramming for exams in between U.S. training camps.

This month, we get a page from the journal of BYU sophomore and Lakewood, Colo., native Aleisha Cramer, the U.S. Under-21 WNT veteran and rising star on the full U.S. Women's National Team.

If you've ever been to Provo, Utah, you probably know that there is not a heck of a lot do.  But after over a year at BYU, I am starting to realize that the city and surrounding area has a lot to offer -- you just have to be creative.

Still, most of my time during the college season is spent on the soccer field, traveling to the soccer field or coming back from the soccer field.  Oh yeah, our coach Jen Rockwood likes to have a lot of meetings too.  Basically, most of my day is taken by soccer and studying.

But despite all the time dedicated to soccer, believe it or not, I do have a social life and I'm really enjoying college.  I have a great group of friends and we always have fun.  The coolest thing is that we have fun just doing nothing.  It's amazing that we can laugh as much as we do just hanging out.

6) ""SUPERSTAR!!!"" (w/ Tiffeny Milbrett)
A monthly feature about a U.S. Men's, Women's or Youth National Team player from the U.S. Soccer Communications Department.

This month, we turn the big spotlight on all 5 feet 2 inches of superstar U.S. Women's National Team forward and WUSA Most Valuable Player Tiffeny Milbrett.

""Without Time For a Pit Stop, Forward Tiffeny Milbrett Powers Her Way to WUSA MVP Honors""

Like many young and successful professional athletes, Tiffeny Milbrett owns two cars.  And like many who love their cars, they reflect the owner in many ways.

The first, a jet-black 2001 Chevrolet S10 4x4 pickup truck, which Milbrett received for being named the 2000 U.S. Soccer Chevrolet Female Player of the Year.  (She upgraded from a four-door.  Not her style). The truck represents the ruggedness of the five-foot-two Milbrett, who despite her small stature, has scored 86 career international goals, good for sixth best in world history.  It also represents the outdoors woman and adventurer that she is, a small-town Oregon girl who loves nature and travel, and who spent a good part of three years of her life in Japan playing professional soccer.

Her other car is a gleaming, silver 2000 Audi S4 sports car is unique, sleek and does zero-to-60 in nothing flat.  With 275 horsepower, it darts past other cars, takes curves like it was on rails and looks good doing it.  It can go as fast as 165 miles an hour (Note to Oregon Highway Patrol: Tiffeny has never taken it that fast, as far as you know).

Milbrett drives it like she plays, at a few gears higher than the rest, and hell-bent to get where she is going, which is usually the goal, a journey that is almost always successful.

7) ""MARK THAT CALENDAR"" (2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final)
A stern reminder about an upcoming U.S. Soccer event, whether you plan to check it out live and in person or on the tube.

October has always been known for three things: Fall foliage, Halloween, and the abrupt cancellation of weak new TV shows like ""Emeril!"" (How bad can 22 minutes of entertainment be?) or another lame ""Seinfeld"" spinoff (Note to Michael Richards: Kramer's only funny in small doses). But for soccer fans, it's all about championship soccer. For U.S. Soccer, that championship is the 2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, American soccer's oldest tournament.

This year's title match is a first for both the Los Angeles Galaxy and the New England Revolution when it comes to the 88-year-old annual competition, which is open to all teams (amateur or pro) affiliated with U.S. Soccer and has made its mark as a ripe ground for inter-league upsets of David vs. Goliath.

8) ""POINT-COUNTERPOINT"" (w/ journalists Jere Longman and Steve Davis)
Every month, we'll pose a question or make a statement about something in soccer that will be debated on by two individuals from the same walk of life. Be it a coach, player, general manager, the two will each give their side of the story, so to speak.

In this case, we've enlisted the help of two soccer journalists. In one corner, wearing a Mia Hamm replica jersey under his shirt and blue blazer ... Jere Longman, who covers international sport and the Olympics for the New York Times and whose extensive coverage of the 1999 Women's World Cup turned into a book about the U.S. Women's National Team entitled ""The Girls of Summer."" In the other corner, wearing a worn-out replica of the now infamous U.S. Men's ""denim star"" jersey ... Steve Davis, a general columnist who's also been covering soccer for The Dallas Morning-News for over a decade and has covered the last two Men's World Cups.

This month's question: What event had a greater impact on soccer in the United States: World Cup &#8216;94 or Women's World Cup &#8216;99?

Jere Longman, pro-WWC99:
It is indisputable that the 1999 Women's World Cup had a greater impact on soccer in the United States than the 1994 men's World Cup.

The Women's World Cup produced an American champion, and the American public loves a winner. In three weeks, without benefit of lavish pre-game shows or newspaper special sections, the Women's World Cup built a galvanizing momentum. It went from almost zero on the public radar to a consuming moment that drew over 90,000 fans to the final match against China at the Rose Bowl and attracted 40 million television viewers...

Steve Davis, pro-WC94:
Back in the early 1990s, soccer was like the puny kid in junior high: lots of potential, plenty of good things ahead ... but still the last one picked for the team and having some trouble fitting in.

World Cup 1994 changed all that. It was international soccer's coming out party in the United States. A land that respects the big event, the colossal show, began to see soccer as a sport it could learn to like.

For soccer fans, it was their moment in the sun. More importantly in the big picture, Americans who wouldn't know a corner kick from a corner market tuned in to see what the fuss was about. Until the United States wins a World Cup, nothing else will be more influential in elevating the sport's domestic profile.

9) ""FROM THE BLEACHERS"" (w/ PHILIPS Chant Contest winner Randal Bird)
A monthly look at the fans behind the U.S. National Teams. In this case, one special fan by the name of Randal Bird has gone and made himself part of U.S. Soccer history as the author of the contest-winning Philips/U.S. Soccer chant that will hopefully be a part of international matches for years to come.

GOALS! GOALS! GOALS! Chanting to Your Heart's Content

When Philips Electronics joined U.S. Soccer in a partnership to help promote and develop the sport of soccer in the United States last June, their first order of business was launching a unique ""chant"" contest to challenge U.S. Soccer fans from all over the globe to log on to www.ussoccer.com and begin chanting to their hearts content.

Of course, choosing a winning chant for which hundreds of fans would eventually be asked to latch on to as their own was never going to be easy.  Fans come in all different shapes and sizes.  And so do stadium chants.

>From the long and melodic melodies of ""We all root for the red soccer team, the red soccer team, the red soccer team"" (as sung to the lyrics of Yellow Submarine) to the less melodic but rhythmic eloquence of a European chant like ""Stand up, if you hate Man U. ...  Stand up, if you hate Man U."", they each have their own charm.

10) ""YOU DON'T KNOW JACK (MARSHALL)"" (U.S. Open Cup history)
Think you know your U.S. Soccer trivia? Well...try us. We'll see how far back your knowledge of Team USA and U.S. Soccer extends. And who the heck is Jack Marshall? Even the trivia buffs in the U.S. Soccer Communications Department would be hard pressed to tell you that one Jack Marshall received his one and only cap way back in 1926. Okay, that was pretty much impossible. They get easier. We give you four questions each month, 1 to 4, easy to hard.

Answer #1 correctly, and it's safe to assume you haven't been stuck in a cave for the last five years.
Answer #2 correctly, and you already know more about soccer than any anchor from ""SportsCenter"".
Answer #3 correctly, you're probably pretty proud of yourself. Don't be. Try Question #4.
If you answered #4 correctly, you are either N.Y. Daily News soccer writer Michael Lewis or you own a U.S. Soccer Media Guide.

This month's trivia has to do with the annual, upset-friendly, ""knock-out"" tournament known as the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.

Questions:
Q1: (Difficulty level 1 of 4) True or False: The U.S. Open Cup is the oldest soccer competition in the United States.
Q2: (2 of 4) Who was the first MLS team to win the U.S. Open Cup?
Q3: (3 of 4) Who are the two United Soccer Leagues to team to win the U.S. Open Cup in the 90's, and what year did each team take the crown?
Q4: (4 of 4) What year did the Open Cup competition not have an outright winner?

NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Northwest Natural Gas Co is in the final stages to make an offer of $1.8 billion to buy Portland General Electric Co from Enron Corp in a deal that would bring the two Oregon-based utilities together, sources familiar with the situation said. 
They told Reuters that Northwest was offering a mixture of cash and stock and would also take on an additional $1.0 billion of debt, stamping an enterprise value of $2.8 billion on the assets.
The board of Northwest was still to vote on the deal but sources said the deal could be announced as early on Monday.

Energy Security Concerns On Congressional Front Burner
By Bryan Lee

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Congressional passage of energy policy legislation is unlikely to happen this year as energy infrastructure security has jumped to the forefront as a priority concern after Sept. 11, according to key House and Senate lawmakers.
""I'm not sure there'll be a bill this year,"" said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
It will be too difficult to reach agreement on the issues involved in passing a comprehensive energy policy bill and still get the measure through conference committee and to the president's desk before Congress adjourns this fall, Bingaman told an industry-sponsored forum this week. 
Bingaman has slated a hearing on energy infrastructure security for Tuesday, and plans to move legislation on the subject separately from the energy-policy bill. In advance of next week's hearing, Bingaman has solicited comments from leading energy industry groups. 
""The priorities have changed since Sept. 11,"" said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee. ""The energy security issue is now paramount,"" he said. 
Barton announced this week that he wouldn't launch a campaign next year for the Senate seat being vacated by Phil Gramm, R-Texas. The decision stemmed in part from a desire to stay at the House Energy and Commerce Committee panel he chairs to work on energy infrastructure concerns. 
Congress will pass energy-policy legislation next year and focus on energy infrastructure security this year, Barton said, citing the threat to power plants, transmission lines, and natural gas and oil pipelines. 
The two legislators spoke at an energy forum this week sponsored by Enron Corp. (ENE), entitled ""Energy Policy at a Crossroads."" 
The priority on infrastructure security was applauded by John M. Derrick, Jr., chairman and chief executive of Potomac Electric Power Co. (POM). 
""We in the industry are concerned about an energy hit on our infrastructure,"" Derrick told the two lawmakers. 
That concern is well-founded, according to James R. Schlesinger, who in past administrations headed the departments of energy and defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency. 
""Our electric power grid is particularly vulnerable,"" Schlesinger said, particularly citing the threat from ""information warfare."" 
Schlesinger's warning was borne out the week after Sept. 11. The North American Electric Reliability Council, the industry group that coordinates power-grid reliability, reported last month its telephones and other communications were temporarily knocked out during a flurry of computer virus attacks. 
With the onset of increasing wholesale power market competition, the U.S. power grid is operating at a much higher capacity than ever before, making it vulnerable to physical or electronic attack, said Schlesinger. 
This risk has been compounded since competition has ""weakened the incentive"" for utilities to make needed investment in transmission infrastructure, Schlesinger said. 
House Panel Acts On Nuclear Security 

While Bingaman's committee prepares to tackle the issue beginning next week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee took a first stab at the issue this week. 
On Wednesday, as part of a package of three antiterrorism bills, the panel adopted legislation making sabotage at a nuclear power facility a federal crime and authorizing plant security guards to carry weapons and make arrests. 
The committee adopted an amendment sponsored by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., requiring the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to undertake a comprehensive rulemaking to revise its power-plant security regime. 
""As terrible as the attacks of Sept. 11 were, a successful terrorist assault on a nuclear power plant could result in a full-scale nuclear core meltdown and breach of containment that could result in countless more deaths and injuries,"" said Markey, who opposes nuclear power. 
The NRC previously announced it is undertaking a top-to-bottom review of its security requirements in light of the Sept. 11 attacks. ""As decisions are made, they will be implemented,"" said NRC spokesman William Beecher, who otherwise declined to comment on the House action, which is under review by the agency. 
The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's trade group, criticized the House action as a rash response to the Sept. 11 attacks. Nuclear power plant security issues should be addressed as part of an overall effort to secure U.S. energy infrastructure, NEI said. 
""We believe the security issue has to be addressed in a comprehensive and thoughtful way. That wasn't done Wednesday,"" said John Kane, NEI's vice president for governmental affairs. 
Kane also called for Congress to firmly delineate the responsibilities of the federal government and industry in securing nuclear power plants against attack. It isn't appropriate for private industry to respond to threats from enemies of state, he said. 
Bingaman, the Senate chairman, said Wednesday that, while he supports federalizing airport security, he believes that nuclear power plant defenses should remain the responsibility of the industry.

Dabhol lenders to vote today on PPA PPPPA termination

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The 25-odd lenders to the Dabhol power project will vote today on whether the 
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) should be allowed to to serve a 
preliminary PPA termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB). The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing 
the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian 
lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of 
India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they 
will not be able to block the move.
Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in 
favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 
25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone 
conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. 
Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not 
participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries 
including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and 
OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. ""In the first round, Indian lenders put 
their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. 
Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian 
lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign 
lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice,"" said a source. The 
Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and 
cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore 
worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is 
complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the 
Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K 
Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a 
meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen 
that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal 
to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The 
domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is 
terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.

SAO PAULO (AFX) - Enron Corp will suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the 
Brazilian energy sector, news agency JB Online quoted Enron vice-president 
and Eletricidade e Servicos SA Elektro chairman Orlando Gonzales as saying. 
Of the total investment, 500 mln usd was to be assigned to the expansion of 
the thermoelectric plant Cuiaba II in the state of Mato Grosso, and in the 
construction of Rogen in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with the remainder to 
be invested in unit Elektro, it said.
""There are no clear regulations for the sector. Regulatory issues are holding 
back investments,"" JB Online quoted Gonzales as saying. 
Gonzales said the decision to suspend the investments may be reconsidered if 
the energy sector regulator Aneel establishes clearer regulations.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a 
statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or 
about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to 
meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. 
Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , 
proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.
Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its 
transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. 
In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it 
would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that 
will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. 
The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or 
enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement 
said. 
SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in 
central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate 
transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to 
over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. 
The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas 
pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump 
because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for 
construction. 
Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. 
And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern 
River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave 
Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, 
Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.
At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that ""industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia."" 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX

05/15/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made 
with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), 
whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading 
system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas 
Price Indices. 
NGX acquired the AECO ""C"" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot 
gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. 
last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the 
establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions 
conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues 
to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.
Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, ""We believe that inclusion of data 
from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North 
America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and 
integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which 
removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after 
reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we 
recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that 
""more is better"". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline 
system should improve the quality of our price indices even further."" 
Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, ""We are very 
pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive 
source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price 
indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline 
will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices."" 
The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by 
Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and 
Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action 
against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. 
NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by 
August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to 
the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant 
contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The 
methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be 
on a weighted-average basis. 
NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index 
Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com.

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 
billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the 
U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a 
United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. 
Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the 
project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.
Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans 
to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore 
North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. 
Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while 
UOG owns the remaining 51%. 
Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas 
transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government 
would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. 
However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put 
up the money itself. 
Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay 
significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will
operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing
natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are 
scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 
2005. 

Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners 
haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on 
the price of the pipeline. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an 
initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full 
agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.

1- Check the DOE Northeast Heating season  report.   There seem to be a lot 
of LNG terminal and facilities in the Northeast. How do they work? What are 
the logistics of transportation etc...


2- Arnold's buddy has been looking into the logistics of  trucking LNG to CA. 
Is this possible? Can investigate the probability?



Thanks

84,"Dear Jennifer,

Thank you for hosting a brown bag lunch session yesterday; your presentation 
was very informative and I believe it led to greater understanding of 
Business Development within GSS.  On a personal level, I was very interested 
in your Continental deal and would like to read a white paper or postmortems 
analysis of the deal after it closes.

I also thank you for taking an active role in this mornings' brown bag, I 
felt like it lent additional credibility to Experience Enron and answered the 
inevitable ""what's in it for me"" questions.

Sincerely,

Sorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that Eva referred you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I was planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't know.  I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program in addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk via phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good opportunities here.

To explain the P&L of -349,000  : 
We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.  The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.

Looking out for you bubbeh:

91,"Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree.   I think consensus 
opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the 
winter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection 
season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those 
projections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to 
price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the 
equation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand 
(mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies 
will be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as 
to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a 
comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number 
indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.  
Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be 
a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting 
noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand 
equilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.  
If we get two low injections, watch out.

where agressive inj now are bearish later.  so curve should flatten.  also 
back of curve (cal2,3) under a lot of pressure now.  customers will be buying 
all the way down and will get fucked just like last year.  contango has been 
under considerable pressure even with the front falling...any rally should 
result in those snapping in to 4.  good scalp in my opinion.
definitely seeing your side on the $5 level.  surprised we havent gotten more 
demand back as we sit at these lower levels.  
off to cabo today for a long weekend.  kind of exhausted at work right now so

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.  

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Christie was held without a point in last week's game against the Dolphins, 
but don't expect the same this week against the Colts. Christie is a solid 
Fantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between 
two teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.  

 Sylvester Morris , WR KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the 
Kansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics. ""I 
missed the majority of camp, so there's not that much wear and tear on me, 
but it's still a long season,"" he said. ""It's not so bad physically. But 
every morning I get up early, earlier than I ever had to in college. In 
college, you could schedule your classes. I never had a class before 10 
o'clock. Now I'm (at the practice facility) by 8 every day. That's a 
difference.""

Short of hand-counting each snowflake that has fallen in Telluride, resort 
officials have projected that nearly 4 feet of snow has blanked the area in 
the past three weeks. 9 inches of fresh snow fell overnight to the 
overwhelming joy of town residents. Resort officials are reporting a 29-inch 
base on the mountain, with more than a week to go before the ski area opens 
to skiers and snowboarders.

""Gearing up for one of the resort's best openings in recent history ranks up 
there, as far as current events, with finding out who our next Presidnet will 
be,"" said Steve Swenson, vice president of sales, marketing and air service 
for the Telluride Ski & Golf Company.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 KaRon Coleman , RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/04/00 
 Coleman has been ruled out of                    Sunday's game because of an 
ankle injury.  Mike Anderson will back up Terrell Davis and see most, if not 
all relief work that is available.  

 Robert Chancey , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Chancey has faded from view as a Fantasy player. The Chargers appear to be 
more comfortable with Terrell Fletcher and Jermaine Fazande as featured 
runners.  

 Curtis Conway , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 11/03/00 
 Conway might have a big day at Seattle. The Chargers will surely move him 
around and send him deep in an effort to keep the vulnerable Seahawks' 
secondary off balance.  
 Jeff Graham , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 11/03/00 
 Graham has been mostly quiet during the month of October. The Chargers seem 
to be more dependent on Freddie Jones and are waiting for Curtis Conway to 
develop some consistency.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Jones could approach 100 receiving yards at Seattle. The Seahawks do not 
have the bulk necessary at MLB or at the safeties to contain him.   

 Jermaine Fazande , RB SD - Murder Inc. Updated 11/03/00 
 Fazande might be a sleeper selection this week. He always gives Seattle's 
LBs problems with his strength and tenacity.   

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 The Chargers have the personnel to defuse Seattle this week. The secondary 
will pounce on Jon Kitna's mistakes and the front seven will swarm all over 
Ricky Watters and Shaun Alexander.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 John Carney has made his last 10 field goal attempts against the Seahawks. 
Expect him to roll up more good numbers against them this week.  

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 The Seahawks have been crippled by an apparent choice to play zone 
coverages. Opponents simply avoid Shawn Springs and light up the other DBs. 
Jim Harbaugh is sure to follow the opposing blueprint for success this week.  
 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Lindell has shown some flashes of brilliance as Seattle's kicker, but the 
Seahawks' offense is hindering his productivity.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/03/00 
 Dawkins has been showing some signs of life recently. The Seahawks need him 
to go over the middle more if they want to establish continuity on offense.  

 Derrick Mayes , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Mayes will make his return to the starting lineup this week. Rookie Darrell 
Jackson has been demoted to the No. 3 WR spot.  

 Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/03/00 
 Ricky Watters has been pronounced fit to start this week. Alexander should 
see some carries in relief, though.  

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Kitna will start again this week as the Seahawks take on the Chargers, who 
have a vulnerable, but opportunistic secondary.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Peterson has quickly proved he is still a reliable kicker. The Chiefs will 
give him consistent opportunties to score this year.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Mean Machine Updated 11/03/00 
 Janikowski is finally living up to his billing after a rough start. The 
Raiders will give him plenty of opportunities to score against the Chiefs 
this week.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 11/03/00 
 Richardson is still seeing some carries and remains an occasional passing 
target. He is worth a reserve spot on rosters in larger leagues.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/03/00 
 Anders is showing signs of becoming a reliable Fantasy runner. He may still 
give away some carries in goal-line packages, though.  

 Rickey Dudley , TE OAK - Risk Managers Updated 11/03/00 
 Dudley has become a Fantasy non-factor. Don't expect much from him against 
an aggressive Kansas City defense.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - FDIC Updated 11/03/00 
 Gonzalez has always played well against Oakland. Expect him to find the end 
zone at least once on Sunday.  

 James Jett , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Jett's starting job might be about to slip away. Oakland is simply waiting 
for Andre Rison to have a breakthrough game as a Raider.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Brown usually comes up big in AFC West contests. Look for him to terrorize 
the Chiefs this week.  

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Fear Updated 11/03/00 
 The Chiefs usually have trouble containing Gannon. Look for KC to play a 
containment style of defense rather than risk getting burned on blitzes.   

 Ed McCaffrey , WR DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 McCaffrey could have a good game against the Jets. Brian Griese will look to 
take pressure off a returning Terrell Davis by utilizing the passing game 
early.  

 Rod Smith , WR DEN - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Smith is a good play this week. He will use his height to outmanuever the 
Jets' cornerbacks.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 Elam's efficiency will be tested by the swirling winds in New Jersey this 
week. The Meadowlands will present him with a stiff challenge.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 Carswell has become less of a factor in the passing game. He still may score 
occasionally in goal-line packages.  

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 The Broncos will be severely tested by the Jets' passing game this week. 
Vinny Testaverde has been sacked only seven times this season.  

 Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/03/00 
 Anderson will operate as the No. 2 RB behind Terrell Davis this week, but 
should still see some carries as a change-of-pace back.  

 Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/03/00 
 Jackson has lost his starting spot. Derrick Mayes appears healthy for the 
first time this year and will start opposite Sean Dawkins against San Diego.

Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1847&""><B>Jon Kitna</B></A>, QB CIN - The Snake Pit <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/26/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1235&""><B>Keenan McCardell</B></A>, WR JAC - One Man Show <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Ar!

He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=134327&""><B>Stacey Mack</B></A>, RB JAC - Thrill Kill Cult <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1514&""><B>Qadry Ismail</B></A>, WR BAL - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=!

The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=192266&""><B>Jason Brookins</B></A>, RB BAL - Not So Nice Machine <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=187386&""><B>Ron Dayne</B></A>, RB NYG - Not So Nice Machine <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Dayne carried the ball six !

He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=235249&""><B>LaDainian Tomlinson</B></A>, RB SD - The Executioners <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego?s 20-17 loss. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=12375&""><B>Doug Flutie</B></A>, QB SD - Thrill Kill Cult <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he?s only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1003&""><B>Jake Plummer</B></A>, QB ARI - oops, I did it again <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San!
 D!
iego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=133230&""><B>David Boston</B></A>, WR ARI - The Fat Bastards <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He?s one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1234&""><B>Willie Jackson</B></A>, WR NO - The Fat Bastards <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1511&""><B>Joe Horn</B></A>, WR NO - The Lie Downs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He?s been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1140&""><B>Tyrone Wheatley</B></A>, RB OAK - One Man Show <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five t!
im!
es for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - The Guzzlers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=187741&""><B>Tom Brady</B></A>, QB NE - The Executioners <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He?s become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots? bench for another week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1034&""><B>Rich Gannon</B></A>, QB OAK - The Executioners <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1184&""><B>Frank Sanders</B></A>, WR ARI - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Sanders left !

He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1011&""><B>Alex Van Pelt</B></A>, QB BUF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helve!

Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1612&""><B>Oronde Gadsden</B></A>, WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=12363&""><B>Jay Fiedler</B></A>, QB MIA - Meximullets <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and n!

interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=133361&""><B>Donovan McNabb</B></A>, QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1859&""><B>James Thrash</B></A>, WR PHI - The Fat Bastards <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=235213&""><B>Rod Gardner</B></A>, WR WAS - Not So Nice Machine <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jermaine Lewis , WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 With Travis Taylor now out for the season, expect Lewis to line up as the 
second wideout along with Qadry Ismail. Lewis assumed that spot in last 
Sunday's game against Cincinnati and caught four passes for 25 yards. He 
needs to perform well over the season's final weeks to be in the Ravens' 
receiving picture for 2001.  

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Pollard put up decent numbers in Sunday's game at Soldier Field against the 
Bears.  He caught three passes for 42 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss.    

 E.G. Green , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first game back in seven weeks, Green pulled in five passes for 45 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  He may see some increased playing time 
in the offense, and could even spend some time as the Colts' number two 
receiver in the offense.     

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first productive game in weeks, Pathon caught three passes for 58 
yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  Pathon may see more 
looks in the offense in the coming weeks, as Head Coach Jim Mora looks to 
spread the ball around a bit more through the air.     

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/09/00 
 Dilger posted his second consecutive good outing for the Colts this weekend, 
catching five passes for 66 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss to the Bears at 
Soldier Field. He now has 36 receptions for 441 yards and three touchdowns on 
the season.     

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/09/00 
 James complied 117 yards of total offense and scored two touchdowns in last 
Sunday's 27-24 loss to the Bears.  He is now second in the league with 13 
touchdowns, one behind the Rams' Marshall Faulk. He could very well surpass 
Faulk this week against the Jets - he has scored at least one touchdown in 
each of his last four games.        

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Christie kicked his second consecutive game-winning field goal for the Bills 
this week in New England.  He hit on a 48-yarder in the fourth quarter to 
send the game to overtime, then sealed the win with a 32-yard boot in the 
extra session. He kicked three field goals in all, and is now 20-of-23 in 
field goal attempts on the season.       

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 11/09/00 
 McDaniel caught only one pass for 24 yards in Sunday's game against the 
Patriots.  In spite of the poor performance, McDaniel is still second on the 
team in both receptions (27) and receiving yards (443).    

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Price caught three passes for 36 yards in Sunday's win against the 
Patriots.  Although he is on pace to improve on all of his numbers from a 
year ago, Price has been a bust as far as Fantasy owners are concerned.    

 Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Mean Machine Updated 11/09/00 
 The Bills' tight end had a solid Fantasy performance on Sunday, catching six 
passes for 49 yards and a touchdown.  Riemersma has historically had good 
success when Doug Flutie starts for the Bills, so keeping him in the lineup 
this week may be a good idea.     

 Antowain Smith , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith saw his first action in the last six weeks, but got only three carries 
for 13 yards in Sunday's game at Foxboro.  He won't get much playing time for 
the rest of the year, and will likely look to leave Buffalo at the end of the 
season.      

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 11/09/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries in Sunday's game  against  New 
England.  He ran the ball 13 times for 60 yards in Buffalo's 16-13 overtime 
victory.     

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Bradford isn't expected to play Sunday against Tampa Bay after injuring the 
quadriceps muscle near his right knee. The Packers will probably sit Bradford 
and give him time to rest. He is just getting in shape after missing seven 
games this season because of a broken leg. Donald Driver will probably take 
his place as the third receiver.    

 Ahman Green , RB GB - Ramiro Updated 11/09/00 
 Dorsey Levens had arthropscopic surgery on his injured knee Tuesday so Green 
will likely be the starting back for the rest of the season.  He has played 
well in 2000 gaining 474 yards and scoring four touchdowns.  Green still has 
a penchant for fumbling, and has done so three times this season, but he 
managed to hold on to the ball in a rainy game vs. Minnesota Monday.     

 Titans , DT TEN - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 It's highly likely that Tennessee's defense is on a roster in every Fantasy 
league, but you might want to look into acquiring it in a trade for the 
remainder of the season. The Titans' D has four games against some of the 
league's youngest quarterbacks over its final seven games - Spergon Wynn of 
Cleveland twice, and Akili Smith of Cincinnati and Donovan McNabb of 
Philadelphia once.   

 Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Howard is expected to play in Sunday's game against Atlanta.  He sat out 
last week's matchup against the Dolphins due to a neck injury.    

 Derrick Mason , WR TEN - The Snake Pit Updated 11/09/00 
 Receiver and kick returner Mason practiced yesterday despite suffering from 
ankle and back injuries. He is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury 
report for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Sanders was able to practice with the Titans yesterday, and didn't appear to 
be suffering from any effects from a rib cartilage strain that knocked him 
from last Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Tennessee will rely on him if 
Carl Pickens or Yancey Thigpen can't play Sunday against Baltimore.  

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Edinger is finally beginning to settle into the job as the Bears' 
placekicker.  He made 4-of-8 field goals to start the season but has 
connected on his last seven field-goal attempts, including kicks of 41 and 37 
yards last Sunday. Edinger is now 11-of-15 for the season, including 4-of-7 
from beyond the 40.     

 Yancey Thigpen , WR TEN - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Thigpen got a second opinion Tuesday about his injured left ankle, which 
confirmed that he has a condition that will hamper him for the rest of the 
season. He received an injection and was able to practice comfortably 
yesterday, and looks to be on the mend. We'll keep tabs on Thigpen's status 
for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 11/09/00 
 Robinson is on the verge of surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the second 
consecutive season.  Robinson has made seven of the Bears' eight longest 
plays from scrimmage this season, including all five of his touchdown 
receptions. He has catches of 68, 58, 55 and 48 yards from Cade McNown and a 
34-yard TD pass from Jim Miller.   

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/09/00 
 Pickens missed yesterday's practice with his hamstring injury, and the 
Titans are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards his status. He is still 
sore and appears unlikely to post good numbers even if he does play.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Although George was unable to practice yesterday due to a toe injury, Coach 
Jeff Fisher says he would have participated some had the session been 
conducted on grass instead of artificial turf. George is expected to play 
Sunday against Baltimore, although keep in mind that the Ravens have the 
NFL's top-ranked rush defense.  

 Scott Dragos , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Dragos is still suffering from an injured quadriceps and is questionable for 
Sunday's game at Buffalo.  He played a major role as a blocker for James 
Allen when Curtis Enis was inactive.  With Enis back the Bears don't need 
Dragos as much for blocking but may use him as their long snapper.  Regular 
long snapper Pat Mannelly has an injured elbow and is questionable for 
Sunday's game as well.    

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Murder Inc. Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith was limited in practice because of his hamstring and knee injuries, 
but he will return to action Sunday against Seattle. Smith missed 
Jacksonville's last game October 29 against Dallas, but was able to rest over 
the bye week last week.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 McNown is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game at Buffalo.  Head coach Dick 
Jauron said that McNown may be used as the emergency QB if his seperated left 
shoulder continues to improve this week.      

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/09/00 
 The Jaguars will be without linebacker Hardy Nickerson, who underwent 
arthroscopic knee surgery last Friday, for Sunday's game against Seattle. 
Linebackers Lonnie Marts and Brant Boyer, both suffering from groin injuries, 
are listed as questionable on the injury report. Eric Storz and Kevin Hardy 
would be the likely replacements if neither can play. Defensive end Renaldo 
Wynn practiced yesterday and may return to action Sunday after missing four 
games with a torn MCL in his right knee. Defensive tackle Gary Walker will 
play after missing Jacksonville's last game against Dallas October 29.  

 Derek Brown , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The Cardinals re-signed Brown on Wednesday after tight end Jay Tant was lost 
for the season with a torn ACL.  Brown had played for the Cardinals since 
1992 but was cut before the start of this season.      

 Jay Tant , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Tant tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during last 
Sunday's 16-15 win against the Redskins.  He will miss the remainder of the 
season.   

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Patten, who has played sparingly the past three weeks with a turf toe 
injury, is listed as doubtful on the Browns' injury report. He missed 
practice yesterday and is unlikely to make any Fantasy impact Sunday against 
New England.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

CMS tops marketer list in customer satisfaction

Gas Daily 
(c) Copyright 2001 Pasha Publications, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 


The latest customer satisfaction report by Mastio & Co. finds CMS Energy on 
top among 68 of the nation's marketers in areas such as reliability, price 
and ease of business.


Mastio surveyed 1,200 industrials, local distribution companies, electric 
generators, independent power producers, marketers and producers for the 
report, ranking the marketers on 39 customer satisfaction attributes.


The top 20, in order, are: CMS, Reliant, Williams, TXU Energy Trading , Enron 
North America, Southern Co. Energy Marketing , Conoco, Oneok, TransCanada, El 
Paso Energy Marketing , Aquila Energy, PanCanadian Energy Services, BP, Duke 
Energy Trading , Dynegy Marketing & Trade, Exxon Mobil Gas Marketing , Coral 
Energy Resources, Sempra Energy Trading and Koch Energy Trading .


Of those, Reliant Energy had the highest two-year average, while Koch Energy 
Trading had the lowest two-year average. Enron North America and Texaco Gas 
Marketing showed the greatest improvement, while Sempra and Koch showed the 
most significant decline. A total of 43 marketers improved their scores, 
while 27 declined. This is the fourth such index for marketers from St. 
Joseph, Mo.-based Mastio.


""Many marketers focus on the niche customers while ignoring their core 
customers,"" noted Bart Thedinger, vice president/senior partner of Mastio &

144,"Dear Investor,

So far, so good.

My early-October projection of Dow 10,000 by
Thanksgiving came true a few days early.  Now I expect
the market to zigzag its way somewhat higher over the
course of the next two years.

But please, don't go out and ""buy the market.""  Index
funds and the like may make you richer...but they won't
make you truly RICH.  That's because the gap between
winners and losers will be quite large -- in some
cases HUGE -- in the reawakening ahead.

YOU SEE, in some ways the economic and market
pessimists are RIGHT.  Things are different this time
around.  And it's unwise to expect a rising tide that
lifts all boats.  But the right stocks will pay you
handsomely if you buy them now.

The pessimists may rail about Japan's debt load, the
mess in Argentina and Enron's collapse.  But frankly,
my friend, the sky is not all gray.  We're actually
beginning to see some upward earnings revisions.  And
a handful of stocks we own -- like Cendant, SEI
Investments and Harrah's Entertainment -- are already
UP 40%-to-50% from September's lows.  More will
follow.

As you'll discover, the pessimists are WRONG about the
most important issue: We're not headed for some
deflationary death grip or worldwide economic disaster
-- despite the evidence they cite.  Rather we are in
the midst of economic change -- marked by harsh
competition, rapid innovation and hand wringing --
that is a STOCK PICKER'S DREAM.

And in just a moment, I'll share my finely-honed
strategy for market-beating gains -- one that could
easily make you 50% RICHER by the end of the year.

SO PLEASE excuse me if I don't buy all the doom and
gloom.

I respect the intelligence and opinions of the
pessimists.  But for more than 20 years, I've chosen
to go my own way...discover the facts on my own...and
stand up for what I see.

In fact, I visited 18 countries on five continents
last year.  I live part of the year in Europe; just
visited Argentina to size up that situation for
myself; and regularly spend weeks at a time in Greater
China.  Why?  Because like it or not, we truly live in
a global economy.  And by understanding how it works,
I help my clients SAFELY GROW RICH.

HOW?  A time-tested strategy that identifies hot
growth prospects, when the risk of owning them is near
-- or at -- its lowest point.  That's why the
companies I choose span a host of industries, but they
all have four things in common:

1. Financials that show a company solidly in an upward
trend;
2. Management with a laser-like focus on improving the
bottom line;
3. Distinct competitive advantages within its market
niche;
4. And a stock price selling at the low end of its
usual trading range.

THAT'S THE ONLY WAY to invest for low-risk, fortune-
building gains.  And once you join me, I know you'll
agree.

I've just put the finishing touches on my annual list
of ""PROFIT ROCKETS"" for my Investor's World clients
and thought you might want a peek, as well.

In fact, you can get it IMMEDIATELY with a few simple
mouse-clicks -- and 100% RISK-FREE, as well.  Since I
first issued this annual forecast back in 1995, my
clients have really cleaned up -- shouldn't you make a
pile of money this year, too?

From the beginning of 1995 through the end of 2001,
this annual portfolio of ""Profit Rockets"" has racked
up a cumulative gain of 287.5%!  That's over a seven-
year period.  Do the division yourself and see how it
looks.  NOT BAD!  And that time period includes the
worst bear market of the last 25 years -- we were
actually UP another 14% in 2001.

Today, I provide this portfolio solely to my
Investor's World clients.  But I first started making
this ""annual forecast"" in 1995 as a regular panelist
on Wall $treet Week With Louis Rukeyser.

IN 1995, I was #1 among over 20 world-class investors
with gains of 63.3% -- as audited by Bloomberg.  In
1996, I ""slipped"" to #2.  And in 1999, I just missed
out on top honors with a NICE FAT 60.4% GAIN.

And frankly, I've been helping investors like you to
oversized gains for more than twenty years now.

When the pessimists cried that oil was going to $100 a
barrel in the 1980s, I led my clients to the rational
truth and more big profits.  After the crash of 1987,
I debated every pessimist I could find.  And back in
1993 -- with stocks in the dumps and the pessimists
having a field day -- I told clients to buy for the
greatest bull market in history.

I was right each time.  And I'm staking my reputation
-- and my own money -- on the well-considered belief
that I'm right again.

So please, I urge you, try my Investor's World
advisory RISK-FREE.  As soon as you sign up, you'll
get my full list of 10 Profit Rockets for 2002
immediately, online.  Just click here now:

157,"Hola Hermano,

How are you? I have been busy ever since trying to get everything in order
to leave. I think they want to get as much work out of me as possible until
I leave, not that I blame them. It even doesn't make me mad because I
haven't had time to think about it. Anyway the work has also been more
interesting in the last two months than the two before I left for holidays.

I now find myself in peculiar situation similar to maybe going off to
school. I am leaving somewhere where I have made a lot of close friends and
had heaps of great, and trying experiences and am preparing for the next
step in life, oh no a CAREER, ouch that hurts. I however am excited on where
this new road may lead me and as you know man I am ready to come home. I
sure wish you could have been here for the going a way party, it was so
fantastic, other than not getting laid. I am so tired of these foreign know
it all, fascist, snobby, anorexic, egotistical, meniacal, deceptive, nose
ring wearing, no dancing, big shoe sporting, tasteless,  putas! I really
can't wait to meet some nice Texas girls or someone with similar interest.

I miss you a lot too and can't wait to have some nice parties and dinners as
well, I am more of a budding Chef. My guitar playing is getting a little
better. So what's the scoop. Anything happening in work, relationship,
houseshopping, fishing hunting. So what's up there. Mom says you're working
like crazy and occasionally looking for a house. How's that going. I can
tell you, it never fails. No matter where I go I seem to run into decisions
all with the same gravity, I guess if there is third guarantee in life it is
decisions. If you haven't finished by the time I return I would like to help
you

I can't wait! I have had a great time here but I really am ready to return
home. I know now I never wish to permanenetly live outside of Texas. Anyway
I'm so busy packin and taking care of paperwork and contracts and bla bla
bla it takes all my time! My last day of work is Next Wednesday (28th) and
then I will travel and visit some friends for about three weeks. This
weekend, since I'm not at home for Mardi Gras I will go to visit a Thomas in
Cologne Germany and go to one of the greatest Karnival Celebrations in the
world. The following weekend my flatmate David and I are off to Rome and
then Budapest (Hungary). Then the last week (on my home) I will leave Zurich
on the 15th of March and stop off in Den Hague and Amsterdam (Holland) for 6
days to visit Natalie. Well I am not leaving for a while and will constantly
have acces to the internet so write back and let me know how things are
going. All the best on at work and on finding a house und so weiter. By the
way I am searching for some jobs there have you heard from anyone or can I
write to anyone?

Love ya bro,

165,"Enron filed a protest at FERC yesterday in the Midwest proceedings - both Alliance RTO and Midwest ISO as well as the National Grid filing pursuing the role of managing member of Alliance.  We asked the FERC to take immediate action giving specific guidance on the essential aspects of an RTO structure based on the SE mediation report by the ALJ (governance, stakeholder process and congestion management using LMP).  After such guidance we suggested that the order require a collaborative process of all parties to work out the details of an RTO to be fully operational by December 15, 2002.

Enron's request goes further than any of those recently filed at FERC by other parties which ask for the MW to be sent to mediation (much like the SE and NE proceedings).  Enron's pleading argues that the ARTO and MISO TOs and stakeholders already had a mediation-type process which resulted in a settlement.  Enron had been the only party to oppose the settlement on the basis that two MW RTOs would not work out the seams agreements sufficiently to make a single MW market.  The filings show in fact that the ""compatible"" protocols and procedures promised by the settlement have not succeeded in their attempts.  The amorphous agreements to agree by the two RTOs are still just that, lacking the detail necessary to assure a seamless MW market.

The FERC has indicated that it will issue a rehearing order in the Alliance RTO proceeding by November.  It is possible that they will also act on the above pleading in that order.

our expenses.  At this point, we are working on a best, worst and most likely 
case for a revenue model, plus getting some teeth behind our up front costs.  
With this info, we can size the potential and then decide how to proceed.  

My first note to you around disbanding Joel's group was the best overall 
summary of reasons to disband the team.  In addition, Joel and his team had 
recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the 
projects in which they were involved.  The update had the exact opposite 
effect that Joel wanted, I am sure.  After the two hour session, it appeared 
to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth, 
fulfilling IT's roles in some cases, not communicating with the rest of my 
direct report team (if your role is be a liaison, then communication is a 
necessary component of the role), struggling to create a role for themselves, 
etc.  If my reaction had been to say ""what a talented group - we have to 
figure out how to best utilize them"", then the outcome might have been 
different.  But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well.  That two 
hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs 
for the team without commensurate value, that I couldn't in good conscious 
make any other decision after further investigation.  --Sally

197,"Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the 
mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale 
businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around 
mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test 
- i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of 
transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.  
Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of 
explaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does 
happen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we 
believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where 
operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. 

These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which 
Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely 
designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to 
produce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and 
potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that 
are valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage 
success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class 
practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep 
review process would follow this set of steps:

 1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This 
is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be 
notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain 
that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town. 

 2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell 
them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in 
making information and personnel available to complete the review.  

 3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key 
commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and 
key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The 
deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process 
and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  

 4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of 
the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those 
which may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested.  
This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually 
very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support 
their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an 
additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with 
this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support 
the growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office 
know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing 
so. 

 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be 
reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls 
and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, 
assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate 
personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume 
responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and 
to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.  
Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey 
to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, 
doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep 
findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep 
teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each 
doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me 
sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick 
before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular 
concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more 
timely manner than quarterly.   

Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in 
Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors 
in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not 
concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the 
integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were 
discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's 
practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley 
was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted 
Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was 
for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  

Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from 
Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the 
case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I 
know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you 
would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when 
they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as 
a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in 
this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert 
them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the 
level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing 
directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and 
myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the 
download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice 
mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a 
meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me.  
In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona 
mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked 
for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the 
integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control 
which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  

To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the 
heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is 
to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to 
offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire 
Enron organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The 
findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, 
which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to 
""over-wordsmith"" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be 
surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can 
reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical 
perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  

I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with 
you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as 
valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain

have time, I would love to get with you late next week to discuss my thoughts 
about next steps for Joel's team.  --Sally 

Also, when you are back, I would love to set up a meeting with you and some 
of my direct reports so that we can get an update on IT priorities.  We are 
addressing some issues that create operational risk that may require some 
system enhancements to help us mitigate those risks, and we would like the

nice keepsake.  Maybe we can do this.  --Sally

is cold but clear, so I am enjoying it.  Very useful trip - they have my 
schedule very full, including dinners every night.  I will be in the office 
through end of day Thursday, and then dinner with Fernley Thursday night.  I 
will be in route to Houston on Friday - catching a 9:00am flight (told the 
kids that I would be at the airport at 2:00 am Houston time to start back 
home).  

We are not going to follow the Kean/Olson memo on communicating ratings.  We 
will only communicate Needs Improvement and Issues.  There will be differing 
messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need to hear 
that they are not performing at a high enough level relative to peers to help 
us achieve business goals or for them to considered for a bonus (may need to 
find another role within or outside Enron which is a better fit).  Message to 
someone new to Enron in that category should be different.  Glad they are 
here; believe that as they learn the organization and their job that they 
will be able to make significant contributions; doing the right thing to 
learn the business, but that contributions to date are not significant enough 
to warrant payment of a bonus...

on Captiva Island.  

Sorry that I didn't have time to respond to your e:mail from last week.  It 
will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff.  Yes, the bed and 
changing table match -- maple with a small amount of blue (not bright) trim 
on the bed and maple only on the changing table.  Our bedding could probably 
go either way, boy or girl.  If I remember correctly, the bumpers are red 
ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue 
chambray and red bandana trim.  It's not as loud as it sounds - just take a 
look when you are here.  We also have a beautiful cradle (with bedding) for 
you to look at and a great baby swing.  As the baby gets older, we also have 
an entertainer - now takes the place of what we used to call walkers.  

I am mailing you a Martha Stewart magazine on babies (yes, she does those, 
too!), as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items 
in them.  

Yes, good news on Dad.  I hope that in the next few weeks that his medication 
will kick in and he will see some improvement.  It is highly likely that the 
infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had.  It is just 
great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started.  I think 
that he dodged a bullet on this one.  

We will look forward to seeing you and Chris for Thanksgiving.  No big plans 
yet.  I assume that everyone will be here by at least Wednesday night.  I 
have ordered a birthday cake from RJ Goodies to help celebrate all November 
birthdays that evening.  Am hoping that Mom and Dad may come over on Tuesday 
so that we can do some fun things on Wednesday during the day (always a great 
day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for Thanksgiving!).  I 
will have the whole week off from work.  The kids are off starting on 
Wednesday.  It is possible that on Friday, David, Amanda and Tyler may drive 
to Longview to have a visit with his mom and family.  If you can stay, we

However, there are a few things remanded to the EPA for review and it's 
possible this along with the delay associated with these remands could cause 
a delay in implementation.  I'm also picking up from EPA sources that there

230,"Hello Everyone,

	Well, this week was no doubt a tough week for us all picking the winners. Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week. Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game. Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville. In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong. Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points. Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win. George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored. There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62. 

	There is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon. I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win. Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2. If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it. I do not want to go more than $3 for now. Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars. This is not my idea to have some people give up more money, but just a suggestion I got from a few people. 
Below are the number of games missed by each person this week.

The response from those execs that have seen the demo is very favorable!  They think that it is a great tool.  

All have expressed a concern about who can access the data and we have completed a security enhancement that allows us to ""firewall"" PortRAC by business unit.  We are working with each business unit to get a list of their approved users.

285,"Hi Larry,

Since it's been a month since we emailed you our list of recommendations, we 
wanted to check back with you and see if there is anything we can do to help 
you with your diamond buying decision? Our goal is to help you make an 
informed decision that you will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, 
since we don't own these stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants 
who will work to find the very best diamond for you at a great price.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

P.S.
If you have already purchased, please let us know in a reply to this message 
so we will know not to send any more follow up messages.

10. Keep telling the same person they have bad breath
      even if they don't, and then punch them in the face.

  9. Announce in a meeting that you have AIDS. After
      everyone gives you the sympathy remarks, tell everyone
      you were kidding and call them a bunch of queers.

  8. Before a meeting, fill your mouth with custard. In the
     meeting pretend you're hocking up a loogie, spit it into
      a glass and hand it to the person next to you and say
      ""BEAT THAT!""

  7. Inform a male co-worker that he would make a good
      hooker, then piss in his coffee and tell him he needs a
      good ass fucking.

   6. Always walk around with a big smile and keep one hand
       down the front of your pants.

   5. Answer every question with "" Fucked if I know..."",
       then call the person a racial slur that doesn't even match
       their race

   4. Brag about the fact that you carry a gun, and keep
       playing with your nuts. Get them really sweaty and go
       around shaking everyone's hand.

    3. Run down the hall with your dick out spraying piss
        everywhere yelling ""It wont stop! God help me it wont
        stop!"" Then when it does, look down and say, ""Oh! I must have
        broke it.""

     2. Ask to borrow a co-worker's expensive pen- Bring it
         to the bathroom and stick it up your ass- return it to
         the person and tell them that it smells bad and tell them to
         smell it- when they say that it smells, say ""It should - - I
had it up
         my ass!""

     1. Shit on your office floor and when someone comes in
         and sees it tell them it's the fake rubber kind. When they try
         to pick it up and realize that their hand is full of real shit

recent agency inspection of the TW Atoka No. 3 C/S.  Due to the agenciy's 
portable testing of units at the AToka No. 2 and 3 C/S, A plan was developed

discussed was NSPS fuel gas monitoring for nitrogen and sulfur and other 
miscellaneous air issues.  

Texaco has initiated soil excavation of an abondoned pit which may be the 
source of groundwater contamination at the NNG Eunice C/S.  An Enron  
contractor is onsite to oversee the activities by Texaco and to assist in the 
results of the investigation.

The 3rd request to Region VI EPA was completed requesting approval of 5 
Transwestern and 1 NNG facilities for custom fuel monitoring schedules.  
Initial requests dating back to 10/8/98 were included with the packet.  A

Pending additional lack of response,   a meeting will be requested to the 
agency requesting action and approval of the requests.

Dear Larry,

Everyone has their own definition of paradise. For some it's

developed resort. For others, it's not about the outdoors at all--if 
you're one of those people who thinks a place called ""Sin City""

""in-person"" because of a scheduling conflict with a sub-working group
meeting to discuss metering for the EDRP.  This status report is available
on the NYISO Web Site under April 24 BIC Meeting Materials and it is my
understanding that Garry Brown directed market participants to read that
presentation and contact Wes Yeomans or attend a BAWG meeting with

The last slide in that presentation did require action from the BIC
pertaining to direction on what to use for generation payments when the
NYISO orders a generator on line but the generator bid price expired.

322,"I received a call from a permit engineer with the Arizona Dept. of 
Environmental Quality (ADEQ) concerning the issue of notification of 
mechanical activities at C/S 2  Flagstaff and a mandatory 7 day wating period 
for agency review and approval.   Due to the urgency of the C/S 2 work being 
performed, I had written a notification to the agency friday evening 
requesting approval to initiate the activities detailed in the scope of work 
which was included with the letter.  On Monday, the engineer called and said 
that he had read the letter and had no problems with the activity proceeding 
at the C/S.  After we had discussed this issue at some length, I posed the 
question to him of whether it was necessary to notify the agency of 
mechanical and maintenace activities which  will not impact or change a 
combustion units throughput, fuel use, emissions, horsepower, or cause a 
change in design.  After some discussions I informed him that Transwestern 
will probably inundate the agency with notification letters, he stated that 
as long as the engines operating parameters would not change, ( horsepower, 
emissions, throughput, fuel use etc), and the burden of responsibility will 
rest on Transwestern to ensure that no permit conditions are violated, he 
stated that we may proceed with these types of activities in Arizona without 
any notification to the agency.   

The only hitch being, that when Transwestern does a major mechanical 
activity, which would cost more than  25-30% of the cost of replacing a unit, 
that we provide them a courtesy notification.  I told them we would apprise 
them of such an activity.....

329,"Larry, per your request following our phone conversation today I'm forwading 
a brief note regarding our dinner meeting last night with the Arizona Chapter 
of the Nature Conservancy.  

Hank Hull (Flagstaff Team leader) and I met with Edward Smith, the Northern 
Arizona Program Ecologist with the Nature Conservancy, here out of 
Flagstaff.  The purpose of the meeting was to make introductions between Ed 
and Hank and to informally discuss opportunities in which the Flagstaff Team 
could support the local chapter.  The Flagstaff Team made a committment in 
their Team Objectives and each team member in their Peer Committments to 
support the Conservancy in some manner this year.  To date all eight of the 
Flagstaff Team members (2 positions currently vacant) have taken advantage of 
the free membership offered through ETS.  Also, Ed was quite impressed with 
ETS's sponsorship of the employee and family memberships.  I won't get into 
the details but, it was obvious that opportunities will exist for the Team to 
become active in local activities.  So, as a follow up to the meeting, Ed 
will make a list of the areas and locations the Conservancy is in need of 
help and forward this list to Hank who will then poll the various Team 
members and solicit volunteers.  This may take a couple of weeks to get up 
and running but we should be well on our way by June.  Our goal, for now, 
will be to committ on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis to providing a 
given number of volunteer hours.  I'll keep you posted on how things 
progress.  

Ed also, offered to come out to one of the Team's meetings and give the group 
an overview of the Arizona Chapter of the Nature Conservancy and discuss our 
involvement with the entire Team.  And last but not least, when you, Bill, 
John, Rich and Randy come out for your West End field trip we may be able to 
coordinate a dinner get togeather with Ed to discuss any topics of interest.

344,"The answer to your question is that all emissions reported on the emissions 
inventory should be included in the calculation of emissions fees. This leads 
to another question-what emissions should be reported on the emissions 
inventory?

I discussed this issue with a TNRCC emissions inventory team leader. He 
informed me that that is no written guidance on how to report upset, 
maintenance, start-up, and shutdown emissions on the emissions inventory, and 
as a result be included in emission fees. He did indicate that at previous 
emissions inventory workshops, attendees were verbally told to only include 
""reportable"" (emissions that exceed RQ) on their inventories, and not  
""recordable"" (non-reportable) emissions. He also mentioned that one ton/year 
would also be an acceptable threshold for including emissions in the 
inventory.

He is aware that  upset, maintenance, start-up, and shutdown emissions are an 
important issue, now that they are included in fees. He indicated that TNRCC 
will be putting out definitive information on this issue in future emissions 
inventory workshops and guidance, in preparation for submittal of calendar 
year 2001 inventories that will be due in 2002.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

10. Keep telling the same person they have bad breath
      even if they don't, and then punch them in the face.

  9. Announce in a meeting that you have AIDS. After
      everyone gives you the sympathy remarks, tell everyone
      you were kidding and call them a bunch of queers.

  8. Before a meeting, fill your mouth with custard. In the
     meeting pretend you're hocking up a loogie, spit it into
      a glass and hand it to the person next to you and say
      ""BEAT THAT!""

  7. Inform a male co-worker that he would make a good
      hooker, then piss in his coffee and tell him he needs a
      good ass fucking.

   6. Always walk around with a big smile and keep one hand
       down the front of your pants.

   5. Answer every question with "" Fucked if I know..."",
       then call the person a racial slur that doesn't even match
       their race

   4. Brag about the fact that you carry a gun, and keep
       playing with your nuts. Get them really sweaty and go
       around shaking everyone's hand.

    3. Run down the hall with your dick out spraying piss
        everywhere yelling ""It wont stop! God help me it wont
        stop!"" Then when it does, look down and say, ""Oh! I must have
        broke it.""

     2. Ask to borrow a co-worker's expensive pen- Bring it
         to the bathroom and stick it up your ass- return it to
         the person and tell them that it smells bad and tell them to
         smell it- when they say that it smells, say ""It should - - I
had it up
         my ass!""

     1. Shit on your office floor and when someone comes in
         and sees it tell them it's the fake rubber kind. When they try
         to pick it up and realize that their hand is full of real shit

The 600K is salary, and nonperformance related bonus payouts.  It is NOT guaranteed bonus over and above salary (I wish it was).  Basically, I am 95% certain I will make a minimum of 600K/year with either company, worst case I'm looking at 500K/year (excluding incentive).  Incentive would be in addition to.  My offer would have to be in that ballpark.  If I worked 1/3 the year, assuming a base salary in the 250 to 300 range, I would get 100 less.  Also, I'm not trying to be vague.  Essentially I'm working with 3 moving parts--non of which has become crystal clear yet.  At this point, let's look at this:  2-year contract with an out after 1-year.  $275 base salary.  $225 signing bonus.  $225 retention bonus after 1-year.  If I take it, I'm done for another year.  Participation in the 17% incentive package.  Relocation package.  That seems to be the ballpark we are in.

Thanks,

technical conference to address current and projected interstate natural gas 
pipeline capacity to California, as well as the adequacy of the natural gas 
infrastructure within California.  This notice establishes the date for the 
conference and the procedures by which interested parties can seek to 
participate in it.  
DATES: The conference will be held May 24, 2001.  Those interested in making 
presentations or participating in discussions should indicate their interest 
by May 14, 2001 by a letter addressed to the Secretary, Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission.

(MORE DETAIL FROM NOTICE)
California Natural Gas Transportation    Docket No. PL01-4-000
 Infrastructure     


NOTICE OF STAFF TECHNICAL CONFERENCE

(May 3, 2001)

 Take notice that the staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will 
hold a public conference on Thursday, May 24, 2001, to address issues 
regarding the natural gas transportation infrastructure with respect to 
California.  The conference will begin at 10:00 a.m., at the Commission's 
offices, 888 First Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20426.  All interested 
persons are invited to attend.

 As Commission staff has dealt with various aspects of the current energy 
situation in California, questions have arisen regarding current and 
projected interstate natural gas pipeline capacity to California, as well as 
the adequacy of the natural gas infrastructure within California.  Commission 
staff is interested in the views of natural gas transporters, producers, 
consumers, regulators, and other interested parties with respect to issues 
including:

 1) current and projected interstate pipeline capacity to California;

2) current and projected capacity of California intrastate pipelines and 
other      natural gas infrastructure;

 3) physical and operational interconnection between the interstate and 
intrastate                 transportation systems; 

 4) current and projected California demand for natural gas; and

 5) how intrastate capacity in California is allocated.

The conference will not include the discussion of any ongoing proceedings 
before the  Commission.

 The conference will be organized in two stages.  The first stage will 
consist of presentations of factual information on the topics listed above.  
The second stage will consist of discussion on the topics.
3


 Persons interested in making presentations or participating in any 
discussion should indicate their interest no later than May 14, 2001 by a 
letter addressed to the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 
First Street, NE, Washington, D.C., 20426, and should refer to Docket No. 
PL01-4-000.  Each request to participate must include a contact person, 
telephone number, and E-mail address.

 Each request must also indicate whether the person is interested in making a 
presentation or participating in discussion.  For those interested in making 
presentations, the request should indicate what topics the presentation will 
cover.  Because of the potential need to limit the number of presentations, 
those with common interests are encouraged to choose a single spokesperson.

 After receipt of the requests, staff may issue a subsequent notice setting 
forth the conference format, or may inform participants of the format at the 
beginning of the conference.  Depending on the number of presentations, it 
may be necessary for staff to contact presenters prior to the conference to 
coordinate the presentations.

Dabhol lenders to vote today on PPA PPPPA termination

The 25-odd lenders to the Dabhol power project will vote today on whether the 
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) should be allowed to to serve a 
preliminary PPA termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB). The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing 
the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian 
lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of 
India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they 
will not be able to block the move.
Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in 
favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 
25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone 
conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. 
Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not 
participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries 
including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and 
OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. ""In the first round, Indian lenders put 
their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. 
Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian 
lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign 
lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice,"" said a source. The 
Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and 
cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore 
worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is 
complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the 
Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K 
Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a 
meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen 
that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal 
to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The 
domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is 
terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.

SAO PAULO (AFX) - Enron Corp will suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the 
Brazilian energy sector, news agency JB Online quoted Enron vice-president 
and Eletricidade e Servicos SA Elektro chairman Orlando Gonzales as saying. 
Of the total investment, 500 mln usd was to be assigned to the expansion of 
the thermoelectric plant Cuiaba II in the state of Mato Grosso, and in the 
construction of Rogen in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with the remainder to 
be invested in unit Elektro, it said.
""There are no clear regulations for the sector. Regulatory issues are holding 
back investments,"" JB Online quoted Gonzales as saying. 
Gonzales said the decision to suspend the investments may be reconsidered if 
the energy sector regulator Aneel establishes clearer regulations.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a 
statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or 
about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to 
meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. 
Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , 
proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.
Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its 
transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. 
In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it 
would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that 
will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. 
The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or 
enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement 
said. 
SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in 
central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate 
transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to 
over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. 
The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas 
pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump 
because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for 
construction. 
Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. 
And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern 
River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave 
Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, 
Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.
At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that ""industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia."" 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX

05/15/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made 
with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), 
whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading 
system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas 
Price Indices. 
NGX acquired the AECO ""C"" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot 
gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. 
last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the 
establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions 
conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues 
to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.
Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, ""We believe that inclusion of data 
from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North 
America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and 
integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which 
removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after 
reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we 
recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that 
""more is better"". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline 
system should improve the quality of our price indices even further."" 
Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, ""We are very 
pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive 
source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price 
indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline 
will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices."" 
The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by 
Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and 
Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action 
against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. 
NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by 
August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to 
the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant 
contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The 
methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be 
on a weighted-average basis. 
NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index 
Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com. 
NGX located in Calgary, Canada provides electronic trading and clearing 
services to natural gas buyers and sellers at seven markets in Canada. Over

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 
billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the 
U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a 
United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. 
Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the 
project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.
Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans 
to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore 
North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. 
Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while 
UOG owns the remaining 51%. 
Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas 
transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government 
would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. 
However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put 
up the money itself. 
Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay 
significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will
operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing
natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are 
scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 
2005. 

Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners 
haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on 
the price of the pipeline. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an 
initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full 
agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.

Changes
1.  I have included a toggle switch that changes between the 500kW and above 
view and the 20kW and above view for the non-core (sophisticated) customers.
2.  I have also included the change in the financing of the Past Utility 
costs to spread them between both core and non-core customers to approach a 
.31 cents per kW price for SCE. (this can also toggle between the previous

requirement in their Rule 21.  At the time they said they ""could"" not
because the construct of their standby rate did not provide adequately
provide recovery for standby service (particularly for non-demand related
tariff schedules).  The rejection was were we left the subject with SCE.
Their move to submit an advice letter on the subject comes as a surprise
to me given their prior response.

We will not be protesting with the presumption that the standby tariff
would not prejudice future work on standby tariff rate design.  Generally
speaking, the QF requirement is ridiculous and should be removed
immediately.  For this reason, we are supportive of it happening now
through this advice filing.  I do not want to see the prohibition against

447,"Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon 
of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the 
""core/noncore"" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to 
brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution 
for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in 
legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the ""Plan B"" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) 
will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is ""comprehensive,"" a complete legislative package will 
be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., 
core/noncore, ""Plan B,"" Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address 
(e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is 
what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a ""conference committee,"" 
comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a 
comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to 
the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue 
its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue 
requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be 
suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to 
review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 
15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a ""thought piece"" on Monday the 9th and 
will use reactions to the ""thought piece"" to craft the develop the proposed 
decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of 
the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the 
Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.",Joe Dutra Joe Nation Edison MOU Hertzberg,,Hertzberg the CA Assembly Assembly Legislature PUC DWR Direct Access Commission

This is from Bill Sonnenschein, the instructor for E291B-1 Speaking for
Management.


Hello all.

And welcome in advance.

I want to pass on some information to you to prepare you for the first
class session.  Class will meet on February 3 & 24, 2001, from 9:00 a.m. to
6:00 p.m.  The time is very short for a speech course.  I am asking you to
prepare a little before the first session, to assure you get as much as you
can out of the course.

Please come to the first day of class with a prepared persuasive speech (a
speech that moves the audience to action).  The speech should be three to
five minutes in length, and on a topic you feel very strongly about.  I do
not care if the topic concerns business.  It could be political, social,
moral, or even spiritual.  The most important thing is that you believe
strongly in the message.  Leaders must learn to speak ""from the heart.""
The focus of the course will be on speaking in a business context, but it
is important to speak with feeling first, and learn to transfer that skill
to a business context.   I do not care if you write the speech out, or
create an outline and rehearse giving the speech extemporaneously.  The
idea is to be prepared.  I will talk about delivering from a manuscript as
well as the advantages of extemporaneous speaking as part of one lecture.

You may also want to buy a blank video tape.  You will not need it till the
second Saturday, and even then using it will be optional.  Videotaping
speeches is an excellent learning tool, but can be counter-productive if
students get too nervous doing it.  I never use tape the first class
session, and you choose if you want to be taped the second session.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 510-336-1239, or

Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)

     (Adds comment from CFO Fastow in fourth paragraph, Enron's
short-term borrowing rates in seventh paragraph.)

     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest
energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million
loan, ensuring access to credit if the embattled company is cut
off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter.

     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its
finances. The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75
percent this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends
on a $3 billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to
finance day-to-day operations.

     Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service placed all $13
billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for
possible downgrade. As a second-tier commercial paper borrower,
any drop in its rating may cut off Enron from the commercial paper
market and raise the costs of short-term debt.

     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.
He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,
giving it enough cash to operate normally.

     Enron shares rose as much as 12.6 percent during the call to
$23.25. They pared the gain to $21.80, up $1.15.

     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,
declined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, declined
to comment.

                      Commercial Paper Rates

     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until
Oct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade.

     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and
advice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the
company on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-
fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along
with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion
loan.

     Earlier this week, an investor sued Enron, saying two
partnerships cost the company $35 million and Fastow's leadership
of them was a conflict of interest.

     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by Fastow. Dismantling some of the partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors.

     Enron created partnerships and affiliated companies to buy
and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its
books.

     Investors said they were concerned that Enron may be forced
to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in
cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he may have
to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies if Enron's
debt ratings fall too far.

Enron CFO: Company Has Sufficient Liquidity
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/23/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the company had procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest in dealings between Enron and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the Houston energy trading company to provide additional information about the partnerships, which Enron said were off-balance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market.
In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a ""Chinese wall"" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. 
The procedures were ""rigorously followed,"" Lay said. 
In previous filings with the SEC, Enron said the terms of the transactions with the partnerships were ""reasonable compared to those which could have been negotiated with unrelated third parties."" 
Fastow resigned from the partnerships, which were known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investments LP in late July. 
The company also is involved in other off-balance sheet financing vehicles, including Marlin Water Trust II and Whitewing. 
During the conference call, investors said they were frustrated by the complex nature of the trusts, and asked for more information. 
Lay said the company would be providing a list of ""Frequently Asked Questions"" on its Web site later Tuesday that may provide more details. 
After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. 
Lay said he was ""extremely disappointed"" in the current stock price. 
""Our businesses are performing very well and we are continuing to conduct business,"" he said. 

During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships. 
Enron officials also addressed concerns that investors had about the potential need to issue additional Enron stock. 
Under certain circumstances, for example, if both Enron's stock and credit rating fall to certain levels, the company would need to issue additional shares to the partnerships, diluting the holdings of current shareholders. 
Enron officials declined to say how much dilution would occur under a ""worst-case scenario."" 
However, the officials said they doubted there would be a need to issue the additional stock because the company plans to work with the credit-rating agencies to prevent such an event. 
Moody's put Enron on watch for a downgrade of its long-term debt last week after the company announced a $1 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 million loss. 
According to Lay, Enron's debt rating would need to fall several notches to below investment grade in order to trigger the need to issue more stock. 
""We are committed to maintaining our ratings,"" Lay said. ""Moody's said they would work with us,"" he added. 
Furthermore, Fastow said, Enron expects to have ""sufficient liquidity"" to meet all its capital requirements. 

Enron's efforts to unwind the LJM partnerships contributed to a reduction of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. However, Enron's Lay said the lower number of shares outstanding wouldn't affect the company's earnings outlook. 
Enron has said it expects to earn $1.80 a share in 2001 and $2.15 a share in 2002. The numbers are in line with the consensus estimates reported by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
""Despite the economy going softer, we think we can meet that,"" Lay said.

469,"Hi,
Good work Jeff.  Dunn would think twice after receiving it.  The
following are some general comments about the letter, which makes some
excellent points.  First, I think the letter should go to all Senators
individually, by name.  Perhaps a more productive approach may be to
point out to them  that they should clearly understand the ramifications
of what they are voting on when they vote on the contempt order (rather
than point out to Dunn the error of his ways).  Rather than focus on
Dunn's committee, maybe we lay out the facts of the negotiation that led
us to court and urge them to consider them before they take this
historic vote.  We can still say we weren't part of the original 1890
problem and we're only an infintesimal part of the current problem.  But
from there we should ask them to stand up for due process and civil
rights and use the arguments in the letter to support why they ought to
reject the contempt order.  Using liberal arguments to a democrat
audience makes some sense in this regard, but we might need help from
Sanders on the civil libertarian arguments that sell best.

An interesting opening might be:  Several politicians in California have
confided to Enron representatives over the course of the last several
months that politics is a ""blame game"", and unfortunately Enron makes an
excellent target.  While we at Enron understand the need to blame
outsiders when things go wrong, we believe that you will be going much
further than blaming if you vote to place Enron in contempt of the
Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the
Wholesale Energy Market. You will, in fact, be eroding the basic
protections afforded citizens bla, bla,, bla.

Its late in the day and I'm leaving for a short break tomorrow so I'm
rambling.  But you get my idea.  Ignore at will.   I won't be checking
e-mail until Aug. 13th but my cell phone may be working at the farm in

Under the definition of ""Spot Market Service"" it now reads:

This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or Term Service. 

I don't understand the meaning of the phrase ""or be deemed to elect.""  If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be deleted.

There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term.
Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a ""zone of comfort"" around including those numbers.  That may become an issue (and may not, just wanted to briefly flag it).

CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers.

Enron's Azurix to rescind Buenos Aires province water/sewage contract

BUENOS AIRES (AFX) - Enron Corp water and sewage unit Azurix Buenos Aires SA said it will rescind its concession to provide Buenos Aires province with water and sewage services. 
Azurix Latin America chief executive officer John Garrison met with Buenos Aires province Governor Carlos Ruckauf and provincial Public Works Minister Julian Dominguez yesterday to lay out the company's withdrawal.
Azurix sent a letter to the provincial government at the end of July claiming the concession was not economically feasible and calling on the provincial government to comply with a public works program outlined in the concession. 
Daily El Cronista reported the company paid 300 pct over the second bidder to win the license, due to ""poor advice from a consulting firm."" 
On not receiving a reply to its letter from the government, the company has by contract the right to unilaterally call off the concession. 
Daily El Dia reported that the company will sue the province of Buenos Aires for breach of contract for a sum of up to 400 mln usd. 
It said if the province is found at fault, it would have to repay Azurix its contract warranty, as well as an indemnity for damages and lost profits and on the unamortized value of its investment and property. 
If Azurix is found at fault, the province would still have to pay the for unamortized value of investment and property.

Prime minister says he expects quick resolution of dispute with Enron

09/07/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW DELHI, India (AP) - India's prime minister said Friday there would be a quick settlement of U.S.-based Enron Corp.'s dispute with a state utility over payment of dlrs 21.7 million in electricity charges. 
Atal Bihari Vajpayee's assurance came after the Dabhol Power Corp., the Indian subsidiary of Houston-based Enron, served an arbitration notice on the Indian government for the recovery of money owed by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.
The state utility hasn't paid for the electricity bought in December from Enron's 2,184 megawatt power plant in western India. 
""The central government, in cooperation with Maharashtra state government, financial institutions and other partners, will facilitate an early and amicable resolution of the vexatious problem surrounding the Dabhol power project,"" Press Trust of India news agency quoted Vajpayee as saying. 
U.S. officials have said American business leaders are wary of investing in India unless the Enron dispute is settled. 
Vajpayee had held a meeting Friday of the government's Advisory Council on Trade and Industry in New Delhi. 
The power plant stopped operations in May after the state electricity board, its sole customer, canceled a seven-year-old power purchase agreement. Enron says the board didn't have the right to cancel the agreement. 
The Vajpayee government had provided guarantees that it would meet the obligations of the state utility if it defaulted on payment. 
The state utility says the coal- and gas-fired plants could produce electricity at around 4 cents per kilowatt hour, while Enron's naphtha plant has been charging nearly 14 cents. 
Enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in the dlrs 3 billion Dabhol Power Co. project for a minimum of dlrs 1 billion. The state utility holds a 15 percent stake, and General Electric Co. and Bechtel Corp. each have a 10 percent stake.

EOTT to Convert Enron, Koch Shares Into Common Units (Update2)

EOTT to Convert Enron, Koch Shares Into Common Units (Update2)

     (Adds analyst's comment in sixth paragraph and details on
debt refinancing in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Sept. 7 (Bloomberg) -- EOTT Energy Partners LP, a
crude oil-marketing and pipeline company, said it will convert
stakes in the partnership held by Enron Corp. and Koch Petroleum
Group LP into 4.3 million publicly traded units with a value of
about $86 million.

     After the conversion, EOTT's general partner, EOTT Energy
Corp., will increase annual payments to common unit holders to
$1.95 from $1.90, the company said in a statement. Two-thirds of
the holders must approve the conversion plan.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, will convert 7 million
subordinated units and all of its $9.3 million in partnership
interests into common units, EOTT spokeswoman Gina Taylor said.
Koch Petroleum, a unit of Koch Industries Inc., will convert
2 million subordinated units Enron then will own 3.4 million
common units, and Koch will own 900,000, Taylor said.

     Enron doesn't plan to sell the units ``at this time,'' Taylor
said.

     Enron and EOTT are based in Houston. Koch, the second-biggest
closely held U.S. company, is based in Wichita, Kansas.

     Enron might sell its stake in EOTT, though it's probably
waiting for a higher unit price, Dain Rauscher Wessels analyst
Mark Easterbrook said. EOTT has been selling some assets and
adding new ones to improve cash flow and increase payouts to
unitholders, he said.

     ``The timing of the . . . conversion really isn't related to
the timing of a potential sale,'' he said. ``I think it's more the
fact that they've got the partnership where they want it.''
     Units of EOTT rose $1.09 to $21.20, a 52-week high. On June
30, EOTT had 27.5 million common units.

     Enron's shares rose $1.08 to $31.57.

     EOTT plans to issue equity and long-term debt to refinance
short-term debt from a $117 million acquisition of pipelines and
storage terminals in June. It also plans to replace a $1 billion
credit facility.



IDBI's Vohra on Buyers for Enron Indian Power Venture: Comment
2001-09-07 11:22 (New York)


     Mumbai, Sept. 7 (Bloomberg) -- P.P. Vohra, the new chairman
of the Industrial Development Bank of India, speaks on finding
buyers for Enron Corp.'s $3 billion power project in the country.
He was speaking to reporters after a meeting between officials of
financial institution and the government. IDBI is one of the
lenders to the project.

     ``Financial institutions have been asked (by the government)
to talk to stakeholders, including the primary stakeholder
(Enron), and look for various acceptable buyers. There are several
of them.

     ``The (potential) buyers are all Indian. We will meet to
decide who it will be. We will meet finance ministry officials in
three weeks'' time.

     Enron wants to exit Dabhol Power Co., as it is owed $64
million by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, in unpaid bills. The board in May stopped buying power
from the Enron unit, saying it's too expensive.

     Enron has offered to sell to the government its stake in the
power project, India's biggest foreign investment, at cost. Enron,
the top energy trader, said it has invested $875 million in the
project.

     IDBI and other Indian banks have most at stake. They've lent
$1.4 billion to the project without government guarantees. The
$600 million lent by ABN Amro, Bank of America Corp., and other
overseas banks is covered by guarantees.

     Ajit Kumar, secretary in the ministry of finance, said he met
lenders to try and resolve the eight-month-old dispute.

     ``We had detailed discussions on a large number of aspects,
which need further examination between various ministries and the
government of Maharashtra,'' he said.



USA: Enron must give documents to Calif. lawmakers-judge.

09/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee probing charges of price gouging during the state's energy crisis, a California judge ruled on Thursday. 
But Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi also ruled lawmakers must provide Enron with a confidentiality agreement, saying he was not convinced the committee would respect the firm's right to maintain proprietary secrets.
""If the committee could take the requested action in the name of the public interest, then the committee ostensibly could require newspapers to surrender their confidentiality rights, attorneys to surrender their attorney-client privilege, (and) psychiatrists to surrender their privileges,"" the judge wrote. 
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation has subpoenaed documents from a number of energy firms to probe accusations California power agencies and utilities were overcharged some $8.9 billion for wholesale electricity during the state's energy crisis which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold. 
Independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the state's poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough power plants to meet the growing needs of its 34 million residents and its industries. 
An Enron spokeswoman said on Thursday the firm has already turned over tens of thousands of documents, but wanted assurances that certain sensitive documents containing proprietary trade secrets, for example, would be protected under a confidentiality agreement. 
The firm will now work with the committee to hammer out the specifics of such an agreement, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. 
""We are pleased with the judge's order in that he agreed that our constitutional right would be protected,"" Denne said. ""The issue has always been protecting the confidential documents."" 
The committee has already asked the full Senate to cite Enron as well as Reliant Energy Inc. for contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential documents. It would be the first such citation imposed by the state Senate since 1929, but has not yet come up for a vote. 
Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. however, avoided the contempt threat by agreeing with legislators' demands to sign confidentiality agreements, open a document depository close to Sacramento, and begin placing documents there relating to the company's recent business in California.

Enron Documents in California Electricity Probe Win Protection
2001-09-06 18:00 (New York)

Enron Documents in California Electricity Probe Win Protection

     Sacramento, California, Sept. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
the world's largest energy trader, received a protective order for
documents subpoenaed by a California state Senate committee.

     Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi ruled that
Enron can prevent the legislative panel from sharing information
in the thousands of documents relating to energy trading in
California. Legislators subpoenaed the information earlier this
year.

     ``Once the confidential information is disclosed, no amount
of sanctions will be able to rectify the damage that might be
caused,'' Kobayashi wrote in his order.

     The Senate committee requested documents including e-mails,
phone logs, financial records and records of any Enron ``trading
strategies.'' The panel is probing whether generators manipulated
the power market. Soaring wholesale prices last year left
utilities unable to buy power, and the state began purchasing
energy on their behalf.

     Houston-based Enron had argued that the Senate sought
confidential information, including trade secrets, that could be
shared with the state's own energy-buying agency. That would
create an unfair advantage for California power buyers, Enron
said.

     Enron and members of the Senate panel will now meet to craft
the protective order, then submit it to Kobayashi for approval,
said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.

     The committee has subpoenaed almost 20 companies and agencies
as part of its investigation.

Attached, please find our FC note discussing the report issued by the FERC
ALJ following the refund settlement conference, which concluded on Monday.

 <<IPPupdate071301.pdf>>

Summary:
1. On July 12, Curtis Wagner, the Administrative Law Judge who presided over
the recent FERC settlement conference, issued a report presenting his
findings and recommendations on next steps.  Overall, the report was very
much consistent with our expectations.

2. Wagner notes that large refunds are due from the generators.  However, he
argues that the $8.9 billion amount demanded by the State of California
""cannot be substantiated.""  Rather, ultimate refunds will likely approach
and perhaps exceed a mere $1 billion.   Further, Wagner indicates that
amounts owed to the generators likely exceed any refunds that may be due.
As such, cash refunds, which have been demanded by California Governor Gray
Davis, cannot be justified.

3. Wagner's recommendations focus less on quantifying refunds due and more
on the appropriate methodology and procedures FERC should adopt in arriving
at a final decision.  In terms of methodology, Wagner argues that with some
modification FERC should apply its June 19 market mitigation order, which
called for 24 hour floating price caps, on a retroactive basis to October 2,
2000.  From a procedural perspective, Wagner recommends that FERC order a 60
day evidentiary hearing to resolve the significant factual disputes between
the State of California and the generators and other power sellers.

4. Litmus Test: Impact on Forward Earnings   Our view is that the market's
litmus test for evaluating recent political and regulatory events must focus
on their impact on forward earnings, returns and growth rates.  It is
important to remember that while the prospect of refunds creates some
uncertainty, this issue has absolutely no bearing on the forward earnings
prospects for any of the California IPPs-AES, CPN, MIR, NRG, and RRI.

5. CPN and MIR are Best Positioned   In our view, Strong Buy rated Calpine
and Buy rated Mirant face the least exposure with respect to the refund
issue.  In the case of Calpine, recent press reports indicate that the
company is close to a bilateral settlement with the State of California,
which would resolve all outstanding issues with regard to retroactive
refunds.  We believe this settlement could be forthcoming over the next 2
weeks.  Such an announcement would be an important catalyst for the stock.
In the case of Mirant, while the company had been involved in the spot
market over the past 12 months, the company has reserved about $295 million
(75%) against its past receivables.  We regard this action as highly
conservative, providing MIR considerable downside protection.

Regards,

Neil Stein   212/325-4217

Per our discussions I am writing this note to formally request a regulatory 
opinion regarding the status and possible outcomes with respect to QF PPA 
restructuring in California.  As we discussed, ENA is currently conducting 
due diligence efforts on 2 California QF assets; Mt. Poso and Ace.  Both of 
these assets have SO4 PPAs.  Mt. Poso's is with PG&E and Ace's is with 
Edison.    By the time we acquire these assets, both will be receiving SRAC 
energy prices.  As part of this process, we need to be able to quantify (as 
best we can)  what impact  current PUC discussions will have on the switch 
from SRAC to PX.   Specifically we would like an opinion on the following:

1.) What is the projected timing for switching from SRAC to PX.  This can be 
in the form of a timing probability.  (ie. 50:50 in the next year, etc)

2.) Discussions are ongoing concerning what if any capacity payments are 
imbedded in the PX payments.  Based on what you know on how these discussions 
are moving forward, can you lay out a best case, worst case and most likely 
scenario.   A summary of the possible equation for calculating the new PX 
pricing would be helpful.

3.) You mentioned the possible transition from a transmission losses discount 
to a GMM adjustment.  Any comments you have on these discussions would be 
useful.

Any other comments you may have in regards to the above or the due diligence 
efforts in general would be appreciated.

and fairly relevant topic could be a current evaluation of Amazon.com and how
the projected revenues & profits relate to the current stock price.  We could
also provide some historical perspective on all realistic Amazon's stock price
was a year or two ago relative to a discounted cash flow.  I can fairly easily
get my hands on some Wall Street analyst research reports that could provide 
us
with some insights and hints as to what Wall Street is expecting.  Most of our
time can be spent creating a discounted cash flow model similar to what we 
have
been doing in class.  Since the jury is still out on Amazon's business model, 
I
think it would make for some interesting debate in class when we present our
model.

Energy Boss Says State Summer Blackouts 'Appear Inevitable' 
Carolyn Lochhead, Chronicle Washington Bureau
Friday, March 16, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/16/MN20
0965.DTL 
Washington -- The Bush administration warned yesterday that blackouts ""appear 
inevitable"" in California this summer, but it firmly rebuffed a deal from 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein that would force the state to lift its rate freeze on 
consumers in exchange for federal controls on wholesale prices. 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham insisted that price controls would make 
shortages worse by reducing power sales into the state. The administration's 
top priority is to prevent blackouts, he said. 
""Let me make one point clear,"" Abraham told the Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee. ""Any action we take must either help increase supply or 
reduce demand. . . . Price caps will not increase supply or reduce demand. In 
fact, in our view, they will seriously aggravate the supply crisis."" 
Abraham said electricity shortages in California ""will get worse, and 
blackouts this summer appear inevitable."" He cited projections of anywhere 
from 20 to 200 hours of rolling outages this summer. 
""I'm not saying that people in California don't want lower energy costs,"" he 
said. ""But I know for sure they don't want to be sitting this summer without 
electricity at all. And our goal is to try to avoid that as the primary 
public interest responsibility of this administration."" 
Feinstein became the first leading state Democrat to break with Gov. Gray 
Davis in calling for an end to the rate freeze that has kept electricity 
prices low for California consumers, even as soaring wholesale costs have 
driven the state's investor-owned utilities to bankruptcy and now are 
draining the state's budget surplus. 
But Feinstein insisted that the federal government must simultaneously force 
down wholesale prices until ample new power plants come online. 
Feinstein said higher consumer rates would encourage conservation, saying 
that if people just turned off their computers at night, they would save 7 
percent of the state's electricity supply. 
She also said the state, which now is buying electricity for the utilities, 
has already run through $2.7 billion and could spend $10 billion on 
electricity this year. 
""That is gone,"" Feinstein said. ""It doesn't buy a school. It doesn't repair a 
road. It doesn't build the water system many of us believe the state needs."" 
The offer came as a compromise with Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith, who 
warned that an ""economic and environmental catastrophe"" awaits the Western 
states this summer when electricity demand is expected to soar while a 
drought in the Northwest constricts the supply of hydroelectric power. 
Smith's move to embrace price controls, which he had earlier rejected, 
reflected sharply intensifying political pressure on the Bush administration 
to intervene in the electricity market, as Western officials complained 
bitterly yesterday that rising energy prices are forcing layoffs and now 
threaten the region's economy. 
LESSONS OF SUPPLY, DEMAND
""I'm afraid this summer we're going to be in the middle of a dry lakebed 
explaining to very angry farmers and homeowners and former factory workers 
the lessons of supply and demand,"" said Smith, whose family owns a frozen 
vegetables business. ""I don't want to send the wrong signals to the 
marketplace . . . but I'll tell you, the wrong signal is a recession."" 
Abraham repeatedly sought to counter criticism that the Bush administration 
is not doing enough to aid the West, citing a letter he sent to Davis 
yesterday that said the White House will not oppose the state's plan to take 
over the investor-owned utilities' transmission lines, despite disagreeing 
with the approach. 
""Regrettably, I think our opposition to price caps has been claimed by some 
to suggest that the administration either does not care about California and 
the West or is doing nothing to help,"" Abraham said. ""That is simply untrue."" 
Abraham said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's recent order to 13 
power suppliers to refund $69 million in January overcharges to the utilities 
would send ""a signal that companies that exploit a serious situation aren't 
going to get away with it."" 
He also cited expedited federal approvals and waivers for power plants and 
discussions with Mexico to try to increase electricity exports from Baja to 
California. 
But Abraham firmly rejected price caps, saying they ""have already been tried 
and already failed"" in California when a price ceiling for electricity sales 
into the state was reduced over the past year from $750 a megawatt hour to 
$150. 
RESULTS OF PRICE CAPS
""The lower the price cap was set, the higher average electricity prices 
rose,"" Abraham said, in part because municipal utilities were exempt. New 
federal price caps would affect just half of the Western electricity market, 
he said, and so would shift supplies from regulated to unregulated markets 
rather than control prices. 
He also said price caps would ""almost certainly"" reduce sales from Mexico and 
Canada and induce ""cheating and circumvention."" 
Armed with charts showing huge wholesale price increases over the past year, 
Feinstein expressed her strong disappointment. 
""Oh, Mr. Secretary,"" Feinstein said, ""I was really surprised by the ideologic 
hardness of your statement. I must tell you that."" 
She said California will be 5,000 megawatts short of electricity this summer, 
enough power for 5 million homes. ""It's a lot of shortness,"" she said, 
predicting that prices will reach $5,000 a megawatt hour. ""What does 
California do about that if it isn't going to get any help to provide that 
stability and reliability over that period of time? . . . All we're asking 
for is help to prevent price-gouging."" 
Abraham countered that the administration's position is ""common sense."" 
""I'm telling you, I think this summer, if California has worse blackouts than 
currently projected, that (price caps) would have been a disservice to the 
people of your state,"" Abraham said. ""If the rest of the West finds the 
Canadian energy providers refusing to sell at the same levels because of 
price caps . . . that's in my judgment an irresponsible carrying out of our 
public responsibilities here."" 
In Sacramento, Davis said he was ""particularly grateful"" for the 
administration's promise not to oppose the state transmission takeover. He 
also said the state would ""have just enough power to avoid blackouts"" but 
said ""federal officials are of a different view."" 
Still, the governor continued to urge ''some effort to temper wholesale 
prices.""

Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday:

 - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron 
and EES;
 - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 
2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001;
 - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs 
to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for 
the large industrial customer);
 - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going 
forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that 
effort;
 - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals;
 - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - 
no bullshit politics;
 - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership;
 - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success;
 - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February 
early March.

 b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission 
correlating into increased operating hours.

 a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on 
the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and
 b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions

Jonathan Johns, Ernst & Young

=> NEWS AND NOTES

THE NEW WORLD OF COMMUNICATIONS

The world really did change on September 11.  Think of 
it:  Try to remember something you did during the first 
week of September -- a party, a movie, a dinner out.  
Doesn't that seem like a lifetime ago?

At a recent seminar I gave to a group of young members of 
the International Association of Business Communicators, 
I was asked, ""How has communications changed since 
September 11?""  I think that there are two important 
shifts:  

1) All communications now must be relevant.  The era of 
cranking out meaningless press releases on top of fluffy 
brochures followed by disjointed ads is past.  I have 
been as guilty as the next person.  But here on out, 
irrelevant blather is not going to be tolerated by target 
audiences.  The example I use is the ubiquitous ""new 
senior vice president"" press release.  In the past, 
journalists (and the public) could dismiss these without 
a second thought.  Today, the recipient is just as likely 
to wonder, ""Why is this company bothering to waste 
precious resources on this?""  (If the press release 
describes a newsworthy shift in the marketplace, and 
articulates how this new senior VP address that shift in 
a way that benefits the company's customers, then that is 
a step in the right direction.) 

2) Communications that are sensitive to ""balance"" are 
more likely to resonate.  Even if a communication is 
relevant, if it has an underlying message that some 
gadget or feature is incredibly important, it will fall 
on deaf ears.  What's important today?  Balance in life.  
Family.  Friends.  Even dogs <grin>!  For example, if you 
can demonstrate that your product or service can give 
your customer more time to spend on precious moments with 
their family, you are better off than if you highlight 
the 24x7 availability that allows people to work all the 
time...

EVALUATING CONSULTANTS

Brookwoods Group is a member of the Technology 
Entrepreneurs Exchange (www.texchange.org), and I 
attended the meeting last week as a panel of experts 
discussed the critical success factors for building a 
successful business. 

Bill Nash, president of Holland & Davis management 
consultants (www.hdinc.com) was one of the panelists, and 
I scribbled some notes from his talk, including a 
paraphrase of his four tough questions that should be 
asked of any consulting firm you are considering:

1)  Have you ever been fired by a client,
    and if so, why?

2)  Have you ever turned down a client
    opportunity, and if so, why?

3)  For your client's sake, have you ever
    removed yourself from a project, and
    if so, why?

4)  For your own sake, have you ever 
    fired a client, and if so, why?

=========================================================

=> INTERESTING INTERNET

This month marks the 75th anniversary of Winnie-the-Pooh.  
I think it may have been George Carlin who asked, ""What 
is a Pooh?""  For those of us with a taste for unusual 
trivia, the name Winnie-the-Pooh was given by a real boy, 
Christopher Robin, to his stuffed teddy bear that had 
been previously called Edward Bear.  Five-year-old 
Christopher didn't really like the name, so his father, 
A.J. Milne, encouraged him to make up a new name.  The 
boy immediately came up with ""Winnie-the-Pooh,"" a 
combination of the name of a friendly bear he had met at 
the London Zoo named Winnie (after the city of Winnipeg) 
and the name of a familiar swan at Kensington Gardens.  
See the entire story at:

www.pooh-corner.com/pooh.html

The original Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Kanga and Eeyore are 
now in a glass cabinet in the Donnell Center of the New 
York Public Library.  (Roo was lost in an apple orchard 
in the 1930s.)  See: 

www.nypl.org/branch/kids/pooh/winnie.html

Speaking of children, someone sent me a little Dr-Seuss-
like tale written to help explain the September 11 
attacks to children.  It resonated in my own child-like 
mind as well and is reproduced on our website at:

www.brookwoods.com/binch.htm
 
Speaking of Dr. Seuss, many people don't realize that Dr. 
Seuss for two years (1941-1943) was the chief editorial 
cartoonist for the New York newspaper ""PM,"" and for that 
journal he drew over 400 editorial cartoons. See these 
serious political cartoons drawn in the familiar style 
during the early years of World War II at:

We are pleased to report continuous positive feedback 
from clients on all fronts. We posted some of the best 
comments on our Client page on the Brookwoods Group 
website at:

www.brookwoods.com/clients.htm

I will be a panelist for the ""Effective HighTech 
Marketing/PR Best Practices Panel"" at the November 10 
TiE-Houston Conference, ""Rediscovering & Accelerating the 
Entrepreneurial Spirit.""  See www.tie-houston.org for 
details.

Since my last Grapevine, we have brought on several great 
marketing and communications professionals, including 
consultant Nancy Burch and VP of Operations Lorry Harju.  
Lorry is working hard to refine our operations model and 
demonstrate added value to new and existing clients.

We ran a couple new print ads this summer, all of which 
use dogs to illustrate the predicaments of clients who 
could use help from Brookwoods Group.  One ad shows a dog 
balancing teacups on his nose 
(www.brookwoods.com/ad4.htm) and the other shows a dog 
trying to make-do with an ill-fitting solution 
(www.brookwoods.com/ad5.htm).  Frankly, some people think 
the latter ad is a little spooky.  Check it out and judge 
for yourself!

Comments from our readers...

Many readers noted that the HTML formatting did not 
really work on their mail readers.  Others received the 
formatting, but the graphics were not embedded where they 
belonged.  All in all, I think I'll stick with plain text 
for now!  If I want to show graphics, I'll use an html 
link!

Several people took us up on our offer to run a CarFax 
report for them.  

Gail Schutz commented on my bemoaning that my old car was 
always in the shop, noting, ""I have also heard it said 
that the two best days in a boat owner's life are the 
first day and the last day.""  She may be right.  My car 
has been in the shop since May (yes... May!).  

Kim Padgett noted that we use a woman on the phone in the 
bathtub as the icon for our Grapevine and ""Buzz"" sections 
of the website.  (www.brookwoods.com/buzz.htm).  She 
offered to ""try to find one with a man taking a bath on a 
cell phone for the next issue!!""  I never got a picture 
from her, but I did find a picture of a naked man talking 
on a headset.  Does that count?  See 
www.brookwoods.com/other/890829-001.jpg

Hank Moore thinks we do a very good job and produce ""one 
of the best e-newsletters that I've seen.""  Thanks, Hank!

to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase 
our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid 
Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 
and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to 
the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing 
system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This 
conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in 
EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then 
your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to 
reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group 
of this change.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

628,"Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

On-Line Natural Gas Reverse Auction

? ? 
The East Coast  Natural Gas Cooperative has secured over 25 Bcf of natural 
gas for  several Northeast distributors in an auction that worked in 
reverse.  For the first time, the ECNGC staged a reverse auction where it is  
the potential sellers who bid - downward - to win a sale to a buyer.  Nearly 
50 packages of natural gas demand were on the procurement  block at various 
times during the 4-day auction period, conducted  last week.

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/11/01
According to published reports, the Falcons will rest Smith in practice this week. Smith, who is dealing with an assortment of leg and ankle injuries, could see less carries in Sunday's game against Indianapolis as a result of his ailments, which makes starting him a real gamble on Week 14. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/11/01
Bettis was feeling good following treatment on his groin and hip Monday. He hasn't r! ec! eived medical clearance, but the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports that Bettis will probably play Sunday. 

Santana Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Moss could miss Sunday's game. He is suffering from a strained quadriceps and is listed as questionable. 

Mark Brunell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 12/11/01
Brunell suffered a badly cut finger in Sunday's game. He is also suffering from a sore quadriceps. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Danny Farmer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=187533&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Farmer is listed as probable for Sunday's game. He is recovering from an ankle injury. 

Jaret Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=12447&>, K - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
The Bengals released Holmes off their practice squad Monday. The Bengals signed Holmes to the practice squad on Nov. 1 after Rackers went through a stretch of missing six of nine attempts. 

Neil Rackers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=187627&>, K CIN -! F! ree Agent Updated 12/11/01
The Bengals released kicker Jaret Holmes off their practice squad Monday, an indication that Rackers' job is safe for the rest of the season. The Bengals signed Holmes to the practice squad on Nov. 1 after Rackers went through a stretch of missing six of nine attempts. 

Marco Battaglia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1324&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
The Bengals have waived Battaglia, freeing him to sign with another team. Battaglia had an appendectomy Nov. 17 and was put on the reserve-nonfootball illness list the next day, leaving him ineligible to play for the Bengals the rest of the season. Battaglia has been working out and hopes to play for another team this season. 
Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
The New York Jets might get to see Smith instead of Jon Kitna as the Cincinnati Bengals' starting quarterback next Sunday. Kitna, suffering from a finger injury, might be inactive this week. The Bengals were considering giving Smith a chance to start once they were eliminated. They want to find out whether the first-round draft pick from 1999 still fits in their long-term plans. Kitna's injury opens the way for Smith to get that audition. 

Jon Kitna <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1847&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Kitna hurt the ! mi! ddle finger on his passing hand during Sunday's game. He didn't miss a play, but the finger swelled overnight and was so painful on Monday that he couldn't grip a ball. ""I either sprained or tore ligaments on the inside of it,"" Kitna said. Kitna has started each of the Bengals' 12 games. Akili Smith could possibly start in his absence. 

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/11/01
Griese remained woozy on Monday after suffering a concussion against Seattle, and his availability for next Sunday's game at Kansas City is uncertain. Griese was hit by Seattle linebacker Levon Kirkland at the end of a 9-yard scramble early in the third quarter. He had to be helped to the sideline and didn't return. Griese will be evalauted on a daily basis. 
Chad Lewis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's win over San Diego. He might miss practice on Wednesday, but he's expected to play in this weekend's game at Washington. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Wayne played Monday and had one catch for 11 yards. He shook off an injury but is still a risky start because of his inexperience. 

Mik! e ! Vanderjagt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=12783&>, K IND - Hunter Updated 12/11/01
Vanderjagt shook off a back injury and played in Monday's game. He connected on both of his field goal attempts.

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Chambers played Monday despite suffering from a rib injury. He caught three passes, two for touchdowns. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 receiver. He doesn't catch a lot of passes but has a knack for scoring toudchdowns and making big plays. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01 Wilkins strained his right hamstring in the first half of Monday's game and did not return. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/11/01
Owens, who is already dealing with both foot and ankle injuries, suffered a slight hip pointer on Sunday vs. St. Louis. However, the star wideout is expected to start in Week 14 vs, Miami, so be sure to include him in your lineup. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Giggles Updated 12/11/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) was declared! i! nactive for Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll likely be listed as questionable for Saturday's game vs. Arizona, so use caution before starting him in Week 14. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/11/01
According to published reports, Culpepper (knee) will be listed as probable for Sunday's game against Detroit. ""We anticipate him making a lot of progress this week,"" coach Dennis Green told the Detroit News. If you have Culpepper on your roster, he'd be a good start against a porous Lions defense in Week 14, barring any setbacks. 

Panthers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=5&>, DT CAR - Free Agent Updat! ed! 12/11/01 
Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert will miss the remainder of the year due to an elbow injury that will require surgery. Gilbert is just one of a number of injured Carolina players that has made the Panthers' defense virtually worthless to Fantasy owners. 

Shawn Jefferson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Jefferson is dealing with a back injury that could keep him out of this weekend's game against Indianapolis. Jefferson is questionable at this point, according to Head Coach Dan Reeves. 

Quincy Morgan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=235232&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Morgan suffered a shoulder injury on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Mason suffered a hip injury in Sunday's loss at Minnesota. His current status is day to day.

Terry Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/10/01
Allen (hand) was able to practice on Sunday. Still, the Ravens are expected to start Moe Williams against the Steelers next Sunday while easing Allen back into action slowly.

Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/10/01
Culpepper (knee) says he should be ready for next week's game against the Lions. The Vikings, however, may be prompted to sit him again because the game is on turf. Once again, Culpepper may be a gameday decision.

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 12/10/01
Smith (ankles) was able to play on Sunday, but he was far from 100 percent. He finished with eight receptions for 66 yards. He should continue to be a reliable player during the Fantasy postseason.

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fant! as! y.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/10/01
Bettis' status for Sunday night's game at Baltimore is unclear as of now. Bill Cowher told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he would monitor the RB throughout the week. ""He won't need to lobby me,"" Cowher said. ""If he's ready to play, he'll be playing.""

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/10/01
Owens suffered a hip pointer during Sunday's loss at St. Louis, but he was able to finish the game. 

Albert Connell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&ke! y=! 1851&>, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Connell has been demoted behind Robert Wilson and Wane McGarity on the Saints' depth chart. Connell, who was inactive Sunday, is now New Orleans' No. 5 receiver.

Larry Parker <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Parker suffered a bruised right shoulder in Sunday's game against Oakland. His current status is day to day.

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

usage to avoid OFO noncompliance charges.  Supply lower than usage is not subject to OFO
 noncompliance charge.

Charges for Noncompliance:

-   Noncore customers with AMR and PG&E's Electric Generation charges are based on actual
    daily metered usage.
-   Noncore customers without AMR charges are based on ADQ
    or actual daily metered usage, whichever results in a lesser charge.
-  Core Procurement Group charges are based on the latest core load forecast.

Latest NFL Player News

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Brunell is questionable for Monday's game against Green Bay, the third straight week his status has been in question due to continued pain in his quadriceps muscle. He will be limited again in practice, and it's probably a good idea to keep him on reserve for Week 12 in your league.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Davis should be able to return from arthroscopic knee surgery in time for Sunday's game agains! t ! Miami. He will practice this week before a final decision is made, but we're skeptical the Broncos won't have him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' Fantasy values.

Keith Poole <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1779&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Poole has bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in his place, and the Denver passing game would further suffer.

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/27/01
Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might have to start Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole's recovery from a rib injury.

James Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/27/01
Jackson's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday to determine his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson can't go.

Neil Rackers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who missed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this season, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers will likely retain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.

Akili Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer . ""If that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to get rid of me,"" Smith said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mop-up role. He's not a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important to note that he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Allen, who remains out with a broken hand, could return to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job once healthy. Hold onto him if you have the room on your reserve list or play in a deeper league.

M! o! e Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1481&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running back, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.

Jason Brookins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone in his small toe, which will sideline him for at least four weeks and possibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting running back, and might be worth adding to your roster in a deeper league.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Chrebret did not practice Monday because of a shoulder injury. However, The New York Newsday reports that he is expected to play in Sunday's game. 

Jake Arians <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=192220&>, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Arians has been released by the Bills. Buffalo has signed Shayne Graham to replace him. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/2! 7/! 01
Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left knee was successful Saturday in Miami. Mora said he received the news from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician. ""I spoke with him Saturday and he told me it went very well,"" Mora said. James, the two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee when he was tackled awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on injured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to take seven months. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts offseason minicamps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James will be ready for the start of training camp. 

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/27/01
Glenn could be put on injured reserve if he doesn't recover from a hamstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps the end of his Patriots career. ""I haven't reached it yet,"" coach Bill Belichick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster spot would be better spent on someone other than Glenn. ""But as each day goes by, it gets a little bit closer."" 

Shayne Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=196720&>, K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after Jake Arians was released following a missed point-after against the Miami Dolphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start of the season. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.! co! m/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Alexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Sunday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a deeper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=12411&>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/27/01
Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday night's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the game. 

Kevan Barlow <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Barlow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. ""It's throbbing,"" Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. ""I couldn't really sleep last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting."" Barlow is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on reserve. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01
Owens suffered a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protec! ti! ve boot as a precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he will be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo. 

Jeff Thomason <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1333&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Thomason suffered a hyperextended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Monday, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight end has very little value as a Fantasy player. 

Donald Driver <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=133276&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Davis, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his health, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut him altogehter. 

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/27/01
Stewart, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, is expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting good Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of depth at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him. 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
According to the Detroit Free Press , Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. ""This is Charlie's offense,"" coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""He practiced a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would expect him close to full speed Wednesday."" He'll likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran tight end is listed as day to day. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Upda! te! d 11/27/01
According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the week. 

Brad Hoover <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=192294&>, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Hoover (neck) will likely be held out of practice this week. However, the Panthers are hopeful that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New Orleans. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Despite his inconsistent play and 14 interceptions, Weinke's job as Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is secure. ""There've been quarterbacks who have gone on to be very successful that have gone through times like this,"" coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer. ""Even though there are a number of these plays that haven't turned out and there have been disruptions in his play, I think, ultimately, it will be more beneficial than not."" While he may be the starting quarterback in Carolina, Weinke isn't worth a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues. 

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Sanders, who left Sunday's game against San Diego due to nagging hamstring injuries, is questionable for the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland. However,! h! e is optimistic that he'll be available for the game. ""I'll be there,"" Sanders told the Arizona Republic. ""They're just real sore from doing a lot of running and jumping - normal wear and tear."" In any event, keeping Sanders on your bench may be a good idea against the tough Oakland secondary. 

Rob Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 11/27/01
Moore (hamstring) was supposed to begin some light running last week, but he ended up doing nothing of the sort. ""He hasn't made a lot of progress,"" coach Dave McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""We're going to come to a point where we're going to have to make a decision."" Moore, who has missed the entire season due to injury, could be placed on the injured reserve list this week.

Latest NFL Player News

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."" 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1094&>, RB D! AL! - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."" But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.

Eddie Kennison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to statistical silence after a brief period of productivity. 

Mike Anderson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01
Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run! , ! but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.

David Patten <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1790&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.

Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.

Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.

Freddie Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01
Jo! ne! s overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.

Larry Centers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1072&>, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.

Peerless Price <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free A! ge! nt Updated 10/28/01
Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.

Shaun Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 10/28/01
! The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 10/28/01
Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.

James McKnight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.

Ron Dayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01
Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.

Amani Toomer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/28/01
Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter w! ha! t the opposition is.

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/28/01
Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sund! ay! at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.

Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 10/28/01
Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/28/01
McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.

Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/28/01
Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&rand! om! =3664&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 10/28/01
Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.

Cowboys <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.

Clint Stoerner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score ! in! Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.

Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

Message Date:  11/02/2001

Message Text:  High Inventory System Wide Operational Flow Order (SWOFO)


      OFO Stage :                        2
      Inventory Level :                 High
      Noncompliance Charge :    $1.00 /Dth
      Tolerance Band :                 11%
     

PG&E's CGT has called a High Inventory System Wide OFO for flow day 11/03/2001.

High Inventory:  Customer supply is required to be within the tolerance band percentage of daily
usage to avoid OFO noncompliance charges.  Supply lower than usage is not subject to OFO
 noncompliance charge.

Charges for Noncompliance:

-   Noncore customers with AMR and PG&E's Electric Generation charges are based on actual
    daily metered usage.
-   Noncore customers without AMR charges are based on ADQ
    or actual daily metered usage, whichever results in a lesser charge.
-  Core Procurement Group charges are based on the latest core load forecast.


Please call the CGT Helpline 1-800-343-4743 if you have any questions.

Latest NFL Player News

Mike Anderson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 11/11/01
Anderson carried four times for 23 yards against San Diego. He won't play much now that Terrell Davis is healthy. Anderson was a disappointment when Davis was out as well, as he failed to match his 2000 form.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/11/01
Davis rushed for 83 yards on 33 carries and caught five passes for 36 yards against the Chargers. He is definitely healthy enough to start for most Fantasy teams, but ! Da! vis doesn't run with the same burst that once made him an elite back.

Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/11/01
Flutie threw for 165 yards, one TD and was intercepted four times by Denver. Right now, Flutie is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.

Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/11/01
Conway caught three passes for 111 yards and a TD at Denver. He continues to be a reliable,a nd sometimes explosive Fantasy player.

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 11/11/01
Hearst had solid game against New Orleans, compiling 160 scrimmage yards on Sunday. He seems to have established himself as San Francisco's featured back in recent weeks, which is keeping Kevan Barlow's Fantasy value at a minimum. 

Jeff Garcia <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 11/11/01
Garcia, who is dealing with a sprained knee, had another big game against New Orleans. The Niners quarterback threw for 252 yards and four touchdowns, further establishing himself as a top-notch Fantasy quarterback. 

! Joe Horn, WR NO - Matty Updated 11/11/01
Horn had a big game against San Francisco, catching six passes for 99 yards and two scores. Horn now has six touchdowns in his last three games against the Niners, and is putting up some big numbers after a slow start to the season. 

Aaron Brooks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133233&>, QB NO - Matty Updated 11/11/01
Brooks had a huge game on Sunday, throwing for 347 yards and two scores against San Francisco. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him.

Correll Buckhalter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Buckhalter rushed for 66 yards and a TD against the Vikings. But he will see his numbers and playing time dwindle now that Duce Staley is healthy and capable of being a dependable RB again.

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 11/11/01
Staley rushed for 146 yards and a TD, and caught six passes for 85 yards against the Vikings. There should be little doubt about his health or current value after his stellar outing.

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script! =p! layers&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/11/01
Moss caught seven passes for 95 yards and a TD at Philadelphia. He padded his numbers well after the outcome of the game was decided, and he still does not have a 100-yard receiving game this year.

Michael Bennett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Bennett did not play at Philadelphia. Doug Chapman started in his place and finished with 19 rushing yards and 45 receiving yards.

Byron Chamberlain <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Chamberlain left Sunday's game after injuring his leg. He finished with two catches for 23 yards.

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/11/01
Boston had another huge game on Sunday, catching nine passes for 137 yards and a touchdown against the N.Y. Giants. He's become one of the best Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/11/01
Pittman was unimpressive on Sunday, rushing for only 54 ! ya! rds in Arizona's 17-10 loss to the N.Y. Giants. Pittman is best used when the matchup is to his advantage, and not as a weekly Fantasy starter. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 11/11/01
Hilliard had only 43 yards receiving against Arizona, but he did score a touchdown in New York's 17-10 win. The score was Hilliard's third in his last three games. 

Tiki Barber <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/11/01
Barber had a solid game against Arizona, compiling 118 yards rushing in the Giants' 17-10 win. Barber hasn't been very reliable as a Fantasy player this season, but he is useful when the matchup is right. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Wayne caught only two passes for 18 yards against the Dolphins. The rookie receiver is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams right now.

Marvin Harrison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 11/11/01
Harrison scorched the Dolphins for nine receptions, 174 yards and three TDs. N! o ! defense is the league can contain Harrison when he plays in front of the home crowd.

Chris Chambers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Chambers had the best game of his rookie year, catching three passes for 113 yards and two TDs. He has certainly become a great asset to Fantasy teams that are thin at WR or need help because of injuries or bye weeks. 

Lamar Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 11/11/01
The Colts' defense held Smith to 53 yards on 18 carries. Rookie Travis Minor rushed for 71 yards and a TD (56 yards), and now there will be rampant speculation that Smith might be fading as a Fantasy player.

Keenan McCardell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/11/01
McCardell caught five passes for 61 yards and a TD against he Bengals. The veteran wideout has been unreliable for much of the year, and he may follow his good performance with a quiet week.

Stacey Mack <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/11/01
Mack rushed for 71 yards and two TDs agains! t ! the Bengals. He may have restored Jacksonville's faith in him after some questionable outings, but Mack is anything but reliable.

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 11/11/01
The Jaguars held Dillon to 58 rushing yards, but he did score on a seven-yard TD run. Even if opponents limit Dillon's yardage numbers at times, it is difficult to stifle him completely. He remains worthy of No. 1 RB status on many Fantasy teams.

T.J. Houshmandzadeh <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235086&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Houshmandzadeh was Cincinnati's leading receiver at Jacksonville, catching six passes for 62 yards. Don't add him to your roster until he proves he can be a consistent contributor to the Bengals' passing game. Houshmandzadeh is a rookie, and he may fade away very quickly.

O.J. Santiago <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1633&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Santiago caught a 12-yard TD pass against the Steelers, and finished with two catches for 14 yards. Don't pick him up unless you are desperate for TE help, because Santiago has always been a Fantasy disappointment.

Kevin Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133324&>, WR CLE - Hunter Updated 11/11/01! Johnson caught a respectable eight passes for 62 yards against Pittsburgh's tough defense. Opposing secondaries are having trouble containing the third-year wideout, and he remains a must-start player every week.

Kris Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133236&>, K PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Brown made five of six field goal attempts at Cleveland, including the game-winner from 32 yards. Despite his troubles in Week Eight, Brown has been a reliable kicker for most of his three-year career in Pittsburgh.

Plaxico Burress <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Burress caught four passes for 44 yards at Cleveland. The second-year wideout has yet to produce respectable Fantasy numbers on a consistent basis,

Peerless Price <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Price caught three passes for 59 yards and a TD at New England. He continues to play well as defenses pay extra attention to Eric Moulds.

684,"MidAm advised us they intend to call the enforcement hotline, probably today, 
to get enforcement staff involved in resolving the Carlton timing problem 
(i.e., the absence of an order approving or not approving the settlement).  
If Midam does so, Enforcement will then contact Northern for a 
response--probably Dari or MKM or I, but who knows who they'll call.
If they do, the following bullets are important to convey as our preliminary 
response to MidAm:

1.  Midam, and all of our customers, are aware that a Commission order on the 
June 2, 2000 Settlement is necessary before the precise flow obligation for 
this Nov-March period can be determined.  The flow obligation for sourcers 
like MidAm will be slightly higher--by about 3%--if the settlement is 
approved.  For all customers that have asked what the precise flow obligation 
numbers would be under the two scenarios, settlement approval or settlement 
non-approval, we have given that information.  We gave that information to 
MidAm also.  We can't file the tariff sheets setting out the specific number 
for this heating season until the Commission addresses the settlement.

2.  The true financial impact of the current uncertainty on MidAm is 
minimal.  We believe many of the sourcers have locked in their supply based 
on the lower flow obligation number, but with an option to increase their 
purchase quantity if the Commission approves the settlement.  MidAm may have 
done that, but we don't know.  If not, and if the Commission approves the 
Settlement, their only real ""cost"" would arise if they have to buy the 
additional flow obligation volume--about 1100 MMBtu/d for MidAm--now at a 
higher price than they would have paid if they bought it earlier when they 
locked up the bulk of their flow obligation supply.    Given the large drop 
in gas prices the last several days, there may not be any increased cost.   

3.  The bottom line is that we really need an order on the Settlement.  The 
majority of Northern's customers support it as a fair solution to the Carlton 
problem.  MidAm is the only opponent that has raised substantive issues.  
MidAm is clinging to a financial windfall it gets under the old Carlton 
mechanism and has no reason to oppose the settlement other than preserving 
that windfall.    


That's the end of the proposed script.  The last bullet may go to far, but I 
like it.  Frank and Steve, MKM suggested that you guys get Doering and Gorak 
and others to call FERC (hotline or otherwise--I don't think it matters) and 
express their concern that the order is not on the agenda.  DF  ","Carlton Midam Dari MKM Frank Steve Doering Gorak

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.

TCO cannot attached Enron's FSS (storage) to Orwell and Lakesides GTS

afternoon and got back Friday afternoon.  One of the pipelines I deal with 
has a hunting and fishing lodge down there.  It was nice.  I caught 2 redfish

I could really get used to that sort of thing.

Joe asked me why we were doing this and I told him that ENA was probably not paying the capacity bills and Boston Gas was aware of that fact and knew Boston Gas would be liable for the demand charges anyway.

new Order 637 reporting requirements require the Index of Customers to list

quarterly.  Therefore, the indices filed under the new reporting requirements 
won't be out until early October.  I will look into this more closely when I 
get back.

735,"Chris, Faye has completed moving all of the facilities on your request, 
EXCEPT meter 006335 because a deal that is booked on that meter had volumes 
with a status other than ""expected"" which means we have to work on that 
behind the scenes.  Below is a list of deals that were impacted by her moving 
all of the other meters.  I am bouncing the server and it wil take about 15 
minutes to complete.  After that, you will have to get completely out of all 
open Sitara applications (including the Launch Pad) and get back in.  Open 
the deals listed below and make sure the location field on the deal exchange 
says ""inconsistent"".  You should only be concerned with the exchanges for 
6/1/00 and forward.  Click Edit and then go to the location field and click 
on the ellipsis.  Click OK when the Facility dialogue box opens and the 
correct zone should appear automatically.  Before you tab out of that field, 
make sure that the deal volume equals the expected volume.  If the volumes 
are not equal, make a note of the expected volumes and how they are broken 
out because they will default to the deal volume as soon as you tab out.  If 
the volumes are different, update them as necessary and then release the 
deal.  Repeat this for all exchanges for 6/1/00 and forward and for all 
deals.  The second thing you need to do is identify any swaps that are linked 
to the physical forwards.  If none are linked then that's great because you 
won't have to worry about that.  If some exist, you will have to update the 
swap to reflect the correct zone.  To do this, you need to edit the swap, go 
to the field location, remove the current (inconsistent) one and add the 
correct zone.  Hopefully this makes sense.  Please call me if you have any 
questions.  I will follow up with you on the meter 006335 tomorrow.

Dear Producers and Shippers,

 In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant 
would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.   We heard from many 
of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz 
area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed.  
Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen 
sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, 
CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until:

 1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or, 

 2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and
         processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system. 

 We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian 
Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you.  
If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson 
at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705.


        Sincerely,

Kim, could you find out from payables if we are making payments to a company 
called ""Capacity Center""?  If we are, I would like to know who with Enron is 
authorizing these payments.

Thanks.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee.

773,"Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Monday morning, (2/4/02), you will logon with your Enron NT Account and Password.  You will immediately be forced to change your password (following Enron rules) and your NT ID will stay the same.  Once you've changed your password, and logged off AGAIN, you will see the UBS Warburg Energy Screen....email will not be affected until day one.

Starting Monday, you will receive emails from IT support to explain the HOW TO's for your data that YOU  will need to begin transferring over to UBS.  All material will need to be in compliance with UBS standards and NO documents or emails are to be deleted.  In Outlook the following information will be transferred over by IT: Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, and Notes.  Emails (Inbox, Sent Items and Deleted Items) and folder structure will NOT be migrated.

ALL data MUST be migrated PRIOR to day one (estimated to be 02/08/02 ), as access to Enron data will be disabled Day 1.

Thane indicated that we could possibly do a 1 or 2 month contract, thus avoiding ""LD's"" for a NO TERM contract..  He also indicated that the Minimum Annual Fee is really monthly--thus under the No Term scenario, with a 60-day cancellation:  if we were to terminate & begin using our own QSE prior to the 60 day cancellation we'd only be liable for the $20K in ""Liquidated Damages""...$10K monthly minimum * 2 months.  The point is, if we only use 2 months we're not liable for $100K for unused months because of the ""MINIMUM ANNUAL FEE OF $120K.""

We would download APX software to upload/download our daily schedules using APX as our QSE. (no email)

There is also another option where we could be our own QSE but use the APX software to schedule for a lesser fee (which Thane is checking into).  There is a fee for the software per workstation.

Winning feels good, doesn't it? The road trip to Stillwater was fun.
We had several hundred people at the tailgate, and by the middle of
the 3rd quarter, I think the Texas fans outnumbered the Oklahoma
Aggies. All I will say about the booming Metropolis of Stillwater is
I'm glad we do not return for 2 years. Brutal. Absolutely brutal.

45-17

Texas looked a little sloppy early, but righted the ship to cruise
on course. Oklahoma State had a solid game plan, but the Texas
adjustments and superior talent overwhelmed the Cowboys. The running
game re-appeared this week, and freshman stud-to-be Cedric Benson got
his 1st career start. He did not disappoint. El Ced finished the day
with 131 yards on 31 carries. His solid running opened up the passing
lanes for Simms and Co., who picked apart the overmatched OSU secondary
to the tune of 5 touchdown passes. All in all, the much-anticipated OU
hangover did not come to pass. Texas took care of the weaker opponent,
as they should have.
___________________________________________________________
Colorado
2:30 pm
ABC telecast

ESPN Gameday (the radio edition, not the t.v. show) will be here for
the game. Texas comes in ranked #8, and CU comes in ranked #14. This
is a game both teams need to validate their seasons. Texas needs to
show the world, and themselves, that they can indeed win a big game.
A win over the Buffaloes would catapult the Longhorns forward to a
probable 10-win season (no offense, Aggies), while a loss could send
this team into a tailspin. Colorado, much like Texas, is a different
team at home. They have beaten some quality teams in Boulder, but now
must show they have grown up and can win on the road. This is a HUGE
game. If the 'horns hold serve, they should sail into College Station
9-1, with a BCS birth on the line. This will not be easy. Texas has
not seen a team that pounds the ball like CU does. The Buffs are #2
in the Big XII/#13 in the nation in rushing offense (224.7 ypg).
National t.v. coverage, temperature in the high 70's, 2 top 15 teams
getting after it? I wouldn't want it any other way.


___________________________________________________________

There will be no television for the Missouri game. The Texas Athletic
Department has asked the Missouri A.D. to allow a pay-per-view
broadcast for next week. The final decision has not been made
(as of Wednesday morning). If the game is on pay-per-view, it will be
at 2:30, if it is not, it will be at 1:00. For those of you going to
Columbia, the tailgate party will be at the Holiday Inn in Spanky's
Sports Bar. I will have a start time as soon as I know a game time.
It will be posted on the link below:

http://www.texasexes.org/chapters/TexasTailgates.html

The Baylor tailgate will be at George's Party Zone on Dutton Avenue
(just east of Floyd Casey Stadium) and is hosted by the Waco Texas
Exes. Start time will be announced next week. Plans for the Texas

___________________________________________________________
News and Notes:
* Chris Simms tied a school record with 5 touchdown passes vs.
Oklahoma State (James Brown-'94- vs. Baylor). It's amazing what a
running game will do for you.
* Cedric Benson now ranks #10 on the all time single-game freshman
rushing record with his 131 yards. Charles Hunter holds the record
with 187 (Houston - '87).
* Benson was also named the starter for the CU game. His reign begins.
* Look for Texas to run the 3-4 and the 4-3 this week. The way the Buffs
run the ball, Texas will show them many different looks.
* Last week Texas A&M threw for 334 yards vs. CU. 334 yards from a
team that HATES to throw. Look for the 'horns to throw early to set
up the run.
* Injury update: Kalen Thornton (knee) is returning to practice this
week. The defensive end should be ready to this weekend. The news is
not as good for another de, O.J. McClintock (lacerated arm). Look for
him to redshirt this year, unless they absolutely must have him.
* Colorado starting cb Roderick Sneed is out for this game with a
pulled hamstring, and his backup, Phil Jackson, has a broken hand.
3rd team corner on Roy/B.J./Sloan/Tony/Kyle? Nice.
* Some Buffalo news you may not have heard: Jashon Sykes, the
All-America candidate at middle linebacker, is done for the year with
a herniated disc. His backup, Joey Johnson, was the Defensive Big XII
Player of the Week last week.

___________________________________________________________
Around the Conference:
* Nebraska beat Baylor, 48-7, but that's not the story, this is:
the Cornhuskers had 641 yards rushing in the game. They had 4 backs
go over 100 yards. 641 yards in one game. That's almost twice what
Baylor has for the season (374).
* Texas Tech whipped the Purple Wildcats from Kansas St, 38-19. Kliff
Kingsbury threw for 409 yards and 4 touchdowns for the Red Raiders,
the most passing yards ever allowed by K-State. The Wildcats are
circling the drain. They are 0-3 in conference and 2-3 overall.
They draw the Aggies this week, while Tech gets a head check at
Nebraska. Good luck, Raiders.
* Texas A&M seems to run into the same wall when they don't play well:
turnovers from sacks. Quarterback Mark Farris has fumbled 3 times
after being hit from the blindside, and all 3 have been returned for
touchdowns, the last one vs. Colorado.
* OU has named Jason White their starting quarterback, benching
ineffective Nate Hybl. A quarterback controversy, how interesting.

Houston was on the way to Georgia to play the Bulldogs
prior to the cancellations.
The Cougars lost their opener to Rice, 21-14, back on September 1, and
have been off since. They gave up 354 yards rushing to the Owls, and
gained only 7 of their own. You might wonder, is Rice good? Well, they
had to stop a two point conversion and a pick off a pass in the last
minute to hold off Duke, 15-13, last week. Duke. At home.

?Last week I said look for Ivan Williams to become the starter at
tailback, and so it is true. The I-Train is averaging 5.7
per carry, so he's easily the best back out there right now.
?The Texas vs. Texas Tech game time has been set for 6:00 p.m. on 9/29,
and Fox Sports Network will carry it. It is as I thought it would be,
since every Texas/Tech game has been at night since 1995.
?Texas picked up it's 13th commitment of the season when Chase Pittman
pledged to Texas. The brother of Cole said, ""My brother and I didn't
agree on everything, although we were best friends? We both wanted to
play for the best coach in the country."" Chase said he knew at his
brother's dedication ceremony in Austin vs. UNC he was coming to Texas,
""Texas is home to me,"" he stated. Welcome home.

Around the Conference:
?Oklahoma starting defensive end Dan Cody has quit the team. Cody
suffers from a severe case of clinical depression, and has left to
take care of himself. Good luck, Dan.
?Former Longhorn recruit and Tennessee Volunteer Lynn McGruder has
found a new home. The Sophomore from Las Vegas was kicked off of the
ther UT football team for a felony charge of possession and intent to
deliver and sell marijuana. Kicked off of the team and facing jail
time, what new school did McGruder find to welcome him in?. That's
right, Oklahoma. Coach Stoops says he hasn't announced whether or not
McGruder will participate in football, but it seems inevitable. I smell
gunfire over c.d.'s and snowball fights that end in teargas and riot
police. Just like the 80's all over again. Welcome back, Sooner.

Ladies and Gentlemen ... wear Leather.
If I could offer you only one tip for improving your life, wearing leather
would be it.

The long term benefits of leather have been proved by serious bikers over
many highways and many years, whereas wearing something unreliable like
shorts and flipflops means you will experience a trip to the emergency room.
There, uncaring nurses will scrub gravel out of your wounds, and doctors
will dispense ineffective painkillers and meaningless advice ... like
telling you to trade that ""murdercycle"" in for a Camry.

Bullshit. I will dispense some real advice right now:

Enjoy the power and beauty of your ride; If you don't already; you can fully
enjoy it by doing block-long smokey burnouts in the parking lot at the local
drive-in. Pass slower bikers on the right inside of the uphill curve when
they will not let you pass to the left.

Trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at the photos of you and your pals on
your bikes and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much fun you had and
how fabulous you really looked hauling ass down the highway dressed in
leather.

Leather is as sexy as you imagine.

Don't worry about what your Mom thinks; or worry about what others think.
Know that worrying about what other people think is as effective as trying
to scratch your nose in a blinding hailstorm at 80 m.p.h. with a full- face
helmet and winter gloves on. The real troubles in your life are apt to be
Volvo stationwagons, driven by some dipstick talking into his cell phone or
doing her makeup; the kind that blindside you at 4 PM on some urban roadway
and then claim you crashed into THEM.

Do one thing everyday that scares other drivers... Lanesplit.

Ladies, learn to ride and then ride often. Nothing is more of an equalizer
than a woman, dressed in leather, astride her own machine. Gentlemen,
respect the ladies who ride, for they could very well have been the rider
that waxed your fanny in the mountian curves you just came through.

Sing into your helmet. Use mouthwash first. Keep mints handy.

Don't be reckless with other people's bikes, especially if you don't have
insurance. Don't put up with people who mess with yours.... in fact, beat
them with a chain.

Ride Fast.

Don't waste your money on chrome, or fancy paintjobs; spend it on racing or
partying. Sometimes you're fast, sometimes you're slow. Sometimes you're
hungover. The ride is long, and in the end, a cold beer tastes pretty damn
good.

Remember the good rides you've had, forget the cuts and bruises.

Watch cage drivers to not signal before pulling into your lane. Be alert for
brainless cage drivers to pull an opposing left turn in front of you. May
the fool on four wheels in front of you have working brake lights.

Try to wear out the sides of your tires before the middle.... if you succeed
in doing this, tell me how.

Keep your oil changed, throw away old traffic citations.

Enjoy your bike, use it every way you can...don't be afraid of it, or what
other people think of it, it's the greatest instrument of pleasure you'll
ever own, not counting porn sites and a fast modem.

Take chances.

Don't feel guilty if you ride faster than the posted limit ...the most
interesting people I know didn't know at 22 how to ride conservatively, all
the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't.

Get plenty of saddle time.

Be kind to your passengers, you'll miss them if they fall off.

Maybe you'll crash, maybe you won't, maybe you'll have surgery, maybe you
won't, maybe you'll ride a cruiser off a cliff doing 40, maybe you'll get a
new motocrosser for your 75th birthday ...whatever you ride, don't
congratulate yourself too much - your choices are 90% foreign, 10% domestic;
so are everyone else's.

Wrench... even if you have nowhere to do it but in your hotel room.

Do not read American motorcycle magazines, they will only make you wish
you'd bought a British one instead. Read British motorcycle magazines and
laugh at how the brits laugh at americans. Stay away from German motorcycle
magazines, they are too serious and difficult to read.

Read the owner's manual, even though you won't remember any of it.

Get to know your brake pads, you never know when they'll be gone for good.
Remember, brake pads let you stop. Be nice to your tires; they are your link
to the pavement and the things most likely to save your butt from a nasty
highside.

Understand that mechanics comes and mechanics go, but for a precious
talented few you should pay them well and buy them sixpacks. Work hard to
bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle because the older your bike gets,
the more you'll need the mechanic who worked on it when it was young and
still not paid off.

Ride in New York City once, but leave before you get killed; ride in
Northern California whenever possible, but leave a plausible excuse when
calling in sick for work. Ride in the Ozarks and learn the trick of the
curve. Ride the Blue Ridge Parkway and learn to be smooth. Ride through
Deals Gap and live to tell others about it. Stop and watch others ride
through Deals Gap and applaud when others do it well.

Do lurid wheelies.

Accept certain inalienable truths: prices will rise, traffic will get worse,
you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were
young, gasoline was cheap, the highway patrol couldn't catch you, and Harley
owners weren't all yuppies.

Respect your rev-limiter.

Don't expect anyone else to see your bike unless it has really loud pipes.

Maybe your bike has a big gas tank, maybe a smaller one; but remember,
either way you'll have to make bathroom stops.

Stop and offer help to the stranded motorcyclist along the open road, for
the next you come along could very well be yourself.

Don't mess too much with your carburetors, or by the time your done, you'll
be walking home and your pipes will be blue.

Be careful whose advice you buy, and save your receipts. Don't take advice
from those who supply it for free, especially if they own a Britbike.

Motorcycle restoration is a form of self-torture. Doing it is a way of
pulling the past from the dustbin, degreasing it, painting over the rusty
parts and dumping way more money into it than it's worth. Indian restoration
is a truely refined ailment that is only cured by death or an unlimited bank
account.

But trust me on the leather...

                          Evidence points to a small region of the brain. This
                          region is where habits and behaviors are formed at a
                          very early age.</font></p>

                          as the basal ganglia, this stubborn little area seems

                          seem to want to go into reverse easily. Some basal ganglias

                    As many of us are reminded each New Year's Day, there's nothing
                    quite so relentlessly and painfully recalcitrant as a bad
                    habit. Ann Graybiel, an MIT professor of brain and cognitive
                    sciences, wants to find out why we persist in certain behaviors.
                    She hopes her efforts will someday help yield remedies for
                    unwanted habits. <i> <a HREF=http://list.brain.com/ct.php?i=1227302&m=71&l=9>More

            Clinicians have long suspected that a relationship existed between
            individuals who expressed anger and stroke risk. Indeed, medical literature
            has long described the so-called &quot;stroke-prone personality.&quot;
            A mechanism underlying this relationship would certainly not be too
            difficult to conceive of since the statistical link between anger
            outbursts and hypertension as well as heart disease have been well
            described. <a HREF=http://list.brain.com/ct.php?i=1227302&m=71&l=29>Click

845,"As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

 ",Narsimha,500,

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

      Mind machines are tools for gently inducing a calm, centered, and euphoric
      state. They produce psychedelic mandala like patterns on the back of your
      eyelids and soothe your senses with drum like sound pulses. Although immensely
      pleasurable and entertaining, they are not toys. Many helping professionals
      in the fields of medicine and psychology currently use mind machines as
      adjunct treatments for their patients and clients. <br>

I think I need some help reconciling what Steve Richman has and we have 
booked for the HUB deals.  He sent me a spreadsheet with deals but I cannot 
even come close to tying them out to what we have booked in Tagg.  Richard 
suggested I contact you since Steve is out.  Attached is a list of deals we 
currently have booked in Tagg for the HUB deals.  They need to be verified 
before I can calc them for value and positions.  I will be out tomorrow, 
returning on Monday.  Thanks for your help.  Please call me with any 
questions.

There is still some cash in the custodial accounts.  I wanted you to buy more 
of the existing mutual funds.  Also, I am going to write a check out of my 
CMA account for more than the current cash balance.  Do I need to sell some

The reason my mistake was not caught on the benchmark signoff procedure is 
that the postid in question did not have a net position.  The procedure 
Rahmann showed you is where we check GERMS positions to the position reports 
we run using Excel queries.  If a postid has a net position and is not 
officialized, it will be caught using this procedure.  It will not, however, 
if the postid does not have a position.  I understand the importance of 
officializing postid's, as does the entire West desk.  Thanks.

I am afraid I have not made that much progress on my assignment.  I talked to 
ML Ruffer about the $1.2M basis swap.  She does not specifically know about 
the deal, but does know she gave between $1M and $2M to the West desk out of 
a reserve behind the scenes.  I don't know for sure, but this has to be how 
the $ got in the West P&L.  It is booked on 11/12/99 which is between 
EC3952.P (the annuity getting the unamortized $27M into the West desk) and 
EC3952.S (the annuity getting the $5M from Corp into the West desk).  I 
hadn't paid attention until just now, but Suzette Emmons booked the deal.  
She ran the transport book at that time.  

The physical buys from Canada (EC2208.11, EC3952.15, and EC3952.11) are 
booked correctly in Sitara.  EC3952.11 was changed by Kathy Reeves from 
ending in '08 to ending in '01 on 4/4/00.  However, the end date remains '08 
in Sitara.  I don't know why the term was changed.

I have meetings almost all day.  I will still try and investigate, but I know 
you were looking for some answers today.  You may want to try and get in 
touch with Suzette and see if she remembers the basis swaps.

Portland in general?  How are her and Jay doing?
I've been pretty good.  Keeping busy with work, babysitting, what not.  I'm
house sitting for my boss David Ho this whole week and watching his 7 year
old son Zack.  I take Zack to school in the mornings and pick him up after
work and then we just hang for the rest of the evening.  He's really a cool
kid.  Very disciplined.  But I don't think he gets much attention from his
parents and I don't think they let him be a kid very much.  So I've been
spoiling him.  We go out to dinner and I let him order whatever he wants.  I
tought him how to play poker last night and we made brownies and he acted as
if it was the coolest, most exciting thing he's ever done.  He kept saying,
""We're having fun!  This is FUN!""  As if having fun and being a kid was some
weird concept.  Tonight we're going to a baseball game and he's stoked about
that cause his parents don't let him play sports.  I took him to my
apartment yesterday and he asked my why I lived in a ""hotel"".  I should have
told him, ""Cause your Daddy doesn't pay me enough,"" but I guess that would
have been bad.
Jesse's band played this last weekend at the Old Market Pub.  Mom and Kurt
came and my Dad came too.  My Dad ran the sound board and he was so stoked!
He was so excited that Jesse wanted to involve him like that.  Mom & Kurt
just got back from visiting my sister in Amsterdam.  They took a road trip
to Paris and my Mom broke her foot while they were there so they had to see
Paris from the car. She's wearing a huge, purple cast.  But she's ok.  She's
got a little cast shoe so that she can walk on it without crutches.  We got
all fucked up when the band played and she was dancing all night on it.
I guess that's it.  Looking forward to the nice weather.  I love Portland in
the Spring and Summer, it puts me in the best mood!  Going down to LA in
July for business.  If you happen to be there by chance, we'll have to
party.  Don't worry, no Kristen!!!
Are things going well with you?  How's work?  How's life in general?

FERC Approves Contentious Order on California
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) last Friday unanimously
approved a comprehensive order on ways to fix California's troubled=20
marketplace.
Though some, including Commissioner Curt H,bert, hoped this order would
be the final word, FERC signaled that more work has to be done to reach
market consensus on several issues, including a new market structure for
the state.

ANALYSIS: Although some ongoing and larger issues remain, this order does
bring closure to FERC's proposed ruling from last month, which had outlined
several key remedies to repair what has roundly been called a flawed system
in California. FERC previously had determined that the dysfunctional market
structure in the state had caused ""unjust and unreasonable rates"" for=20
utilities
that must purchase power on the wholesale market, and end-use customers
such as those in San Diego who no longer are protected by a rate freeze.
With a couple of important exceptions, the Commission essentially gave
a rubber stamp of approval to its proposed order that was issued on Nov.
1, after receiving input from participants throughout the energy industry.

As expected, FERC adopted its ""soft"" rate cap of $150/MWh. In real terms,
this means that bids above this amount cannot set the market clearing price
that is paid to other bidders for power on the wholesale market. The rate
cap is referred to as ""soft"" because sellers may bid above this level and
receive their bid if they are dispatched, but anything higher than $150/MWh
will not set the price that all other generators will receive. Any generato=
r
setting a bid above $150/MWh must report their bid to the Commission, and
presumably fall under intense scrutiny.

FERC also officially adopted a policy that removes restrictions against
bilateral contracts in California and de-emphasizes spot-market activity.
Moving forward, buyers and sellers in the California market no longer
have to sell into and buy from the California PX. Instead, long-term contra=
cts
may be established between power distribution utilities and power sellers.
Specifically, FERC set into place a $74/MWh ""target price"" for forward
contracts. This represented a new policy on the part of the Commission
that had not previously been outlined in its proposed order, and was the
source of a great deal of contention within FERC. Commissioner Linda Breath=
itt
offered that the $74/MWh target price could possibly set the ""standard
for reasonableness."" However, unlike the $150/MWh rate cap for transactions
on the open market, prices below the target price of $74/MWh will likely
be accepted without the same level of scrutiny from FERC. Higher prices
may be subject to review.

A month ago, FERC had proposed establishing independent (non-stakeholder)
boards for the California Independent System Operator (ISO) and the PX.
This turned out to be more easily said than done, and was one of the earlie=
r
proposals from which FERC retreated in its final order. Essentially FERC
had wanted to replace existing members of the respective boards with new
members not associated with the energy industry. However, the word is out
that California Governor Gray Davis had put pressure on FERC to not adopt
this policy because the governor himself wants to be able to choose new
members for the boards that will be ""more sensitive to the needs of Califor=
nia
consumers."" In the end, FERC decided that a new governing structure for
both the ISO and PX would be put into place by April of next year, and
would be established with the cooperation of the governor and other state
officials. Until that time, the current board members will continue to
act in an advisory capacity.

Signaling that FERC's final order will by no means close the book on the
problems we are seeing in California, Southern California Edison (SCE)
immediately responded with ""deep disappointment"" to the Commission's order.
Specifically, SCE claims that the order will do nothing to protect Californ=
ia
consumers from the unjust and unreasonable wholesale electricity prices
that FERC already agreed were in existence in the state. SCE previously
had urged FERC to adopt cost-based pricing rules, meaning that each power
seller would be able to bid into the market at variable operating costs.
FERC had taken this cost-based approach with the initial operation of the
restructured PJM pool, which appears to be working rather well in that
area. However, FERC did not adopt this approach for California, and SCE
contends that since November the soft rate cap of $150/MWh has been in
place and rates have continued to skyrocket.

Reportedly, prices last week in California reached as high as $1,400/MWh,
compared to an average of $31/MWh, which SCE claims was the price that
it charged for power from its own plants during the month of December in
previous years. Thus, SCE contends that FERC has not fulfilled its regulato=
ry
obligation to repair the system in California, and as a result a severe
operational crisis in the state now appears inevitable.

Again, as we saw with the proposed order, dissension ran high within the
FERC itself. Commissioner H,bert reportedly felt that the final order was
""too timid"" and that it did not do enough to solve the problems in Californ=
ia.
FERC Chairman James Hoecker appeared to be open to region-wide rate caps,
which H,bert strongly opposed and said could never receive approval from
the Commission. H,bert's consistent position has been that FERC is=20
over-extending
its reach to mitigate prices, something he believes the Commission is=20
ill-equipped
to do. H,bert, who by the way is rumored to become the next FERC chair,
dislikes any kind of rate cap and prefers instead to let market participant=
s
manage their own exposure to price risk.

As I had discussed when I outlined the proposed order back in November
(see IssueAlert from Nov. 2 on www.consultrci.com), I questioned whether
or not FERC could reach any long-term solutions to California's problems.
The lack of consensus regarding how to fix California's dysfunctional marke=
t=01*
not
only within the Commission, but throughout the industry as a whole=01*only
seems to be growing. FERC set out with the clear goal of bringing down
energy prices for consumers, but it is still questionable if this final
order can accomplish that objective. As SCE notes, the soft price cap has
done nothing to keep prices down in the state, and concerns about power
supply in California continue to increase. In fact, nearly every day during
this month the California ISO has issued a stage one or two emergency warni=
ng,
indicating that operating reserves of power in the state are falling to
alarming lows.

Consequently, although this order attempted to reach resolution, it still
seems like there is little chance that we will see the end of the debate
over California any time soon. Perhaps the best feature of this order is
the removal of the requirement that buyers must obtain their power through
the California PX. The three California investor-owned utilities (PG&E,
SCE and SDG&E) represent 80 percent of the buying market in the state.
Through establishing bilateral contracts, they will have a new way to=20
negotiate
the prices they pay for power, which could ultimately bring some stabilizat=
ion
to the market in the state.

However, if California is indeed headed for even worse problems than it
has faced thus far, it will quickly become apparent whether or not FERC's
order does anything to abate the crisis. Quite possibly, the next course
of action could be taking the California issues to federal court for=20
resolution,
which=01*much like our recent presidential election=01*could mean months (o=
r
years) of further negotiations.

My recollection is that the NewPower Noncompete and the ServiceCo Noncompete allow defeasance of the noncompetition provisions by permitting the investors to have put rights at fair market value (in other words, the noncompete provisions will bind a successor unless the investor honors the put rights).  It has been some time since I reviewed the Solar Noncompete, but I believe it could bind a successor if a third party merged or consolidated with Enron Corp., as opposed to a stock or asset purchase.  I also need to check the expiry date of this agreement, as it may be close to expiration.

975,"As I mentioned over the phone, the general provisions of your tariff should 
be modified so that they apply to generator interconnection  (e.g., the 
dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to 
""Transmission Service"" not interconnection service)  Although I haven't done 
a detailed review of PGE's tariff I noted similar concerns about Sections 6, 
7.3, and 11.  Also ""transmission service"" should be capitalized.

Some Other suggestions:

Preamble - Sentence three - delete: ""[t]hese Interconnection Procedures do 
not provide for transmission service on the Transmission System.""  Insert:  
""These Interconnection Procedures apply only to the receipt point portion of 
Transmission Service on the Transmission System.""

Sentence four - delete ""of the Transmission System""  Parts II and III are 
defined terms.

Section 2.2 - Under this provision, if the Interconnection Customer makes 
changes to the information supporting its interconnection request that 
""materially affect its interconnection"" it can lose its place in the queue.  
Given how much discretion this gives PGE, ""materially affect"" should be a 
defined term or have a standard for its application.

Section 3.1: Revise the last sentence as follows ""The Interconnection 
Customer must execute, complete, and return  . . . ""

Further PGE should add a provision indicating that if its merchant function 
desires interconnection that it should have to follow the interconnection 
procedures. 

Section 3.4 This section should be amended to require that the short circuit 
and stability study take into consideration higher queued projects.

Section 3.4(iii): Power flow studies are only necessary for transmission 
service not just for interconnection.   Accordingly, Section (iii) should be 
changed to have the information studied for the customer's information only 
or to say that it is not related to the interconnection queue.

Section 4.1 - When does the customer's responsibility to respond to 
higher-queued projects end?  Does this extend the 60-day period every time it 
happens?

Section 4.4   

In sentence two - Delete ""Network Upgrade necessary to remove overloads and""

Work the following definitions into Section 4.4:
Interconnection Facilities means the local equipment necessary to connect the 
plant to the point of interconnection including increasing the capacity of an 
existing local transmission line(s) to loop the lines into the plant in the 
case where the capacity of the line is less than the capacity of the 
generating plant under good utility practice.
Network Upgrades mean modifications beyond Interconnection Facilities 
required for safe and reliable connection of the generating plant to the 
utility system.  They do not include transmission changes required to deliver 
power beyond the point of interconnection. 

In sentence three delete: modifications or additions to the Transmission 
Provider's transmission lines and substations and add ""Network Upgrades.""

of obtaining a ruling that the ISO, SCE and PG&E have violated the ISO's 
tariff by defaulting to market participants?  Similarly, would there be any 
utility in invoking the PX's arbitration procedures seeking a determination 
that SCE and PG&E have violated the PX's tariff in their defaults, and 
whether we are presently enjoined from pursuing this option against the PX in 
light of the automatic stay?  In addition to seeking repayment (which 
obviously is presently problematic), the purpose we would seek a full

to obtain a finding by the arbitrators that could be helpful in possible

      ? Filing Due March 22nd
      ? Conference Call on Wednesday, March 21st, 2:00 p.m.
        (EST)

Attached are draft EPSA comments in response to the Commission Staff's 
recommendations on market monitoring and mitigation in California.  As 
explained in an earlier memo, these proposals are designed to replace to $150 
price break set out in the Commission's December 15th order, which is 
scheduled to run only until April 30th.  While supporting certain aspects of 
the Staff's recommendations, including the extremely limited application and 
the use of a single price auction, EPSA's comments focus on the failure of 
the Commission's cost-based approach to capture the full costs of capacity, 
scarcity, opportunity cost, risk and operating costs and the problem of using 
a cost-based approach during periods of scarcity.

Comments for rehearing are due at FERC on Thursday, March 22nd.  We will 
discuss this draft on our regular Wednesday afternoon conference call on 
March 21st at 2:00 p.m. (EST).  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask 
for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.  If you have any questions or concerns, or any

1029," ISO Market Participants:

 As you may know, the ISO Governing Board, at their March 15, 2001
meeting, approved in concept the Market Stabilization Plan (MSP) proposed by
the ISO. Although there was no formal motion, they directed Management to
proceed with the plan and prepare a filing to be submitted to FERC this
week. The proposed MSP and Lorenzo Kristov's presentation are posted on the
ISO's web site at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/03/09/2001030913380120705.html.

 When we discussed this proposal at the conference call on March 9,
participants identified some implementation issues that would need to be
addressed in order to implement the MSP. In addition, many of you have
certainly identified other implementation issues since March 9.

 On Tuesday, March 27, the ISO will host a conference call from 11:00
a.m. to 2:00 p.m. PST to discuss MSP implementation issues. The call-in
information is as follows:

 Call In Number: (877) 381-6005

 Conference ID: 98843

 Conference Leader: Byron Woertz

 The purpose of the conference call is to provide Market Participants
with additional MSP implementation information and to answer questions that
Participants may have. In addition, the ISO will describe resource-specific
data that is needed from Participants for development of cost-based bids to
be used for resources bid into the market. Please note that we will not
discuss policy issues or whether the MSP should be implemented. We will
assume for this discussion that the ISO proceeds with implementing the plan
as presented to the Board and will address only those issues that would
affect our ability to implement the proposed MSP.

1032,"Hello, Everyone -

This Notice confirms our meeting for this coming Friday, March 23, 2001,
from 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. at the Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel.
Because there are fewer items on the agenda, this RRG meeting should be
shorter than usual, and we hope to wrap up by 11:00 a.m.

The purpose of the meeting is primarily to discuss with the RRG a phased
approach to implementing congestion management.  The filing utilities are
very aware of the concerns many parties have expressed about process
overload, and the burden this imposes on you. Consequently, the filing
utilities are considering a more focused process that will call for
prioritizing the work streams over the next few weeks.  Part of this more
focused process is a proposal for a potential phasing of congestion
management implementation. A background paper for your review before the
meeting is attached.

The working agenda is:

1. Market Monitoring:  Recommendation Regarding Stage 1 Decision

2. Clarification of RTO West Treatment of Losses

3. Clarification of Stage 1 Decision on Interconnection Standards

4.. Potential Phasing of Congestion Management Implementation

5. Report on TransConnect

6. Benefit-Cost Study

A word about the new benefit-cost study.  It is my view that before we can
profitably engage in a new study that will be useful to regional parties a
number of issues need to be resolved first.  For example, it will be
important to know and not just assume what the scope and regional
configuration of RTO West is likely to be.  We are all waiting for FERC's
response to the October 23 filing and its declaratory order regarding the
RTO West scope and regional configuration as proposed in the October 23
application.  The reason for my uncertainty and the need for clarification
on scope and regional configuration is FERC's press release of March 14 in
which it ""encouraged the formation of a regional transmission organization
(RTO) for the western markets.""  What does this mean for RTO West? In
addition to understanding the scope of RTO West, it will also be important
to know and not just assume what the congestion and pricing models will be
for RTO West.  Determining these models will probably take a few more weeks.
As we discussed in earlier RRG meetings, a benefit-cost analysis may become
important parts of filings with the various state commissions.
Understanding what the state commissions are looking for is also important.
Because of  the need for this information, and the more focused process we
are considering, I have recommended to the filing utilities that the
benefit-cost work be deferred until these issues are resolved.  I would
appreciate your views on this subject at the RRG meeting as well.

I look forward to seeing you this Friday, March 23.

Dissension at FERC:=20
Commission Divided On Price Caps, Future Leadership

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News item from Reuters, March 20] The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
(FERC) said it remained divided on whether it should impose a temporary cap=
=20
on wholesale prices in the western United States to prevent summer blackout=
s=20
and price spikes. The three FERC commissioners, who regulate interstate=20
electricity markets, testified at a House of Representatives Energy and Air=
=20
Quality subcommittee hearing as California braced for another day of=20
blackouts.=20

Analysis: Since the start of deregulation in the early 1990s, FERC's variou=
s=20
positions on how competition should unfold across the country have been=20
fairly consistent. Despite its changing members, as a whole the five-member=
=20
commission (with two positions currently open) has taken a ""hands-off""=20
approach to its regulatory role, preferring instead to allow free market=20
forces to drive competition in the energy industry. In fact, Curt H,bert,=
=20
appointed as FERC chairman in January by President Bush, told me in an=20
interview during his tenure as a commissioner that he envisioned a time whe=
n=20
FERC would step out of its regulatory role altogether. However, significant=
=20
structural and philosophical changes within the FERC have surfaced since=20
January, dovetailing with the departure of former chairman James Hoecker. A=
s=20
the federal regulatory body for the energy industry, FERC has the=20
responsibility for setting price caps in all regions across the country. Th=
e=20
debate over whether or not to take this controversial step seems to have=20
exposed some inherent dissension within FERC at the very time when the futu=
re=20
leadership of the commission has been cast in doubt. =20

At the House of Representatives meeting on March 20, H,bert, a Republican,=
=20
reiterated his objections to price caps. Chairman H,bert has maintained his=
=20
long-standing opinion that wholesale price caps have done and can do=20
""long-term damage."" In January, H,bert told me, ""I have seen no evidence th=
at=20
price caps will have any positive impact in creating a balanced market.""=20
Although still generally opposed to wholesale price caps on a federal or=20
regional level, H,bert is willing to consider them as one possibility among=
=20
other short-term resolutions to the ongoing market problems in California.=
=20
Reuters reported that H,bert said at the hearings that ""such controls are n=
ot=20
a long-term solution and would discourage the industry from building more=
=20
power plants to supply the West."" Rather, H,bert believes that power=20
generators need the financial incentive to build new power plants, both in=
=20
California and elsewhere. H,bert was quoted at the subcommittee hearings as=
=20
saying, ""Market prices will increase supply and reduce demand, thus=20
correcting the current imbalance. Capping prices through regulation or=20
legislation will have exactly the opposite effect.""=20

Despite H,bert's opposition to wholesale price caps, fellow Commissioner=20
William Massey, a Democrat, asserted that California and the western region=
=20
were in such a state of disrepair that a temporary ""time out"" or price cap=
=20
was needed to let the market stabilize. ""The commission must act forcefully=
=20
and decisively to reassure market participants, policymakers and consumers=
=20
that jurisdictional wholesale markets will produce consumer benefits and ju=
st=20
and reasonable rates,"" Massey said. In addition, Massey reportedly also sai=
d=20
that ""such a price cap could be calculated on a generator-by-generator basi=
s=20
at each generator's variable operating cost, plus a reasonable capacity=20
adder, perhaps in the range of $25 per megawatt hour."" Massey reiterated th=
e=20
severity of the crisis in California, noting that whereas wholesale power i=
n=20
the state cost $7 billion in 1999 it increased to $27 billion in 2000 and=
=20
could exceed $70 billion for 2001. =20

Rounding out the commission's divided opinion was Commissioner Linda Key=20
Breathitt, a Democrat, who said that all possible options should be analyze=
d=20
and debated. Breathitt did not specifically mention any preference for pric=
e=20
controls.=20

Chairman H,bert's stand against price caps is shared by Energy Secretary=20
Spencer Abraham and seemingly the entire Bush administration. In fact,=20
Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will ""discourage investmen=
t=20
in new generation at a time when it is most needed"" and drive power produce=
rs=20
to other regions of the country (and further away from California). The=20
Energy Secretary reportedly issued an even stronger statement against price=
=20
caps during a Senate hearing on the electricity crisis in California. ""The=
=20
only action the administration will not take is the implementation of price=
=20
caps,"" Abraham said. =20

Another House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearin=
g=20
is scheduled for later this week. Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, a Texas=
=20
Republican, noted that the subcommittee will work toward deciding whether o=
r=20
not legislation regarding wholesale price caps should be developed over the=
=20
next few weeks. =20

This is not the first time that clear schisms have become visible within FE=
RC=20
over major issues facing the energy industry. The commission also became=20
divided regarding the scope of regulation regarding regional transmission=
=20
organizations (RTOs). FERC's December 1999 vote on the Alliance RTO=20
illustrated dissension within the commission and the divergent philosophies=
=20
that the FERC commissioners hold regarding how the industry should be=20
regulated. Then-Commissioner H,bert was of the opinion that the Alliance RT=
O=20
met FERC guidelines for RTO formation, and was the sole member who=20
successfully pushed for voluntary rather than mandatory participation in an=
=20
RTO. However, H,bert stood as a minority. The other three commissioners at=
=20
FERC at the time (Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt) preferred to wield a tight=
er=20
regulatory hand and monitor how transmission owners comply with current=20
transmission policy. While H,bert supports the ownership of RTOs by utiliti=
es=20
and letting free market principles rule, the other commissioners at FERC=20
appeared to support only passive ownership of RTOs by utilities.=20

Meanwhile, speculation continues that President Bush will soon appoint Pat=
=20
Wood III, chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), to the=
=20
position of FERC chairman. H,bert was named chairman in February by Preside=
nt=20
Bush after James Hoecker resigned shortly before the new Republican=20
administration took office Jan. 20. At that time, the president did not=20
indicate that H,bert's appointment as chair was temporary. Wood was appoint=
ed=20
by then Texas Governor Bush to the PUCT in 1995 and played a primary role i=
n=20
the development of that state's restructuring plan. (Electric choice begins=
=20
in Texas on June 1, 2001, with the start of a pilot program and then the=20
market opens fully to competition on Jan. 1, 2002). =20

The possible shift in leadership at FERC appears to be politically motivate=
d.=20
There are two ""Republican"" openings to be filled at FERC by President Bush.=
=20
As noted, presently H,bert is the only Republican among the current three=
=20
members. Wood, reportedly a close ally and advisor to the former Texas=20
governor, has been repeatedly named as a strong candidate for one of the=20
Republican openings on FERC for some time. However, the Washington Post and=
=20
Reuters have reported that Wood will be appointed as FERC chairman, forcing=
=20
H,bert to step back into a role as commissioner. The report in Reuters=20
indicated that H,bert, a friend and prot,g, of Senate Majority Leader Trent=
=20
Lott (R-Miss.), is personally ""fighting the planned move."" The nomination=
=20
would require Senate confirmation.=20

Moreover, as political drivers continue to impact the structure of FERC, th=
e=20
issue of price caps remains unresolved. The debate over price caps also has=
=20
divided others involved, strictly along party lines. Generally speaking,=20
Democrats believe that the federal government should step in to prevent wha=
t=20
has been called ""price gouging"" on the part of  energy companies. Republica=
ns=20
believe that the government (including FERC and the Bush administration)=20
should maintain a ""hands-off"" approach and allow the marketplace to determi=
ne=20
prices. Speaking from a non-partisan point of view, some economists now=20
question whether=01*and not just how=01*deregulation of electricity markets=
 should=20
occur at all. For instance, Alfred E. Kahn, the Cornell University economis=
t=20

ot=20
lend themselves to full competition and that there may be a value in=20
retaining vertical integration among utilities (allowing a single regulated=
=20
power company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity). The movemen=

dated 3/6/01.  When the draft is ready for distribution to Nevada Power, a 
new blackline will need to be generated showing all changes from their draft 
as this one only shows the changes from our recent call.  Andrea is still 
working on a short memo on how the transmission credits are calculated and 
may have a few more changes to one or two sections, but I thought I would get 
this draft out so you can be looking at it.  As I recall, Dale was also going 
to see if he could find some additional definitional or other language here 
and there so please send that if it could be located.  We did make revisions 
to at least two of those items, Emergency and Abnormal Condition so you might 
look those over.  We also still need to hear from David Marshall on the 
insurance provisions.  The name of the entity is probably not correct (as it 
is not a Cogen and may not exist yet?) so I put it in brackets (it is 
definitely not correct if it is ultimately to be the same entity as owns the 
existing facility).  If you want to provide the notice parties/addresses we 
can fill that in now as well.  We still have to work through the exhibits but 
that is probably best put off until Nevada Power has provided most of the 
information from their side.  Let me know when you'd like to discuss.

1046,"In discussions with Ruth Bennett at BPA's Transmission Business Line this 
morning I learned that BPA is entertaining imposing a moratorium on ALL new 
requests for System Impact Studies and Requests to Reserve Transmission. BPA 
indicated they have over 33,000 MW's of such studies and requests in the 
queue and are overwhelmed at this point. They have got to put the skids on 
this quickly. 

On a related matter, BPA does not presently draw a distinction between 
connecting small generating units (1-25 MW) from the larger generating 
projects. They do understand the importance of allowing small units to get 
connected for production as early as this summer. Unfortunately, at this 
point they are obligated to take all requests on a first-come, first-serve 
basis. 

The Washington PUD Association has scheduled a meeting with BPA at SeaTac 
this Friday at 2 p.m. to discuss this situation. If anyone on this list wants 
to attend that meeting I will get more details. In the mean time, if your 
thinking of putting generation on the Northwest Federal transmission Network 
any time in the next few years, you should not delay applying to BPA.

1055,"By a letter in early January, the ISO told EPMI that FERC's order accepting 
the ISO's Tariff Amendment No. 33 had ordered EPMI to report to the ISO 
transactions above the price cap.  We reviewed the FERC Order and concluded 
that the FERC had imposed no such obligation.  We decided to do nothing 
rather than explain this in a letter to the ISO because the letter could be 
quoted out-of-context in the newspaper.  Moreover, it's my understanding that 
we have done no transactions over the cap, so, even if the ISO has correctly 
interpreted the tariff there would be nothing to provide the ISO.

The ISO is now threatening (see attached E-mail) to bring enforcement actions 
against parties that do not report to the ISO transactions above the price 
cap (whether or not the transactions are out-of-market).  I could do one of 
several things for you at this point:
Stay quiet
Send the letter (see attached letter to Eric Hilderbrandt)
Send the ISO a letter saying we haven't sold anything over the cap and will 
not report unless and until we do
Call the FERC hotline and ask them to get the ISO off our back
Ask Sue or Joe to mobilize some action by WPTF or EPSA

I am fearful that if we stay quiet, the ISO will put us on a list (like the 
""Dirty 13"" list) and we'll end up in the press again.  To lay low, I'm 
inclined to pursue options 3 or 4.  What do others think?  Traders - please 
verify my understanding about our transactions with the ISO.

Title: Atlantic Basin Heating Oil Markets Well Supplied Before Winter
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2800;


***********************************************************************

HIGH INVENTORIES AND WEAK JET DEMAND SHAPE THE HEATING OIL MARKET

Atlantic Basin heating oil markets are comfortably supplied in the lead-up to
the winter 2001/02 heating season, and accordingly CERA expects much weaker
distillate-to-crude price differentials than those of a year ago.

*  Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a
year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels
higher then last year.

*  Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery
distillate supply capability.

*  Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be
much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market
boosted distillate demand.

I spoke with Colin Skellett (CEO of Wessex and AZX's vice chairman) and Keith 
Harris (Wessex's CFO) late this morning.  Here are some thoughts coming out 
of this conversation:

Wessex is launching the ""heads of terms"" (Britspeak for detailed bullet-point 
term sheet) with their lawyers, who have the Kelda announcements and 
experience on having done this in the electric industry in the UK.
Colin and Keith's view is that you will be extremely helpful in looking at 
how this works in practice and being sure the commercial overview points (not 
necessarily water industry points) are being addressed, from the perspective 
of both the service and the asset companies though obviously principally from 
the service company viewpoint.
The broad schedule is to meet with the lawyers Monday July 10 in London to go 
over the format, after you've had some time to acquaint yourself with what 
you need to understand about Wessex or the UK water industry.  (Keith is 
confirming that date with the lawyers but believes it will work.)
After that meeting, the term sheet will be refined on an iterative basis, 
probably going to full contract draft without numbers in, so that all issues 
are on the table in advance of the AZX board meeting, which is set for Monday 
Aug 7.  (Note that we will probably do the asset/service separation 
regardless of whether we decide to monetize the asset piece in some form.)

We've set up a conference call, subject to your schedule, for 10:30am Houston 
time tomorrow (Wednesday June 28) to go over this game plan.  From there, 
given the US holiday and other items, it's sounding like this will work well 
with the timetable you and I discussed yesterday.  In particular:

You could fly over to the UK Wednesday night July 5, arriving Thursday, and 
spend perhaps Thursday pm and all day Friday with Wessex personnel learning 
more about their business.  (They have a fairly standard tour of customer 
center, laboratories, and water and wastewater treatment plants that could be 
organized and I think would give you a good overview of their facilities.)
On Monday we could meet in London.
You could fly back to the US Tuesday the 11th, making your meeting on 
Wednesday the 12th as planned.
You would have ongoing involvement, perhaps involving a further trip to the 
UK, before the AZX board meeting in August, and thereafter. 

Unfortunately, that leaves you with a weekend in the UK.  You'd have to 
endure a tour of the Roman baths (very fascinating), a weekend in the 
Cotswolds (30 minutes from Bath and Bristol), or go to London early 
(theaters, shopping).  What we all do for Enron.  

Please let me know if 10:30 Wednesday works for a conference call so that I 
can let the folks there know.  The UK is 6 hours ahead of the US, so if we 
need to push back later we can still do so, though it's getting into their 
evening if we go much past noon our time.

Sorry for the long message--I'm in a meeting late afternoon today and may not 
be available if you call.","Colin Skellett Keith

1082,"Justin & Paul,

We are seeking your sign-off and assistance in connection with a swap termi=
nation transaction that is part of an equity sale transaction that is prese=
ntly set to close this Thursday.  The good news is that the documentation h=
as been substantially negotiated by a number of internal and external lawye=
rs (in connection with the equity sale deal) and the swap termination deal =
terms have been discussed and blessed by Gary Hickerson's team in Houston.

The background and basics of the deal are as follows:

In March 1999 Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (""ECTRI"")=
 entered into a long-term interest rate swap with Greenfield Shipping Compa=
ny Limited (""GSCL"") in connection with GSCL's project financing of a 135,00=
0 cbm LNG tanker.  The swap was documented by way of an ISDA Master Agreeme=
nt (Multicurrency--Cross Border) and related Confirmation (Deal No. M148198=
), both dated 18 March 1999 (the ""Swap Transaction""), and ECTRI's obligatio=
ns under the swap were guaranteed by Enron Corp.  Enron, through its wholly=
-owned subsidiary Atlantic Commercial Finance Inc. (""ACFI""), owns a 20% int=
erest in Greenfield Holding Company Limited (""GHCL""), which in turn owns GS=
CL.  The LNG tanker was intended to be fully-employed in the transportation=
 of LNG to Enron's Dabhol, India facilities.

Due to an alleged default in GSCL's financing caused by the Dabhol project =
situation, GSCL's lenders' threats to accelerate the loan and foreclose upo=
n the vessel, and Enron's lack of desire to maintain an equity interest in =
the vessel, Enron (ACFI) now desires to sell its interest in GHCL to Mitsui=
 OSK Lines Ltd. (""MOL"") [for US$5 million] and have the Swap Transaction te=
rminated and the Enron Corp. Guarantee released.  ACFI and MOL entered into=
 a conditional Sale and Purchase Agreement on  23 October 2001 which provid=
es for the described equity sale, swap termination and guarantee release.  =
An electronic copy of the signed Sale & Purchase Agreement is attached for =
your reference. =20

The key terms of the deal that relate to the Swap Transaction are as follow=
s: (a) the Swap Transaction is to be terminated (and GSCL's Banks are to pr=
ovide their consent thereto) on 15/11/01; (b) the assumed swap termination =
cost at 23/10/01 was US$20 million which was used as a basis for the Loan N=
ote calculation; (c) ECTRI is to receive US$4 million out of the sale proce=
eds as a down payment against the agreed swap breakage cost, with GSCL exec=
uting a Loan Note in favor of ECTRI for 80% of the balance of the agreed sw=
ap breakage cost (note that ECTRI has 20% of the upside/downside exposure i=
n the event the actual breakage cost varies from US$20 million [US$1 millio=
n for every US$5 million in actual break cost movement]), (d) the Loan Note=
 is to be guaranteed by MOL (Enron Houston Credit Dept. has signed off on M=
OL as an acceptable credit risk) and is to be fully repaid on the earlier t=
o occur of vessel refinancing or 30 April 2002; and (e) Enron Corp. is to b=
e released from its Guarantee obligations in respect of the original Swap T=
ransaction.  The swap is scheduled to be terminated at 9:30 am New York tim=
e on Thursday, Nov. 15.  The amount of the total breagage cost, as well as =
the Loan Note amount may then be calculated and inserted into documents (1)=
 and (2) referenced below.=20

John LaMaster and Mathew Kidwell of Vinson & Elkins represented ACFI, Ian A=
ndrews and Sabien Vermeulen of Linklaters represented GHCL/GSCL in connecti=
on with financing issues and Dan Bradshaw of Johnson, Stokes & Master (Hong=
 Kong) represented MOL.  GSCL's lenders are represented by a team led by Ha=
rry Theochari of Norton Rose.  Peter Anderson, Jordan Mintz and I worked on=
 the equity sale and swap break transaction and have cleared the terms of t=
he swap break transaction with Gary Hickerson and his team in Houston.  Jim=
 Hughes has also signed off on the terms of the equity sale and has agreed =
with Gary Hickerson as to how to internally handle any termination proceeds=
 shortfall.

I attach electronic copies of the following documents, for which we seek yo=
ur sign-off in connection with the equity sale transaction that is presentl=
y set for closing on this Thursday:

1.=09Swap Termination Letter Agreement between ECTRI and GSCL;
2.=09Loan Note 2002 made by GSCL in favor of ECTRI;
3.=09Deed of Guarantee made by MOL in favor of ECTRI;=20
4.=09Deed of Release made by GSCL in favor of Enron Corp.; and
5.=09Certificate of Assistant Secretary of ECTRI [required by GSCL's lender=
s].

Your assistance in signing-off on these documents, as well as helping to ob=
tain any necessary signatures of personnel based in London (I'm assuming th=
at  ECTRI's agent, Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited, must sign in Lon=
don) would be most appreciated.  Of course, I'm happy to respond to any que=

1087,"Hey guys!  It's been a long time, I hope everyone is doing well especially 
since I know it's the end of bid week and it's Friday.  Just thought you 
might enjoy some of the things I've learned since I've been here about the 
English language.   Hopefully they'll give you chuckle.  

There are differences between British English and American English that I've 
noticed so far:

Pants are ""trousers.""  Don't make the mistake that I did:   I wrote, ""Black 
Pants, Brown Pants, Khaki Pants"" on my dry cleaning inventory to turn into 
the dry cleaners and got reminded that I was turning in ""trousers"" not pants 
with a smirk.  ""Pants"" are what they call underwear here.  Also, I almost 
fell over in my chair laughing one day when a girl in my group said ""PANTS!"" 
and hit her hand on the desk when her computer crashed.  Apparentely, it's 
the equivalent of saying ""CRAP!""

I went to the grocery store around the block and I was looking to buy some 
orange juice.  On the outside of some of the containers it said ""with extra 
bits"" and some said ""no bits.""  I was puzzled until my boyfriend explained 
that it was ""with pulp"" or ""without pulp.""  

When I go to restaurants I have to remember that fries are ""chips"" on the 
menu (even at McDonalds), and chips are called ""crisps.""  If you want to get 
a baked potato it's called a ""jacket potato.""    And if you want mashed 
potatoes, just say ""mash.""  One of the favorite dishes at the pubs (not bars) 
here is ""bangers and mash"" which translates to sausages links and mashed 
potatoes.  

Here are a few more of the oddities:

You don't stand in line here, you ""stand in queue.""
Trash cans are ""bins.""  It's amusing to hear someone say, ""I don't want it- 
just bin it.""
Country boy or redneck types are called ""wide boys"" or ""barrow boys.""
When you spell things out loud, Z is pronounced ""zed"" and H is pronounced 
""haitch.""
Cross walks are ""zebra crossings""  since they are signified by white stripes 
on the road.  (Pronounced ZEB-bra, not ZEE-bra)
Panty hose are called ""tights"" regardless of their thickness.
Good  is pronounced ""goote.""
Yards no matter how big or small are all called gardens regardless of the 
fact that they're not growing any vegetables in them.

Well, I guess that's about it for the English lesson for today.  I hope you 
are all doing great and I'll try to do better about sending updates.

Cheers!  ( ""Thanks"")

Here is one statistical method (linear regression), applied to Hosanna's fund 
giving. The method is deterministic, where contributions each Sunday are 
attempted to be explained by significant events on the church's and members' 
calendars, and the method shoudl be considered in contrast to an anecdotal 
one, where each Sunday's giving might be estimated to be the average giving 
of the same Sunday (e.g., each 2nd Sunday in January) in the past.

The following effects are estimated independently by the computer (they add 
and subtract with each other accordingly; some Sundays can have more than one 
effect ""in play""):

1) most positive for giving: an additional +$8,802 for special pastoral 
appeals (3 of them in the past 3 years)

2) positive for giving: an additional +$2,551 Easter and nearest- Christmas 
""Sunday,"" an additional +$59 Thanksgiving Sunday, and a tiny additional +$1 
each week pure time trend.

3) negative for giving: -$304 for Sundays of Monday Federal Holiday weekends, 
and -$9 during the Summer (June 1-Aug 31)

4) ""wave"": there  is an $80 per week ""wave""- giving $80 higher one week, $80 
lower the next, etc ...

The computer can explain roughly 60% of the absolute variation in giving the 
past 3 years using this approach. Keep in mind, much of the information, 
statistically, is captured in the pastoral appeals, Easter and Christmas 
Sundays, and Holiday weekends. The rest of the variation cannot be explained 
by this simple model (i.e., it looks like ""noise"").

Here are the predictions for fund giving for the upcoming year. You can 
cut-and-paste these numbers to any file or spreadsheet  you like. They may 
seem ""boring"" to you; please remember they are the deterministic components 
of a process that involves a lot of volatility, and your church's actual 
experience will predictably be volatile. These numbers are as-if the ""means"" 
of  experiences dependent on the ""standard deviations.""

My name is Jeanne Anne Klein and I am a financial modeler working with 
Mingcheng Lian on a high profile pipeline project in China. 

Zimin Lu referred us to you regarding questions we have on the Real Option 
Valuation Approach.  We are very enthusiastic about what we have read and 
heard about this valuation method.

We have been doing some preliminary research on the Real Option Valuation 
approach and believe that integrating this approach into our financial model 
would bring a significant increase to the value to the project.   We have 
identified some deal aspects we believe would be ideal to valuate as real 
options.  Our goal is to work with the development team to structure the deal 
to incorporate the Real Option Valuation approach into the model enabling us 
to arrange the contracts within the deal to optimize the project's value.

We would like to arrange a meeting with you at your ealiest convenience to 
brainstorm on additional deal aspects that can be valued using the real 
option approach as well as on ways to quantify these aspects using the Real 
Option valuation Method. 

Please advise if you will be able to meet with us within the next week or 
two. 

Thank you for your kind attention,

Thanks for the timely email.   I have your name on my list of people to 
contact this week as Kevin Hannon had mentioned to me just yesterday that our 
group might be able to help you in translating positions for the new risk 
system for EBS.    

You are right that I haven't been spending much time on 44.   Martin Lin has 
been taking the lead in day to day management of most of the current projects 
that we are supporting.   We have been somewhat short handed since Samer 
Takriti left the group last fall and we were out-bid by McKinsey for Cantekin 
Dincerler who had helped us with EBS projects as an intern over the 
summer.    However, we do have additional help coming.   Iris Mack, a very 
bright new hire who comes with significant consulting and risk management 
experience, will be starting with the group next week.   I am hoping that, 
together with Martin, she will allow us to significantly increase the 
research group presence on 44 and address areas which are currently 
undersupported.

Can I get on your schedule some time next week in order to map out the areas 
where we could best contribute to the risk management projects and to 
introduce Iris and Martin to you?   Almost any time would be fine, or you can 
have your assistant coordinate with Shirley Crenshaw x35290.

A short follow up on the P+ options.

Attached is a chart showing historical correlations for calendar spreads 
between futures contracts.   It shows correlation over four different time 
horizons up to the roll of the nearest contract in each pair.   As you can 
see the level is usually higher than 0.98 and often near 0.99.    If our 
current book of ""index P+"" options were re-marked at a 98% correlation, it

Overview: WESTERN ENERGY=01*CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR STAYS THE COURSE
California governor Gray Davis provided his strongest public statements to=
=20
date regarding the state=01,s power crisis in his annual State of the State=
=20
Address on January 8, 2001. Echoing many of his previous positions on what =
he=20
perceives as a flawed and unfair California market structure, the governor=
=20
labeled the state=01,s electricity market system a colossal and dangerous=
=20
failure. Among other actions, he launched new initiatives valued at $1=20
billion to encourage conservation, provide financing and land to new=20
generators, grant authority to utilities to engage in a portfolio of=20
transactions to manage electricity costs, and increase regulatory scrutiny =
of=20
existing market suppliers. The governor also called for a greater role for=
=20
the state in overseeing and constructing new power plants.

The governor acknowledged that the actions proposed are only some of the=20
steps necessary to put California on the road to recovery. Details regardin=

sources of funding for the initiative are still forthcoming. Although he=20
stated that California=01,s investor-owned utilities must not be allowed to=

bankrupt, no formal plan for ensuring their solvency was given. The financi=

community continues to lack the assurance it requires to continue to provid=
e=20
financial backing for Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California=20
Edison. At this time the state legislature remains the body most likely to=
=20
guarantee their solvency.

The governor again criticized the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for=
=20
what he believes has been its failure to manage and restrain properly the=
=20
wholesale market. Merchant plant generators were accused of gouging the=20
state, and it was suggested that these generators acted illegally in their=
=20
operations, jeopardizing the reliability of the power grid. New, more sever=
e=20
sanctions were promised for those caught withholding power or extracting wh=
at=20
investigators find as unreasonable profits.

A Los Angeles Times poll released the morning before the governor=01,s addr=

indicated that the majority of Californians still do not believe there is a=

the West Desk.  The differences in the markets between East and West are, in 
Tim's opinion, sufficient that he does not need an approach as sophisticated 
as the one we are pursuing for ERCOT.  In particular, the termal limits for 
which load flows are so useful are not generally binding in the West.  Loop 
flows are also not considered a major issue at present.

In summary, it seems that the West is an unlikely customer of any extension 
to an ERCOT/East transmission model for the time being.  They have also done 
little in this area that would directly relate to our efforts here.

The following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred 
Friday, December 15
  1.  Energy Secretary Richardson issuance of an emergency order.
      (Richardson's statement and FPA Section 202(c) order is posted on DOE's 
Web site at:
       http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases00/decpr/pr00309.html )

http://www.eei.org/issues/news/cal1215order.pdf)

                                  California Supplies Ordered by Richardson

o Richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to California ISO
o Order is effective as soon as ISO certifies shortage, but ends 12/21/00, 
unless extended
o Prices to be agreed to by supplier and ISO, or FERC will set rate later
o FPA emergency power authority transferred to DOE in 1977

As he said he would on December 13, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson found ""an emergency exists in California by reason of the shortage 
of electric energy"" and issued an emergency order under section 202 (c) of 
the Federal Power Act (FPA) requiring listed generators and marketers to 
provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the 
California ISO.  In a statement, Richardson said the threat to the 
reliability of the California grid requires a long-term solution, but that in 
the short-term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts.

The 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the ISO certifies to DOE that it 
has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing 
requested service to the ISO.  The ISO must inform each supplier subject to 
the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9:00 PM, 
Eastern Standard Time, the day before the services are needed.  The order 
directs the ISO to allocate, to the extent feasible, requested services among 
subject entities in proportion to each supplier's available excess power.  
The order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3:00 AM, Eastern 
Time, December 21, 2000, unless extended.  To continue to obtain supplies 
under this emergency authority, the ISO must re-certify the shortage to DOE 
headquarters every 24 hours.

The terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers 
to the ISO ""are to be agreed to by the parties.""  If no agreement is reached, 
then under the FPA's emergency authority Secretary Richardson ""will 
immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a determination at a later date 
by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures, and will 
prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and 
reasonable.""  The authority of FERC to set rates for power supplied under 
emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do 
not agree to a rate is explicitly included in FPA Section 202(c).  The DOE 
Organization Act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section 
from FERC to DOE.

The 76 entities identified in the order's attachment are all the entities 
that have provided power to the ISO over the last 30 days.  Those entities 
are ordered ""to make arrangements to generate, deliver, interchange, and 
transmit electric energy when, as, and in such amounts as may be requested by 
the"" ISO, ""acting as agent for and on behalf of Scheduling Coordinators.""

             FERC De-Federalizes California Markets, Adopts Other Structural 
Reforms
                  A summary of the December 15 Order and Commission Discussion

At its special meeting today, FERC unanimously approved its eagerly awaited 
final order reforming the California wholesale markets, adopting the major 
outlines of its November 1 proposed order and sending back to California the 
responsibility for addressing state-related matters, as discussed below.  At 
the same time, FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as 
well as the imposition of region-wide price caps.

FERC reiterated the November 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances, 
California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates 
due to California's ""seriously flawed"" market structure and rules in 
conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West.

While all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus-based outcome 
that appropriately balanced all competing interests, each commissioner 
expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order.  Chairman 
Hoecker and Comm. Breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement, while Comms. 
Hebert and Massey laid out their positions where they believed the Commission 
had either ""over-reached"" or not gone far enough, just as they did on 
November 1, as discussed below.

Highlights of key actions:

(1) FERC adopted the November 1 proposal to eliminate, effective immediately, 
the state's mandatory requirement that the state's investor-owned utilities 
buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allow these utilities to 
purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative 
mechanisms to manage supply risks.  FERC terminated the PX's rate schedules 
effective at the close of business on April 30, 2001.  In effect, as Chairman 
Hoecker stated, the order de-federalizes 60 percent of the California 
wholesale market established under the state's restructuring law, returning 
ratemaking authority over company-owned generation to the California Public 
Utilities Commission (CPUC).

(2) FERC modified the effective period of the November 1 $150/MWh ""soft cap"" 
proposal, limiting its application through April 2001, whereupon a 
""comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which 
incorporates appropriate thresholds, screen and mitigation measures"" must be 
in place.  In a related move, FERC ordered a technical conference early next 
year to develop such a program by March 1, 2001, so that these measures can 
be place by the May 1, deadline.

In a major modification, FERC revised the refund conditions to clarify that 
while certain refund conditions will continue to apply, unless FERC issues 
written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under 
review, refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days.

As proposed, however, supply bids in excess of $150 will be prohibited from 
setting the market-clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above 
$150/MWh will be required to report their bids to FERC on a confidential, 
weekly basis and provide certain cost support.

(3) FERC adopted the November 1 proposal to require the establishment of 
independent, non-stakeholder governing board for the ISO.  The ISO Governing 
Board must relinquish their decision-making power and operating control to 
the ISO management on January 29, 2001.  A future order will set procedures 
for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process.

(4) In a major modification, FERC adopted a $74/MWh ""price benchmark"" for 
assessing prices of five-year energy supply contracts.  This benchmark will 
be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of 
pricing long-term contracts.

To facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable 
rates, FERC announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market 
participants.

(5) FERC adopted the November 1 proposal to require market participants to 
schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day-ahead market and 
instituting a penalty charge for under-scheduling (in excess of five percent 
of hourly load requirements), in order to discourage over-reliance on the 
real-time spot market.

(6) FERC directed the ISO and the three investor-owned utilities to file 
generation interconnection standards.

(7) FERC affirmed the longer-term measures proposed in the November 1 order, 
including submission of a congestion management design proposal by April 2, 
2001.

(8) FERC deferred resolving key issues, including establishing new ISO board 
selection procedures, developing appropriate market monitoring measures and 
negotiating protective orders associated with data collection.

(9) FERC reiterated its November 1 call to California policy makers there to 
resolve state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability 
of day ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand 
responses; (3) siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of 
sufficient reserve requirements.

Commissioner Responses

Comm. Hebert reluctantly concurred, calling the final order a ""missed 
opportunity"" to, among other things, send appropriate signals for new 
generation siting and conservation.  Reiterating his November 1 concerns, 
Hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the Commission 
should and should not have adopted.  While expressing pleasure at the tone of 
the order (""balanced and considerate""), the bid certainly reversal, and the 
role reserved for the state in the selection of the new ISO board, Hebert 
nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order, which 
he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low.  Hebert faulted the Commission 
for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the November 8 order 
approving the CA ISO's emergency $250/MWh ""soft cap"" proposal.  Hebert ended 
by challenging the CPUC to do what it can to encourage utilities there to 
forward contract, including easing the existing prudence review requirements.

Comm. Breathitt endorsed the Order, reiterating her support for progress 
towards open and competitive markets.  She noted that the Order properly 
""walked the line"" by taking all of the competing interests into account, 
calling it less than ideal, but a step in the right direction.  She also 
concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will 
be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of 
the $150/MWh breakpoint.  Additionally she mentioned that any price below the 
$74/MWh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable.

Comm. Massey concurred, but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for 
California ratepayers, stating that he felt that market power had been 
exercised, that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers 
had profited too much at the expense of others in the market.  He warned 
that, as he understood the legal precedents, the Federal Courts were poised 
to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on 
to consumers.  On the positive side, he approved of the de-federalization of 
60% of the market and the creation of long term contracts.  However, he 
emphasized that California regulators must now take the responsibility of 
creating more generation and transmission.  In the long term, Comm. Massey 
hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference 
and that the market would have rules more like PJM.

Finally, Comm. Massey articulated what he would have liked to have done 
differently.  He stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not 
enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the 
on-going investigation.  He also disagreed with the $150/MWh breakpoint, 
preferring instead a hard price per generator.  The Commissioner said he 
would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and 
that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the West.  Finally, 
he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds.

Chairman Hoecker began his comments by saying that the Commission was forced 
to act  and act quickly because the stakes are so high.  He feels that it is 
now time for the state regulators and markets to act.  He noted that by 
shrinking the Cal PX, the responsibility is now with the CPUC to fashion the 
long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the 
least amount of damage to the utilities.  In regards to suggestions for a 
regional price cap, the Chairman stated that this would not work due to the 
fact that the Commission has no jurisdiction over Bonneville, WAPA and the 
public power producers and that there is no spot market in the Northwest.  
However, he did urge Secretary Richardson to convene a conference in order to 
address regional issues.  Finally, in conceptually addressing the California 
situation, the Chairman stated that competition or ""deregulation"" did not 
fail in California, but that there never was competition in California.

1192,"Hi Vince,

 Amitava and I have received a request to build a non-firm power curve for 
each region from David Hoog's Double Trigger folks.  The objective, as they 
explain it, is to allow the Desk to buy non-firm from the market, buy David's 
outage product, and sell firm to the market.  Accountants would like a curve 
to mark the non-firm position.
 My initial thought is that the desk should provide this non-firm curve, but 
it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they 
have put the ball in David Hoog's court to build the curve if David wants to 
sell his product internally to the desk.  
 Assuming we build the curve, the next issue is how to define ""non-firm""?  
The only way I can think of is to tie the non-firmness to a specific 
generation unit or group of units.  This will allow the purchase of David's 
outage product to cover the non-firmness risk.  Tying the definition of 
non-firmness to a whole region seems implausible ",Vince Amitava David Hoog's David,,

The article on the natural gas market is just what I've been looking for.
The new addition, coupled with the first version's discussion of the
volatility of the gas market in the mid 90's should be very helpful in
convincing these government watchdog types that basis adjustments in
pricing formulas are not some sinister plot to deprive the feds of their
royalties.  Or should if there is any rationality in government.

1207,"Dear all,

I followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows:-

1) USE LESS DATA

Unfortunately, kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less 
robust, in fact dramatically so, and so eliminates the possibility of using 
less data.  The model tested was the RPI(month+15) & Deviations from 
long-term average for Brent Crude.  The r-squared and F-statistic collapsed 
by eliminating the first 12 months of data.

2) DEVIATIONS IN CRUDE VARIABLE

Shifting the crude explanatory variable backwards and forward by 3 and 6 
months did not alter the model goodness-of-fit parameters dramatically and so 
my suggestion is that we stick with the following model:

PLLU[t] = a.RPI[t] + b.RPI[t+15] + c.BrentCrudeDeviations[t] + Constant

3) TESTING MODEL WITH SINE WAVE

To gauge the response of the model to wildly-varying RPI forward curve, a 
sine wave of period 3 years for RPI was input into the PPI model.  The result 
was as expected; PPI pre-empts the moves in RPI by about 8 months.  The 
magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced.  This shows that if we had 
more detail in our RPI forward curve, then the PPI model would reflect those 
peaks and humps adequately.



CONCLUSION

I therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates RPI, RPI[t+15] 
and deviations of Brent Crude from long-term average.  The new model is 
plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old PPI which is 
depicted in blue. 

The new model achieves the two main objectives of the PPI curve: it is 
significantly more robust and stable than the existing one, and it is 
considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients, which results in us 
having more confidence in our monthly P&L.


Please note that all this analysis only applies to PLLU, and that a separate 
study will be needed for the DZCV PPI index.

Regards,

Anjam

weekend! SRS :-)


First Important Lesson - Everyone's job is important

During my second month of nursing school, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I 
was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions, until I 
read the last one:

""What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?""

Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several 
times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50's, but how would I know her 
name? I left the question blank.

Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count 
toward our quiz grade. ""Absolutely,"" said the professor. ""In your careers, 
you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention 
and care, even if all you do is smile and say 'hello'.""

""I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.


Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain

One night, at 11:30 PM, an older African American woman was standing on the 
side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had 
broken down and she desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to 
flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her, generally 
unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s.

The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi 
cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry, but   wrote down his address and 
thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door. To his 
surprise, a giant  onsole color TV was delivered to his home.

A special note was attached. It read: ""Thank you so much for assisting me on 
the highway the other night. The rain  drenched not only my clothes, but also 
my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make it to my 
dying husband's bedside just before he passed away. God bless you for helping 
me and unselfishly serving others."" Sincerely, Mrs. Nat King Cole.

Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve.

In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy 
entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of 
water in front of him. ""How much is an ice cream sundae?"" he asked.

""Fifty cents,"" replied the waitress.

The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it. 
""Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?"" he inquired.

By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing 
impatient. ""Thirty-five cents,"" she brusquely  replied.""

The little boy again counted his coins. ""I'll have the plain ice cream,"" he 
said. The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and 
walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left.

When the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. 
There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies 
-- You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left 
to leave her a tip.

Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path

In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid 
himself and watched to see if anyone would  remove the huge rock.  

Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply 
walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads 
clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way. 

Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the 
boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the 
side of the road. 

After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant 
picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed  a purse lying in the road where 
the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins ad a note from the 
king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from 
the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand: 

Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.

Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts 

Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a 
little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her 
only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year 
old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed 
the antibodies needed to combat the illness.

The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the 
little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. 

I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, 
""Yes, I'll do it if it will save her.""

As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, 
as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew 
pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a 
trembling  voice, ""Will I start to die right away?""

Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was 
going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.

You see, after all, understanding and attitude, are everything.",Dorothy God Nat King Cole Liz,"Fifty cents Thirty-five cents two nickels and five pennies

1239,"Terry was acting with full coordination from Jose.  The problem was this: 
Daly insisted someone speak on behalf of the group to the press (and 
designated Terry to be the one); Terry did not have the updated information 
that we were about to meet with the government officials and deliver a 
slightly different message (i.e. that we needed to know if the government 
planned to really open Petrobras or not -- the implication being that we 
would work within either decision but we needed to know one way or the 
other); Terry was simply not in possession of this information and no one had 
given it to him (probably because they had no reason to assume that Terry 
would be thrust in front of the press); moreover, it's hard to see how Terry 
could have taken such a position publicly anyway.  By my eyes Terry did the

preaching to the choir, and we (as I am sure others do as well) have a string 
of proposals starting with SDGEs in May or June that, if we melded their 
timing and their prices into the attached timeline would be very damaging to 
thinking people.  However, are people really thinking, or has Davis and the 
reporters tainted the waters too badly?  What would be the result that we 
would like to get from such an exposee?  Do we really think that we could get 
some sympathy for returning to a market based structure?  Or, would we be 
like the irritating kid who keeps saying ""I told you so"", so it does not 
matter if he was right or not?  Are there any legal issues in revealing the 
prices?  Does doing this through IEP help?  (Note that the addition of prices 
could not be done, I do not think,  without naming companies, so we would be 
there, partially revealed.)

My vote:  if it does not hurt us (competitively, PR, etc.), if it is legal, 
and especially if it can help make even a small amout of progress towards a 
market based structure, I would do it.  Of course, we could not go anymore to 
restaurants near the CPUC......

I am out of town for the rest of the week, so I will leave the decision to 
you guys.  Whatever you decide, is OK.

PS - At the very least, we should feed our own proposals and their prices 
into this timeline.  Privately, we could show it to various parties on a case 
by case basis to advance our cause.  Just think about it...  what if SDGE had 
accepted our (and others) May/June proposals for 5.5 cents.....?)

governor has signed SB 28X, a power plant siting bill.  Yesterday, the 
governor signed bond financing bill SB 31X.  Once the extraordinary session 
is closed, a new extraordinary session is expected to be opened immediately.  
However, sources report that no one is certain if the bills from this session 
will have the same numbers in the next session.  The legislature reportedly 
is trying to arrange so that the bills will not have to be heard again in 
committee.

? The MOU still does not have a sponsor.  Governor Davis hopes to reach a 
deal with Sempra for the state to purchase San Diego Gas and Electric's 
transmission assets.  He reportedly feels that by having deals in place with 
SoCal and SDG&E, enough momentum might be added to push the MOU through the 
legislature.  He then could go to the bankruptcy court and propose adding 
PG&E's assets, since he would have two of the three pieces in place.  The 
validity of this logic seems questionable at best.  Sources are skeptical 
that adding SDG&E to the MOU would increase the chances of the deal going 
through the legislature.  Also, the governor has claimed to be close to 
having a deal with SDG&E for several weeks, but such a deal has not yet been 
finalized.  The governor stated that he will have a sponsor for the MOU by 
next week when the bill will be introduced.  The MOU might be introduced in 
the legislature, then amended to indicate a lesser amount for the 
transmission asset purchase.  This still would not assure passage since so 
many legislators reportedly are against the MOU.

? The windfall profits tax bill has not been set for hearing on the Assemble 
floor.  

? State Legislature, Elizabeth Hill, published a report earlier this week 
regarding an analysis of state revenues.  The report stated that revenues for 
this year would be $3.4B less that was expected in January 2001, not 
including electricity costs.  She predicts that ongoing state programs will 
have to be cut by approximately $1.7B.

? Moody's has put California's credit rating under review for another 
downgrade.  Sources report that Moody's, S&P, and MBIA have all informed

has advised Enron that MERC has no jurisdiction over the PPA and cannot 
establish regulations on things like merit order dispatch, much less set the

thought of the Linklaters attorneys (both Sandeep Katwala and Chris Walker)

jurisdiction over the renegotiated PPA (which it will) and must approve it; 
thus, it may be better to take the offensive and challenge its jurisdiction 
over merit order dispatch.    The strategy isn't fully formed yet, but I

OUR CURRENT energy problems are urgent and serious. But before the governor 
and the Public Utilities Commission cut yet another deal costing consumers 
billions of dollars, perhaps they should pause to ask the public what kind of 
system it wants and what it will end up with after investing billions more. 
Failure of energy deregulation could speed real deregulation that might 
benefit consumers with real capacity and real competition. But this will not 
happen if the focus is only on California utilities and their shareholders. 
The original deregulation deal was designed, as I see it, to keep competition 
out of California -- and to maximize the rates consumers would pay for every 
bad past business decision by PG&E and other California utilities. 
Similarly, current bailout discussions are about forcing California 
ratepayers to pay for the failed deregulation plan designed by the utilities 
themselves. Once again, the companies seek to maximize profits and socialize 
the losses. 
Following on the heels of California's deregulation, the state's utilities 
came to the congressional delegation and urged us to protect the plan from 
federal deregulation efforts. They argued that the deal they cut was good for 
all parties. Their executives repeated time and again that they might benefit 
from the plan's cap on consumer prices -- and that there was a risk to them 
if wholesale prices were to go up. 
This, they told us, is the marketplace. They were willing to absorb the risk. 
This was the brave new world of free markets. 
But markets are never free. From the beginning, this deregulation plan was 
designed to buy the California utilities time and advantage. Initially, 
consumers saw lower rates, but not as low as real competition might have 
provided when compared to the heavily sheltered market of the past five 
years. Now, because this rigged marketplace has failed, the utilities want 
again to put their hands into the ratepayers' pockets. 
At first, PG&E and Southern California Edison asked the Public Utilities 
Commission to have California consumers pay the entire cost of deregulation's 
risks. Their idea did not pass the smell or the laugh test. 
Now the utilities look for a way to repackage their old proposal, including a 
substantial rate increase. The rationale is that the utilities may collapse 
financially. This threat is supposed to inspire Gov. Gray Davis and the PUC 
to quickly put the ratepayer on the hook for the utilities' failures. 
During the past year, dozens of utilities have merged all across America. 
PG&E, for example, may not be worth much to its shareholders, but like AT&T, 
it may be worth something to its competitors. This is the genius of the 
American marketplace. 
PG&E shareholders bought the stock, assuming the risk. Why should the 
ratepayers be asked to insulate them from that risk? During this past year, 
tens of billions of dollars of market capitalization were lost by various 
Silicon Valley high-tech firms. Their shareholders do not get the benefit of 
going to the PUC and getting a taxpayer bailout. 
The ratepayer has already paid for this energy under a contract that 
utilities struck with the people of the state of California. Any additional 
payment by the ratepayer is a financial bailout. Any prudent investor would 
ask what the return will be before handing over billions of dollars. The 
ratepayer deserves an answer, as well as some equity or other consideration.

Contracts to ease blow of rise in fuel prices helping airlines 
Hedging your jets 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Faced with higher gasoline prices in the past year, consumers lamented the 
bite that rising oil prices were taking from their wallets. 
Other than driving less or buying cars that use less gas, there wasn't much 
they could do. 
Airlines, which consume billions of gallons of jet fuel a year, also felt the 
sting as prices fluctuated. 
But airlines, unlike drivers, can use financial tools to ease the pain of 
volatile fuel prices. 
As airlines begin rolling out their fourth-quarter earnings reports in the 
next few weeks, those that ""hedged"" on fuel are likely to show better profits 
than those that didn't. 
Not only was that the case last year, but it will continue to be the case if 
jet-fuel and oil prices remain high. 
Gary Kelly, chief financial officer at low-fare Southwest Airlines in Dallas, 
says hedging is ""insurance against a catastrophic rise in fuel prices that 
would put us at unacceptable earnings levels."" 
Hedges aren't agreements to buy fuel. They are financial contracts pegged to 
the prices of oil and oil products, such as heating oil and jet fuel. 
If airlines buy the contracts at the right prices, they can collect cash to 
compensate them when jet fuel goes up. 
Successful hedging didn't stop airlines from raising ticket prices last year 
to help cover rising fuel costs. But, airlines say, the increases might have 
been higher without hedging. 
When the industry's fuel bill for 2000 is tallied, it is expected to be $13 
billion -- 50 percent higher than the previous year's $8.5 billion, according 
to a recent report from airline stock analysts at Merrill Lynch. At the same 
time, the airlines used only 4 percent more fuel. 
If the industry hadn't hedged, fuel expenses would have been $2 billion to $3 
billion higher, the analysts wrote. AMR Corp., the parent of Fort Worth-based 
American Airlines, the No. 2 domestic carrier, is expected to save $550 
million alone because of its hedging, they noted. 
Airlines don't like wild spikes in fuel prices because they make it difficult 
to plan and they jeopardize profits. 
A consumer would face the same dilemma if one month's apartment rent was 
$600, the next it jumped to $1,200 and the next it fell to $800. 
That's similar to what airlines faced the past year as the benchmark price of 
jet fuel, which is made from crude oil, fluctuated widely on the spot market. 
It was above 88 cents a gallon in March, dipped below 66 cents in April, rose 
to almost $1.10 in September and was just over 78 cents the last week in 
December. 
Airlines hedge to help smooth out such ups and downs. 
Greg Hartford, vice president for fuel at Houston-based Continental Airlines, 
looks to hedging ""to take volatility out of the market, not to second-guess 
it."" 
There are a variety of hedging tools. Some, just like car or home insurance, 
require upfront premiums. 
Hedging can be done through futures exchanges, such as the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, or through institutions, including banks, investment 
houses and energy traders such as Houston-based Enron Corp. 
Hedging is about managing risk, said Bill Berkeland, manager of trading for 
Enron North America, an Enron Corp. subsidiary. Techniques to cope with fuel 
price risks have been around probably 20 years, he said, but airlines didn't 
adopt them until the last decade. 
Airline hedging has gained more attention recently because of jet-fuel price 
spikes, he said. Some carriers will be able to take victory laps for being 
smart enough to hedge, he added, while others will simply blame fuel prices 
for their earnings problems. 
Hedges are bought for specific amounts of product and time: 2 million barrels 
a month for the next three months, for example. They can be pegged to the 
prices of crude oil, heating oil or jet fuel. 
Continental generally sticks to three basic types of hedges -- swaps, caps 
and collars. Hartford outlined the way each works: 
? Swap: A swap is one of the simplest types. It essentially locks in the cost 
of energy at a specific price for a certain time. No upfront payments are 
required. 
For example, an airline takes out a swap for 1 million barrels of crude oil 
at $25 a barrel for February. If the price averages $28 during February, the 
airline is paid $3 million -- the difference between $28 and $25 a barrel for 
the million barrels. 
But if the cost averages $22 a barrel, the airline must pay $3 million. 
? Cap: With caps, airlines purchase ""call options"" that protect them when 
prices rise but don't penalize them if prices drop. Caps, however, require 
upfront premium costs, which are based on a variety of factors. 
For example, an airline buys a crude-oil cap at $25 a barrel for 1 million 
barrels for February. If at month's end, oil averaged $28 a barrel, the 
airline collects $3 million. 
If it averaged $22, the airline gains nothing but loses nothing. Its cost: 
the upfront price-per-gallon premium. 
? Collar: A collar is more complex. It involves buying two different tools 
that create a price range -- essentially a minimum and maximum. The airline 
benefits if fuel goes above the range's high end but pays if it goes below 
the minimum. It can be set up so no premium is paid. 
Intuitively, it would seem to make sense for airlines to hedge on jet fuel. 
But the market for trading jet fuel isn't as liquid, or as strong, as the one 
for crude oil. 
So airlines look for something that correlates to jet-fuel prices. Heating 
oil is often best, followed by crude oil. 
There are trade-offs. Premiums for jet-fuel hedges are more expensive than 
those for heating oil. In turn, heating-oil hedges are more expensive than 
crude. But using crude oil as a hedge may not smooth volatility as much 
because of fluctuations in the relationship between crude and jet fuel. 
In the first part of 1999, when crude oil traded for around $12 a barrel, 
Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines started buying hedging contracts pegged to 
heating oil as far as 36 months out, said Joe Kolshak, director of investor 
relations at the third-largest U.S. airline. 
Delta's strategy has served it well. For the quarter that ended Sept. 30, 
hedging, including premium costs, saved the Atlanta-based carrier from paying 
an extra $160 million in fuel costs, he said. Even with that gain, Delta 
still paid 37 percent more for fuel over the same period than the year 
before. 
For the Sept. 30 quarter and the four preceding it, Delta had net hedging 
gains of $600 million. 
Hedging gains also helped balance sheets at other airlines, including No. 5 
Continental and No. 7 Southwest. 
Southwest's Kelly said the airline's hedging last year met its goal of 
protecting against catastrophic fuel-price rises. In the third quarter, 
operating profits rose $43.1 million because of hedging. 
During the same quarter, Continental gained $27 million from hedging. For 
1999, it was $105 million. 
Hedging isn't without risk. Airlines can predict the wrong way and lose 
millions. And when prices are already sky-high, certain hedging contracts 
won't be attractive because they, too, are pegged to higher prices. 
""Hedging is not a panacea, and it's not the golden elixir that people might 
consider it to be,"" Continental's Hartford said.

BOMBAY, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The Indian government has asked the western state 
of Maharashtra to work out ways to pay outstanding dues to U.S. energy giant 
Enron Corp (NYSE:ENE - news), media reports said on Sunday.

Enron has threatened to invoke letters of credit (LC) and the federal 
government's counter guarantee.

``The state government has to work on the issue,'' the Press Trust of India 
said, quoting unnamed official sources.

The Economic Times on Sunday said that the lenders to Enron's local unit, 
Dabhol Power Company, were meeting on Tuesday in New York to discuss the 
inability of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) to clear its dues.

``As a result of MSEB's mounting dues Enron said it would be forced to invoke 
the LC,'' the newspaper said.

The report said the MSEB had outstanding dues worth 2.62 billion rupees 
($56.15 million).

Enron's local unit said on Friday it will lower tariffs from next month in a 
bid to defuse criticism that it charges higher rates for the electricity it 
produces in Maharashtra state.

Last month, the Maharashtra government decided to review the rate at which it 
buys power from Enron's Dabhol Power, saying the high cost was threatening 
its finances.

Enron is spending about $1.9 billion to build a facility to generate 2,184 MW 
of electricity.

India, which needs to generate an additional 100,000 MW of power within the 
next decade to meet growing demand, is desperate to attract foreign capital. 
But after nearly a decade of liberalisation, Enron is among the few private 
power companies to begin generating power in India. ",Jim,"2.62 billion rupees

The Outlook

LOS ANGELES

Helmut Ackermann founded L.A. Dye & Print Works Inc. 18
years ago, when he took over a bankrupt dye house. Today,
thanks to California's worsening energy crisis, L.A. Dye &
Print is back on the brink of closure.

Mr. Ackermann depends on natural gas to operate the
massive boilers and heaters used to color and dry fabrics.
He expects his December gas bill to have jumped to
$600,000 from $132,000 last January. Hammered by the
soaring costs, he has already closed one plant and
dismissed 40 people. Now, he says the jobs of his
remaining 660 workers are in jeopardy. ""If it stays the
way it is, we won't be around very long,"" Mr. Ackermann
says.

Stories like this are causing economists to worry that
California's economic troubles -- the energy crisis,
combined with a high-tech shakeout and growing labor
unrest in the entertainment industry -- could put more
drag on a U.S. economy that is already downshifting.
Chart: California and the World Economy

The World's largest economies by gross national product,

US                      $8.4

The energy mess is ""one more negative added to the mix,""
says Tom Lieser, a senior economist at the University of
California at Los Angeles's Anderson Business Forecast. He
expects California to navigate its way through the
immediate crisis but worries about its longer-term impact.
Questions about the reliability and cost of the state's
power supply, for example, could threaten continued growth
of vital industries such as technology.

Some Wall Street economists worry that California's
problems could spill over and hurt the broader U.S.
economy. In a report titled ""California Unplugged -- A
Drag on Global Growth?"" Morgan Stanley Dean Witter warns
that California's energy crisis threatens to push up
production costs and make U.S. exports from the state,
which totaled $102.9 billion in 1999, less competitive on
world markets.

""Negatives tend to snowball, so what is happening in
California has the potential to exacerbate the weakness we
already are seeing in the U.S. economy,"" says Joseph
Quinlan, a Morgan Stanley economist.

Other states facing economic and financial trouble
wouldn't warrant such attention. But California not only
is the nation's largest state in terms of both population
and economic heft, but the Golden State also seemed to
epitomize the New Economy. Job growth in the state has
been double that in the nation as a whole; of the 2.1
million jobs created in the U.S. during the first 11
months of last year, one of every five new hires was in
California. The state produced more than $1.2 trillion in
output in 1999, making it the sixth-largest economy in the
world, slightly smaller than the economy of the United
Kingdom and a little bigger than that of Italy. The
state's economic output contributed about 12% of total
U.S. gross domestic product. New York, in second place,
had an 8.1% share of GDP.

But soaring energy costs are beginning to take a toll on
the Golden State, and low-end manufacturers are among the
first to see the change. ""It is forcing many of us to face
a shutdown,"" says Scott Edwards, president of the
Association of Textile Dyers, Printers and Finishers of
Southern California. His industry runs on gross profit
margins of 10% to 15%, hardly enough to handle the
fivefold increase in natural-gas costs that many operators
have witnessed.

Soaring energy prices also are hurting California's
agricultural industry. ""We can't pass along the costs of
production"" as some other industries do, says Heather
Flower, a spokeswoman for the Western Growers Association,
a group of 3,500 growers in California and Arizona. Some
are cutting back on plantings of broccoli, lettuce and
strawberries, among other crops, because of uncertainty
about costs.

Electricity prices already are on the march. The state's
largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison Co., received temporary rate increases
last week ranging from 9% for residential customers to 15%
for large companies. Some economists say the rises, if
they become permanent, could wipe out a large chunk of
per-capita-income gains and result in less consumer
spending.

On top of the energy problems, Hollywood is bracing for a
strike by the Writers Guild of America and the unions
representing film and television actors, whose contracts
are set to expire this year. The studios spent the end of
2000 jamming in production to cushion the impact of a
potential strike. The sector employs nearly 300,000 people
in the state.

While there seems little doubt that the troubles brewing
in California will prove painful, there are reasons to
believe the state can still avert an outright economic
contraction. Its economy is more diversified and resilient
than a decade ago, when national-defense cutbacks and an
overbuilt property market crippled the local economy. Back
then, jobs in the aerospace sector shrank by 70%, and
office-vacancy rates in major markets soared.

Also, despite all the attention being given to the state's
energy crisis, the fact is ""we're not a very
energy-intensive economy,"" says Ted Gibson, chief state
economist with California's department of finance. He
notes that the state ranks 48th among the 50 states in
per-capita energy consumption. And he adds that the $11
billion in deficit spending racked up by the two big
utilities amounts to less than 1% of state output. ""It's
not the kind of cost that will bring the state to its
knees,"" he says.

In the Room

Reliant submitted its proposal for blended rates and determining the real gap 
between a blended wholesale price and potential retail rates. Reliant showed 
that the gap is potentially quite small.
Reliant's effort was to move us away from the ""Sharing the Pain"" concept 
offered by PG&E.
Enron again requested utility ideas for a quid pro quo, assuming any deal 
could be struck.
Judge requested additional info from ISO and PX on market shares -- several 
marketers explained their concern (e.g. Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, 
Avista) that this request gave credence to the ""Pain"" allocation proposal and 
refused to give permission to release their data.  Enron said it was checking 
on whether to release the data, but had the same concerns as the other 
marketers on the principles.
Judge decided to use a joint statement for his report (see attached) to the 
public. The statement was agreed to, in large part, by the participants.
Judge mentioned that 40% of the A/S market is apparently held by three 
municipal/alien utilities. 
Judges order urges participation by these parties.

1310,"As most of you know, in a last ditch attempt, we are trying to develop a 
complete ""solution"" to the California problems that can be presented in the 
Sec of Treasury discussions.  It would be very helpful if people would 
comment or provide analysis on the likelihood of the following settlement 
points:  

1. Long-Term Contracting
key need of CA is NEW POWER PLANTS - KEY MESSAGE - AND IT'S IN CALIFORNIA'S 
AUTHORITY TO DELIVER
Live Auction conducted by DEALBENCH
auction should be focused on ""build"" economics
parties bid ($/Mwh) for the right to deliver 500+ MW (the right size needs to 
be determined) into Cal ISO control area for 5 years and the winning bidder 
obtains a pre-approved generation site in California (with all permits, 
siting obligations, and interconnection - BIG ISSUE) to build starting within 
2 months
focusing on just delivered energy without generation site is difficult to 
price (market too illiquid)
keep the number of auctions to a minimum (probably 6 - 10) for each utility
Counterparty is State of California (some agency)
maybe structure the bids to be 50-50 baseload vs. peaking

2. Utility Retail Ratemaking
per RELIANT ENERGY model, need $85/Mwh on average to work within retail 
framework (how much would rate increase does this create?)
goal must be to have EBITDA positive utilities, although long-term utilities 
should be EBITDA = $0 for generation sales
keep the current PX structure? 
Utilities may have to ""eat"" some of the current undercollection

3. Interim Credit Support
pro rata credit from all creditors (including banks and energy suppliers)
60 day forbearance (to allow the auction to occur)

4. Liability 
PG&E, SDG&E, and SCE agree not to sue any suppliers
State of California considers ""taking"" all civil cases and not pursuing
State of California agrees not to pursue any criminal cases

5. Other Actions
FERC agrees to immediate price cap lifting
FERC and California agree to complete non-stakeholder board for ISO
CPUC immediately finds that the result of the auction is ""reasonable""


The key point is to (1) stop the current bleeding by getting long-term deals 
in place soon and (2) manage the rate shock.  We will be working three things 
(1) structure of the long-term auction, (2) rate model showing how high 
prices of long-term auction power can be, and (3) financial results for 
utilities under this outcome.

What else needs to be included in a settlement?

1312,"High-level meetings took place between officials of the Clinto 
Administration, Governor Davis and other parties on Tuesday night (Ken Lay 
and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron). The parties agreed to continue the CA 
talks at Treasury and to suspend the FERC process.  The FERC chief judge and 
FERC staff attended the meetings at Treasury on Wednesday.  The Tuesday 
meeting is called the meeting of ""principals.""

Apparent   Process
Tuesday meeting gave two assignments to us.  
 (1)  Develop framework for auction for long-term contracts and resolving QF 
issues
 (2)  Develop framework for dealing with utility debt, including supplier 
""forbearance""

Long-term contracts--Attended by Sue Mara
 -- After much debate, divided into three subgroups:
  (a) Timeline/Implementation
  (b) Utility Needs/Product definition/RFP development
  (c) Standard Contract Development
 -- Timeline -- I was the lead and we completed our assignment.  We agreed on 
an aggressive schedule   with power flowing by 2/1/01.  The process is set up 
for DWR, working with a consultant.  It's an   RFP rather than an auction 
process. The idea of a  mock auction was rejected.
 --  Product definition -- Much work needed here.  Major issue set forth 
below.
 -- Contract -- Most parties (including Enron) want to use the EEI standard 
contract.  Group working on   additional provisions.  Plan final contract by 
Friday.
Utility Debt -- Attended by Sarah Novosel
 -- Report later

Major Issues from Long-Term Contracts

NEW MAJOR ISSUE:  Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they want the 
State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that this had 
been their idea all along.  In their view, the utilities provide a forecast 
and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of the 
utilities.  They were unwilling to commit to any time frame.
Kind of Auction or RFP -- a.k.a What does the Governor really want?  Many 
people in the room believe that the Governor was firm in his demand for 5.5 
cent power for ALL the unmet load of the utilities.  We spent four hours 
debating these issues.  In the end, the parties felt that the best approach 
would be to have simulataneous auctions as follows:
 -- Separate bids for NP 15 and SP 15
 -- RFP 1 -- Suppliers submit bids for more than one product with a blended 
price of 5.5 cents.
 -- RFP 2 -- (Considered closest to the Gov's proposal) State sets price of 
5.5 cents and suppliers compete    on term and volume.
 --RFP3 -- Suppliers provide bids for any of the utilities' product needs and 
are free to bid any price,    volume or term.
 -- All RFPs would be conducted simultaneously.  Parties agree that RFP3 is 
most likely to get the
   greatest number of bids.

1315,"Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay:

Urged us to ""stay at the table"".

Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from 
which to calculate offering prices).

QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight.
says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply).
believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased 
forward (perhaps by state entity).

Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost 
based at  4?/kwh.

If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new 
commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% 
of SCE supply).

Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this 
evening.

Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as 
high as 6.0?).

Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government 
facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution.

Thinks it's nearly a ""done deal"" that DWR (state entity) will buy power.

Says securitization may be harder to get.

Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear 
payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities 
over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the 
progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson.

California Power Crisis in a Nutshell: David Wilson (Update1)

     (Adds dollar amount of Southern California Edison's last
default and references to bond insurers, Fitch and electricity
Board; updates federal response. Commentary. David Wilson is a
columnist for Bloomberg News. Opinions expressed are his own.)

     Princeton, New Jersey, Jan. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Californians
have suffered power blackouts. The state's two largest utilities
have defaulted on debt and failed to make power payments. State
and federal officials are working on solutions. The following
guide is designed to explain what, and who, is behind it all.

                             The Issue

     California's two largest utilities must pay more for power
than they can charge under a 1996 utility-deregulation law, which
froze rates until March 2002. They have racked up more than $11.5
billion in power-related debt. Out-of-state suppliers have balked
at selling electricity and natural gas to them because of concern
that they may not get paid.
     The price of power to California utilities more than
quadrupled during 2000 amid a surge in the cost of natural gas,
which more than half the power plants in the state burn. Natural
gas rose as much as 25-fold during December.

                           The Companies

     PG&E Corp. (ticker symbol PCG): Owner of Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., California's largest utility. Its shares have lost
55 percent during the past year, and it's one of only two stocks
in the Dow Jones Utilities Average to drop during that period.
     The unit's losses on power purchases totaled $6.6 billion at
the end of last year. On Wednesday, PG&E defaulted on $43 million
of commercial paper and the utility unit defaulted on another $33
million. The unit has a $583 million power bill due on Feb. 1, and
another $2.12 billion is due by March 2.
     Edison International (EIX): Owner of Southern California
Edison Co., the state's second-largest utility. Its stock price
has fallen 67 percent in the last 12 months, making it the worst
performer among the Dow utility stocks.
     Power-buying losses at the unit totaled $4.5 billion as of
Dec. 31. The utility defaulted Tuesday on $230 million of bonds
and failed to make $366 million of payments for power. Yesterday
it defaulted on $32 million of commercial paper. Another $378
million of power payments are due this month.
     Power suppliers: Include Calpine Corp. (CPN), Duke Energy
Corp. (DUK), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Enron Corp. (ENE), Reliant Energy
Inc. (REI), Sempra Energy (SRE), the Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
unit of Southern Co. (SO) and Williams Cos. (WMB).
     Natural-gas suppliers: Include Coastal Corp. (CGP), Duke
Energy, the J. Aron & Co. unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
Sempra Energy and Western Resources Inc. (WR).

                          The Financiers

     Banks: Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) arranged a total of $4.2 billion in loans. They refused
Wednesday to let PG&E and Pacific Gas & Electric borrow part of a
$1 billion credit line, leading to the commercial-paper default.
     Ace Ltd. (ACL): Bermuda-based insurance company. A unit has
about $14 million of reinsurance on the two utilities' bonds and
about $125 million in debt assumed in credit-default swaps, which
protect bondholders against defaults. ``Ace believes that any loss
would be substantially less,'' it said in a statement.
     Bond insurers: MBIA Inc. (MBI), the largest U.S. bond
insurer, guaranteed more than $1 billion of Edison's and PG&E's
bonds. Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABK) said its exposure totals
about $150 million. Smaller amounts are at risk for Financial
Security Assurance Co. and Financial Guaranty Insurance Co.

                        The Rating Services

     Standard & Poor's: Said Dec. 13 that it might cut ``A''
ratings on the parent companies and ``A+'' ratings on the units.
Downgraded them to ``BBB-,'' its lowest investment-grade rating,
on Jan. 4. Lowered them to ``CC'' on Tuesday except for Southern
California Edison, cut to ``D'' because of its default. S&P may
also reduce ratings even more.
     Moody's Investors Service: Said Dec. 11 that it may lower
``A3'' ratings on PG&E and Edison, along with ``A2'' ratings on
their utility units. Downgraded them all to ``Baa3,'' its lowest
investment-grade rating, on Jan. 5. Lowered ratings on the parent
companies to ``Caa3'' and their units to ``Caa2'' earlier this
week. All may be cut further.
     Fitch IBCA: Said Nov. 7 that it might cut ``A'' and ``A+''
ratings on senior unsecured debt of Edison and its utility unit.
and its ``A'' rating on Pacific Gas & Electric's first mortgage
bonds. Downgraded Edison and its unit to ``A-'' on Dec. 11, to
``CCC'' on Jan. 4, and to ``CC'' on Tuesday. Cut the mortgage
bonds to ``A-'' on Dec. 11 and to ``B-'' on Jan. 4.

                           The Agencies

     California Department of Water Resources: Administers the
state's water systems. Started buying power on behalf of the two
utilities in January. Can spend as much as $400 million on power
under a bill passed yesterday.
     California Independent System Operator: Owns the system that
delivers three-quarters of the state's electricity. Imposes power
emergencies as needed.
     California Power Exchange: Buys power for utilities.
Suspended the two utilities' trading privileges after Southern
California Edison failed to make a $215 million payment and PG&E
failed to meet a new requirement that it post collateral.
     California Electricity Oversight Board: Five-member state
panel that governs both the Independent System Operator and the
Power Exchange.
     California Public Utilities Commission: Regulates utilities.
Granted rate increases averaging 10 percent to the two utilities
on Jan. 4. The increases are effective for 90 days. PG&E and
Edison wanted 26 percent and 30 percent, respectively.
     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission: U.S. agency that
oversees utilities. Issued rules Dec. 15 that freed California
utilities from a requirement to buy power through the exchange.
Has rejected proposals for caps on the power prices they pay.

                          The Background

     Power supplies are so tight that California can have an
emergency even if only a few plants go off line for repairs or
malfunction. Even ocean swells can result in production cuts, as
they can clog plants' coolant intakes with sea kelp.
     About two-thirds of California's power plants are more than
30 years old. The last major plant was built more than a decade
ago, before the state toughened its emissions standards. Demand,
especially from companies making products such as computers and
semiconductors, has grown along with the state's economy.

                          The Emergencies

     Stage One: Power reserves for hydroelectric plants fall to
within 5 percent of demand, and reserves for all other types of
plants fall to within 7 percent of demand.
     Stage Two: Power reserves from all types of plants fall to
within 5 percent of demand.
     Stage Three: Power reserves fall to within 1.5 percent of
demand. Can lead to rolling blackouts in parts of the state. The
first alert of this type happened on Dec. 7; the first blackouts
happened Wednesday.

                        The State Response

     Davis declared a state of emergency Wednesday, freeing the
Department of Water Resources to spend money in its budget and the
state's general fund to buy power on the utilities' behalf.
California's legislature then approved $400 million in outlays.
     Legislators are working on a bill, proposed by Davis, that
would let the state buy as much as $3.5 billion of power a year
under multiyear contracts and sell it to utilities at cost. The
plan sets a price of $55 a megawatt hour, below the utilities'
average selling price of $72 after the rate increase. Davis has
held talks with power generators about the length and price of
contracts; he hasn't reached any agreements yet.
     Additionally, legislators have discussed allowing Pacific Gas
& Electric and Southern California Edison to refinance the power-
purchase debt by selling bonds.

                       The Federal Response

     Energy Secretary Bill Richardson issued an order Dec. 14 that
required power suppliers to sell electricity in California. The
order was extended Jan. 11 and Wednesday, and is scheduled to
expire next Tuesday. Richardson, who leaves office tomorrow with
President Bill Clinton, signed a similar order for natural-gas
suppliers that Davis had requested.

                            The Outcome

     Very much in doubt. Duke Energy, Dynegy, Reliant Energy and
Southern Energy were prepared to force the two utilities to file
for bankruptcy before the emergency spending bill was set into
motion, Davis said.

USA: Con Ed urges FERC to fix N.Y. wholesale electric market.

01/23/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Consolidated Edison Inc. , in an effort to 
protect its more than three million electric customers, urged the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to adopt mechanisms to reduce price 
spikes. 
At the opening of a two-day FERC hearing in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 22-23, 
Con Ed said in a statement it called for changes in the way the New York 
Independent System Operator (NYISO) administers the electric wholesale 
marketplace.
The NYISO was the entity authorized by the FERC to administer the state's 
competitive wholesale electric market. 
In addition, Con Ed called on the FERC to correct market flaws that allow 
power generators to exercise market power, and penalize those generators 
shown to be gaming the market to their own advantage. 
""The NYISO must take corrective action quickly to protect consumers and to 
assure them that the markets are indeed functioning efficiently and 
competitively,"" Con Ed said in its remarks. 
Con Ed is an holding company based in New York City that provides 
energy-related products and services through two regulated utility 
subsidiaries - Con Ed of New York Inc. and Orange and Rockland Electric Co. - 
and four competitive energy and telecommunications businesses. 
Con Ed proposed a new ""circuit breaker"" mechanism to hold prices down when 
the wholesale electric market was not competitive, which could occur when 
usage was high and power supplies were extremely tight. The circuit breaker 
would help prevent unreasonable price volatility. 
""Relative to estimated costs to produce energy, the energy markets frequently 
do not produce prices that are competitive, Con Ed said in its remarks to the 
FERC. 
Moreover, Con Ed said customers should be eligible for retroactive refunds if 
a power generator abuses the system and charges more than a competitive 
price. 
""Our customers must be protected from uncompetitive energy prices this 
summer,"" Con Ed of New York Inc. President Kevin Burke said. ""There must be 
strong consumer protection tools in place when the marketplace is not truly 
competitive."" 
""More generation sources will produce additional competition in the supply of 
electricity, resulting in lower costs to consumers. But until the new plants 
get on line, customers need additional protection from uncompetitive, 
inflated prices,"" Burke added. 
Since 1997, Con Ed said it has been reducing the portion of the electric bill 
it controls - the delivery of electrical power. 
Under an agreement approved by the New York State Public Service Commission 
last year, Con Ed was providing an additional $1.5 billion of reductions in 
delivery rates, which followed $1.1 billion in rate reductions granted in the 
1997 agreement. These new reductions will be in effect at least until 2005. 
The average Con Ed residential customer will save an additional $50 in 2001. 
The average large commercial customer will save about $1,000. 
However, the cost to Con Ed of buying electricity from power generators in 
the wholesale market has risen dramatically, which has in turn driven up 
customers' total energy costs because Con Ed passes those costs onto its 
customers.

USA: U.S. Cash LPG - Market drops on softer NYMEX nat gas.

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas 
liquid (NGL) prices dropped early Tuesday, tracking weakening natural gas 
futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), players said. 
Conway, Kan. propane lost around a nickel to 78.50 cents a gallon in see-saw 
trade, while losing 3.75 cents to 76.25/77.00 cents a gallon in Mont Belvieu, 
Texas, traders said.
""The market is puking today, with gas down"" said one Midwest trader. ""Natural 
gas was the only thing propane was hanging its hat on, and now that's 
falling."" 
Midday, NYMEX natural gas futures were trading 47.70 cents lower at $6.98 per 
million British thermal units (mmBtu) amid continuing warm weather forecasts. 
Crude oil futures were down 63 cents to $29.17 a barrel on profit-taking 
ahead of the release of weekly industry stock data later in the afternoon. 
Conway isobutane, which soared to trade above $1.10 cents a gallon last week, 
subsided, dropping 12.25 cents to 86.00/89.75 cents a gallon on the day, 
players said. The sudden drops over the last two days were interpreted by 
players to mean that a few dealers were caught short last week, and dismissed 
talk of a supply shortage in the region. 
Belvieu isobutane was talked 1.75 cents weaker to be offered at 79.00 cents a 
gallon, dealers said. 
Meanwhile, ethanes also suffered heavy losses, with mix down 3.50 cents to be 
offered at 56.25 cents a gallon in Conway, and down 4.25 cents in Belvieu at 
57.75 cents a gallon. Belvieu purity lost 2.25 cents to trade at 59.75 cents 
a gallon. 
Normal butane lost a nickel in Conway to talk at 80.00/83.00 cents a gallon, 
while losing 3.25 cents to trade at 79.75 cents a gallon in Belvieu, dealers 
said. 
Natural gasoline lost a notional 1.75 cents to be offered at 82.50 cents a 
gallon for Enron barrels in Texas, while Kansas product lost 1.25 cents to 
talk at 83.00/84.50 cents a gallon, traders said.

California regulators may block sales of Nevada power plants

01/23/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

LAS VEGAS (AP) - The parent company of Nevada Power Co. says California 
regulators might stop it from selling its northern Nevada power plants. 
Sierra Pacific Resources told investors on Monday that if the deal is blocked 
it'll be harder to finance its $3.1 billion dollar acquisition of General 
Electric of Oregon from Enron Corp.
""It's more difficult if you can't sell the plants than if you can,"" said 
Steve Rigazio, Nevada Power president. 
Las Vegas-based Nevada Power and Reno-based Sierra Pacific want to sell all 
but two of their electricity generation plants. State and federal regulators 
ordered the companies to sell as a condition of their 1999 merger. 
But with power shortages, price spikes and rolling blackouts plaguing the 
West Coast, California legislators last week ordered California utilities not 
to sell power plants before January 2006. 
The new law might prevent Sierra Pacific Power from selling its power plants 
because it serves 40,000 customers in California's Lake Tahoe area. 
Nevada Power said the California law might also block its sale of the Mohave 
power station at Laughlin, Nev., for $134 million to AES Corp. 
Southern California Edison, the majority owner of Mohave, could be blocked by 
the California law. 
The Nevada utility wants to sell two groups of power plants for $545 million 
and has a third power plant on the sales block. 
Nevada's Legislature, which opens Feb. 5, might also prohibit power plant 
sales. 
The Southern Nevada Water Authority board, made up of elected city and county 
officials, last week voted to oppose Nevada power plant sales. The officials 
want to keep the plants as safeguards against high electricity prices. 
Tim Hay, chief of the attorney general's Bureau of Consumer Protection also 
said this month that the state's coal-fired power plants should not be sold. 
Hay argued that the coal plants could provide at least a minimum amount of 
low-cost electricity to Nevada homes and businesses.

I know how eagerly everyone is awaiting the formation of the Resource 
Allocation Working group*.  Below is a brief description of the group's 
purpose and initial steps we will be taking.  I want to thank everyone in 
advance for what I know will be a successful effort.

What this group is about:       Identifying best practices within Public 
Affairs for prioritization of efforts and allocation of resources and 
documenting the best practices for implementation as soon as possible 
throughout Public Affairs.

How we're going to do it:  Quickly and efficiently.

Why we're doing this:  Because we have finite human and financial 
resources.... because we have an obligation to direct those finite resources 
to their highest and best use.
  
When we're going to start this process:  Initial meeting in Houston, January 
7, 2000 from 8:00am - 11:00am (call in participation is perfectly acceptable).

What's required for initial meeting:  A one page or less description of how 
your group prioritizes its efforts; how both human and financial resources 
are allocated, and how all of this fits within your budgeting process (should 
be distributed to all group members two (2) days prior to meeting).

Finally:  I am attaching material that my group has used over the last year 
to implement a resource allocation/issue priortization process.  I will 
provide a more detailed explanation at the initial meeting.  Please feel free 
to call me if you have any questions before then.

*  You've either been nominated or selected, or volunteered for this working 
group.  Congratulations.

Upon further reflection after the recent staff meeting, I have made the 
determination that any and allengagements of outside resources, e.g., outside 
counsel & consultants, public relations firms, etc... must be approved 
through the Resource Commitment Review (RCR) process.  Accordingly, the $2500 
trigger that had been in place is no longer.  To ensure that the process 
works in a more timely manner, I am creating weekly RCR meetings (Harry, Jim 
& myself) at which all pending RCR's will be acted on.  I will deal with 
emergency RCR's as they may arise between the weekly meetings.

Bottom line, the RCR process is of enormous value to the group as it helps to 
document that we are properly focusing the company's resources in the places 
where it is of most value.  I firmly believe that whatever minor 
inconveniences this change will entail, they are minor in relationship to 
ensuring the success and credibility of the RCR process.

involved in Welsh development issues, to discuss our power project at Rassau 
in Wales, and found him very supportive of the UK government's stricter 
consents policy regarding gas-fired power generation, and not at all 
favourably disposed to projects of the size being proposed for Rassau, i.e., 
1200 MW (he asked why we could not make it much smaller).  Helen Liddell was

1351,"Assembly Committee held a hearing on ABX1-18  Hertzberg, the speaker's 
vehicle for allowing DWR to purchase power for the state and to use revenue 
bonds to payoff utility undercollections and to finance ongoing DWR operating 
costs.  We have forwarded by fax the latest version of this bill.    The 
Assembly Committee was only able to discuss three sections of the bill before 
adjourning until 1 pm tomorrow.  Chairman Wright expects to take the 
remainder of the afternoon tomorrow to go through the bill line by line and 
expects to only get part way.  He anticipates no hearings over the weekend 
and more hearings to follow Monday through Wednesday next week.  Thus no vote 
on the bill is expected for a while. In addition, all parties, including 
Wright expect amendments as a result of ongoing negotiations between the 
Governor, Speaker, the utilities and the generators.  These would center on 
the price the generators will bid and how much if anything the utilities will 
have to absorb of past undercollections.  There is no indication at the 
present of when they will show or what those amendments will say.

Initial analysis of the bill raises the following issues:

Most important issue   On pages 3 - 8 of the bill, new provisions are added 
to AB 1890 (Section 368 et al) to define how the TRA and TCBA are to be 
calculated and what the Commission must allow in rates.  These provisions 
appear unduly generous to the utilities and may well provoke an immediate end 
to the rate freeze if enacted.  Here are the main elements of the language.

368.2  The Legislature finds that it is appropriate to allow the utility to 
recover the reasonable costs incurred to purchase wholesale energy.  (that 
means the big under collection from summer 2000 to date)

368.3  New definitions of the ""adjusted TCBA"" and ""net undercollected 
amounts"" are provided which appear to provide for the following way of 
wrapping up transition cost ratemaking.

1.  The TCBA is the positive balance as of 12-31-00 increased by the trust 
transfer amounts to be recovered in rates for 2001, also increased by amounts 
included in retail rates for prior period costs (if any are authorized by the 
CPUC), and also increased by the balances in the generation memo accounts as 
of 12-31-00.  
2.  The new ""net  uncollected amount"" that the utilities could collect in 
rates would be the current TRA account, as reduced by the above defined 
balance in the TCBA as of 12-31-00.  

NOTE: Edison claims this is the same mechanism that Enron proposed to the 
Commission as an alternate to the TURN proposal.  It has similarities to the 
comments we filed Nov. 9, but our official position is still to support the 
from-the-begining netting of the two accounts as proposed by TURN.

3.  There is also language to lock in the CPUCs current ratemaking for these 
accounts so that the TURN proposal to net the TRA and TCBA cannot be 
implemented.

4.  The utilities'retained generation will be put in rate base at book value, 
except for the nukes, which will have their rate base calculated WITHOUT the 
application of overcollections in the transition cost balancing account to 
accelerate depreciation.

5.  The CPUC is supposed to establish a dedicated rate component within the 
existing rates as of 1-8-01 to allow recovery of the net undercollection (the 
large TRA undercollection as reduced per the above).  The undercollection is 
to be amortized over 10 years.

6.  The utilities will not have to buy power if their credit rating drops 
below BBB+.

The remainder of the bill has to do with the mechanism for the DWR to 
purchase power and to have revenue reduction bonds pay for costs in excess of 
those recovered in the utilities rates.  Rod Wright is seeking a ""stop 
loss""provision which will force a rate increase once the DWR has used up all 
its appropriation and all the bond revenues to buy power.  This is 
controversial with the other members.

We have been asked for a reaction by the committee members and would like a 
response ASAP, certainly by mid-day Friday.  This will require balancing the 
concerns about and early end to the rate freeze with the increased likelihood 
of payment for power transactions once DWR is funded.  The prospect of 
successful participation in more auctions is unclear unless more practical 
auction terms are used.  However, the auction process is not spelled out in 
this bill. The generators are supporting an early end to the freeze so that 
they can be paid...I  am in meetings starting early in the am so I will not 
be on the 10:30 call, please send comments to scott govenor..either by e mail 
or by fax, his fax is 9164480816.  I am also interested in how we should

___________________________________________________________________________
Dear Friends: Please review, correct, make additions and return. Joe


The Energy Services Coalition (please note that we are no longer using
US
WTO ESC) met at the request of Carol Balassa of USTR to get her
perspective
on energy services negotiations of the WTO and what our coalition needs
to
accomplish as well as a time perspective.

Present from the USG were Carol Balassa (USTR), Josephine Ludolph and
Richard Boll (DOC), Russ Profozich (DOE), Patricia Norman (DOS) and a
regular from the ITC.

Joe Hillings, Christina Bolton, Bob Fisher, Steve Burns, Brian Petty and
Chris Long represented the ESC.

Carol conducted an extensive and excellent briefing listing several
phases
of activity. She started the session by telling those present that the
lack
of action at Seattle was not a negative on what we need to accomplish
this
coming year. We are on track and need to produce various position papers
as
early as the end of January.

Articles 19 of the GATT requires that the WTO make progress on
agriculture
and services issues although it does not identify a date certain to
achieve
agreement..

Ambassador Barshefsky is committed to beginning services negotiations
beginning in January.

A Committee on Specific Committments is charged with the responsibility
to
draft issues. The USTR wants to have a definition of issues from the ESC
by
the end of January to be submitted to the USG representatives on the
Committee.

A second significant group in the process is the Working Group On
Domestic
Rights.This group is chaired by Peter Collins. Peter needs to know what
are
the domestic regulatory issues that could be raised by other WTO members
as
reasons not to liberalize various sectors. This information is to be
supplied in the first half of 2000.

In late spring after group one and two have done a significant part of
their work the USTR will be deciding what additional principles are
needed
to be tabled in the negotiation. They expect these working groups will
begin to meet at the WTO by the end of next summer.

Three basic columns headed by (1) Market Access, (2) National Treatment,
(3) Additional Committments (Could be proposed annex such as the process
Tim Richards has proposed in our Electricity Working Group listing
examples) is the format to be developed for the two groups.

Carol advised us that whatever we develop should be with the intention
of
getting Less Developed Countries (LDCs) supporting our basic principles
in
case a multilateral negotiation is not launched. We should work the
current
liberalization process being prosecuted in the APEC and FTAA
negotiations..

The next phase of Carol's presentation addressed the recent response
USTR
received to the questions they submitted to DG 17 (it no longer exisits
under the new commission) asking the EU to address their feelings about
the
liberalization of energy services.

We have not been given a copy of the EU response and Carol has asked Ms.
Klinkers of the EU if the response can be shared with the ESC to secure
industry responce. Carol and others from the USG attending the meeting
are
trying to ascertain just who drafted the responses which they
characterized
as ""confusing and not indicating a real understanding of the current
practices and developments in the energy services sector.""  We do know
that
the USG has called this office to ask how they need to respond to the EU
response that electricity is a good and not a service. Our immediate
response is that this is a matter of some disagreement among EU members
and
the EU staff. The movement of electricity across national boundries may
be
a good but the sale and trading of electricity is definately a service.

The EU response we were told makes the agrument that in their view that
many of the items raised in the October paper of the USTR were GAT
covered
such as construction, engineering, etc and therefore, may not need to be
raised in the services negotiations although these items will at least
need
some sort of annex to make sure they are included.. The EU believes that
if
you own or operate electricity producting  then its a good but if you
operate an IPP to sell electricity to various parties, its a service.

We were told that the EU response does not seem to understand or cover
renewables such as wind and solar both of which are important in
Europe's
plan to diversify and develop green energy.  They also believe that
price/risk management should be considered under finance services not
energy services.


The session was then open to general discussion. Bob Fisher commented
that
the EU does not seem to understand the scope of today's energy services
industry. That we now have a seemless web of energy services that has
been
developed. What about environmental services? Again, the EU response is
confusted and incomplete. Apparently they feel that environmental
services
can be considered elsewhere in the negotiation.

Who from the EU drafted this paper? The staff has changed and we don't
know
how ""high"" in their heirarchy this was considered. Carol Balassa
responded
that she is trying to determine who drafted the response..  Brian Petty
advised that his intelligence is that energy services is being discussed
and considered at the highest levels of the Commission.


Carol told us that she is trying to get everything together before
""talking"" to the EU in January when she hopes to specifically respond
and
discuss their current returned response. Therefore, she is asking the
Energy Services Coalition to complete the work of our four Working
Groups
which will allow the Hills people to develop the definition and basic
negotiating position papers.

The DOS representative then suggested that we engage in some""capacity
building."" This was defined as an outreach program to brief WTO member
delegations on the meaning of energy services. Carol suggested that
after
her January meeting the EU could be agreeable to having our industry
group
meet with their representatives to explain how energy services has
evolved
and what is included in energy services.


We moved to a discussion of the definitions paper itself. Bob Fisher
reminded those present that the current matrix developed for the APEC
process was still an excellent guide to definitions although items such
as
renewables, heating and certain trading and financial services would
need
to be added. To meet some EU concerns that they are not a party to APEC
and
therefore suspicious of any such document, we should remove the
reference
to APEC.

Our group pointed to the Tim Richards paper developed for our
Electricity
Working Group which gives a broad definition but then contains a
footnote
known as the illustrative list which lists the various items that we
believe constitute energy services under that heading. Bob Fisher said
that
this was the likely format we would ultimately adopt in the material
prepared for USTR and others in the WTO process.  Bob said that once
negotiators agree on the need for liberalized energy services they can
""fit"" whatever they want under the broad definition.

The last question raised was what happens to the ATL (accelerated tariff
liberalization) which also covers some energy matters which WTO
countries
had contemplated being approved in Seattle. Carol said that she did not
know.

The meeting then adjourned.


The ESC needs to complete the Working Group process and complete the
questionaire at the earliest possible time to allow the Hills people to
prepare the basic document. Working Group chairs are to be asked to
complete this process by mid January.


Dear Reviewers: Please review at your earliest opportunity, make
corrections, additions and whatever and return to me for distribution.
Distribution will be to our ESC Executive Committee first and then to
our
entire membership of 45 (not to those who have not signed on as members)
and to USG participants.

1354,"Here are possible Q's.  Dan W. will prepare first cut at answers.  

Questions for January 31 Hearing

Price Gouging
?   On January 22, your company reported fourth-quarter results for
2000, in which you showed that profits from your energy trading unit rose
256 percent and your overall earnings rose 34 percent.  How much of this was
attributable to increased sales in California?  How much did you make from
sales in California?
?   What is the highest per kilowatt-hour price Enron charged on the
spot market?  What is the cost of production for that power?
?   In a recent Houston Chronicle article (January 23, 2001), Mr.
Skilling, your CEO was quoted as saying that not only had the California
situation not had an impact on earnings, but that ""it may even turn out to
be a benefit in the long run.""  Can you please explain the long-term
benefits you expect?
?   In a recent New York Times column by Paul Krugman, Ken Lay was
quoted as saying that California consumers ""need to see the price signals
that is, pay much more and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until
we get more supplies.""  What did Mr. Lay mean by this?  With the tremendous
profits that Enron is making in this situation, isn't it pretty brazen for
him to be suggesting that California consumers should pay more for their
power?

Market Manipulation
?   A number of generators and wholesalers, including Enron, have been
accused of withholding energy to drive up energy prices in the Western
states.  I understand that you are being sued in state court in San
Francisco for such activities and an independent monitor has supported these
allegations.  Does Enron currently have any generation assets off-line for
maintenance?  Did Enron make all of its generated power in the Western
states available for purchase by California utilities?  If not, why did it
withhold power?  How much did you withhold or sell in other states despite
knowing of the crisis in California?
?   At the time that the spot market collapsed and two of California's
largest utilities were teetering on the verge of bankruptcy, what price was
Enron asking for its power on the spot market?  What was Enron's cost of
producing that power?  How much profit did you make in December from sales
in California?
?   Did Enron ever refuse to sell power to a California utility because
of concerns about their credit worthiness?  Did your company ever tell
California utilities that it would not sell power to them because of credit
concerns?
?   Do you believe that Enron has any responsibility as a corporation in
a crisis such as occurred in California?  How do you justify making such
large profits, driving the utilities into bankruptcy and then refusing to
sell power to those same utilities because of their credit worthiness?  

Utility Forbearance & Auction
?   California clearly has a significant problem with the potential
bankruptcy of two of its largest utilities.  How much money do those
utilities owe your company?  Has your company offered any payment
forbearance or forgiveness in light of the excessive prices that you were
charging them on the spot market for power?
?   California held an Internet auction last week for long-term
contracts for sale of power to the state.  Did Enron participate in the
auction?  What price did you offer for power in non-peak times?  What price
did you bid for power during peaking periods?
?   Your company has successfully gouged the utilities in California for
power on the spot market because long-term contracts were discouraged.  Now,
you are looking to enter into long-term contracts, which many experts
believe will be at rates far above the market in the future.  You really are
going to profit coming and going.  How can you claim that you are not price
gouging in this case?
?   In the past, you have offered power to California utilities in
long-term contracts at rates less than $.06 per kilowatt-hour.  How do you
justify previously offering power at much lower rates and now saying that
you are unable to provide it for less than a much higher price?

Role in California Deregulation
?   Your company was supportive of the California deregulation efforts
and has been a leading supporter of deregulation nationwide.  In light of
the ""colossal failure"" of the effort in California, do you still support
deregulation in other states or at the federal level?  What safeguards would
you support to protect against increased rates for consumers?

The Future
?   California is likely to enact a legislative fix to address this
problem.  What do you think will happen this summer during peak demand
periods?  Is there another crisis in the making in California or in other
states such as New York?

Political Contributions & Activities
?   Your company has been very active politically and according to press
reports, Mr. Lay is very close to President Bush.  Wasn't your company one
of the biggest donors to the Bush Campaign and the Inaugural Committee?  How
much money did your company contribute in soft money to the Bush Campaign
and the RNC?  How much money did your executives give in personal money to
the Bush Campaign and the RNC?  How much to the inaugural?
?   Has anyone from Enron participated in the Bush transition teams or
the so-called ""advisory committees?""  
?   What information and suggestions has your company or its officials
provided to the transition team or the new Administration regarding energy
deregulation or the California situation?
?   What discussions have officials from your company had with
Administration or Transition officials about the California situation?

 
Softball Questions

?   In the short term and then in the long term, what can California do
to fix its power supply system?
?   What do you believe are the flaws in the current California system?
The Power Exchange?  The Independent System Operator?
?   Why did deregulation fail in California?
?   Some people, including Governor Davis, have suggested that
out-of-state power suppliers, such as Enron, are to blame for this crisis,
is that true?
?   Some people in California have suggested that the State should take
over the power system.  Please comment on this proposal.  Is this a good
idea?
?   In which states has deregulation worked?  How do you explain the
success in those states in contrast with the failures in California?
?   This Committee will likely consider deregulation legislation at some
point in the future.  Should we undertake this effort?",Dan W. Skilling Paul Krugman Ken Lay Lay Bush Davis,less than $.06,Enron Houston Chronicle New York Times the Inaugural Committee RNC The Power Exchange The Independent System Operator State

Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.  As a result of the Triggering 
Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the 
MOPA.  At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to 
terminate the MOPA.  Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this 
point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of 
the MOPA. 

 The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be 
willing to continue performing under the MOPA.  This proposal is conditioned 
on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA 
paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the 
MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings.

will invoke the Government of India Guarantee tomorrow (late night tonight 
our time).  Ken Lay was on the India call today and confirmed support for 
this approach, absent new developments.  The India team feels strongly, and 
we agree, that we should clearly set the explanation of this action by 
issuing a press release.  The press release would be issued by DPC for 
distribution in India only.  However, the story and the release are almost 
certain to be picked up by the international wires.

Attached for your approval is the proposed DPC release.  It is deliberately 
not worded in Enron fashion.  We believe there is a strong possibility that 
many Indian publications will take this release almost verbatim.  Since it is 
lengthy and explains the issue, we also believe many publications will 
necessarily reduce the amount of space normally dedicated to opposing 
commentary.   Of course, we will be armed with appropriate Q&As for use with 
international media.  Please let me know whether or not you have any concerns 
with this approach (713-646-6423 or cellular 281-948-7273).

Thanks for this analysis. I think we would all agree that the solution to
put power
100% in the hand of the state is an extremely frightening proposition.
Unfortunately, it
falls in-line with what Gov. Davis likes to do, which is to control all of
the process himself.

thousands of these -- each like an individual contract.  If the state tried

What We're Reading[IMAGE]  War Letters : Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars 
by Andrew Carroll (Editor), Douglas Brinkley (Introduction)
 From a treasure trove of over 50,000 submissions, Andrew Carroll selected 150 letters, spanning 130 years of warfare from the Civil War to Bosnia, to create this remarkable collection. Most were written by uncelebrated but dearly loved soldiers from barracks, trenches, and flooded foxholes, as well as combat journalists, nurses, and family members on the home front. His rich sample testifies to the universal and poignant themes of love and honor, courage and rage, duty and fear and mortality. A major contribution to the understanding of war and its impact, and a powerful tribute to those undone by it. 
  Our Price: $22.40  You Save: $5.60  (20%)     [IMAGE]  Ghost Soldiers: The Forgotten Epic Story of World War II's Most Dramatic Mission 
by Hampton Sides
 In January 1945, 121 Army Rangers slipped behind enemy lines in the Philippines to liberate 513 comrades--the last survivors of the Bataan Death March--being held in a concentration camp. In Ghost Soldiers, journalist Hampton Sides recounts both the hellish imprisonment as well as that daring rescue. Thrilling from start to finish, his book celebrates the heroism of hundreds of warriors, and brings renewed attention to one of the Rangers' finest hours.

by Michael Wood
 Following in the footsteps of the greatest Spanish adventurers, Michael Wood retraces the path of the conquistadors from Amazonia to Lake Titicaca, and from the deserts of North Mexico to the heights of Machu Picchu. Few stories in history match these conquests for sheer drama, endurance, and distances covered, and Wood's gripping narrative brings them fully to life. The stories in Conquistadors are not only of conquest, heroism, and greed, but of changes in the way we see the world, history and civilization, justice and human rights. --From the publisher

 A pioneering oral historian, Patrick O'Donnell used his Web site, The Drop Zone, to solicit personal histories from individual soldiers willing to share their experiences. The result, Beyond Valor, is a moving and often brutal firsthand look at World War II from the perspective of Rangers and Airborne veterans. In an  interview with Amazon.com , O'Donnell explains the ""hidden war"" behind the official histories and why it's vital that such stories be told before they are lost forever.

History Bestsellers[IMAGE]  Close to Shore : A True Story of Terror in an Age of Innocence 
by Michael Capuzzo, Mike Capuzzo
 Michael Capuzzo tells the harrowing story of the real-life Jaws that helped inspire Peter Benchley's classic novel (and movie). Modern science now tells us that shark attacks are exceedingly rare and limited to just a few species. Yet they do occur, and one of the most terrifying episodes of fatal attacks occurred near the New Jersey shore in 1916, when a renegade great white shark went on a man-eating spree that left three adults and one boy dead. Good summer reading--but don't take it to the beach. 
  Our Price: $19.96  You Save: $4.99  (20%)     [IMAGE]  Wine and War : The French, the Nazis, and the Battle for France's Greatest Treasure 
by Don Kladstrup, et al
 It's a well-known fact that Adolf Hitler did not like wine. Still, the Germans showed no distaste for French wine when they invaded France in 1940. Indeed, among the first acts of the occupying army was to seize great stores of wine, sending tens of thousands of barrels to the Third Reich and ordering the conversion of thousands of hectares of vineyards into war production. Wine and War recounts a fascinating and little-known subplot of World War II. 
  Our Price: $19.20  You Save: $4.80  (20%)     [IMAGE]  An Album of Memories: Personal Histories from the Greatest Generation

Simply overflowing with nostalgia, these are firsthand stories from those who fought bravely in Europe or the Pacific, as well as those who maintained the home front.

1414,"Sanjeev,

We have to seriously rethink these sigma factors.  Since our system only has a product specific sigma, if we try to calculate a 90 day sigma factor we will see significant results which will not represent reality.  For example, if you take the 1 day sigma factor for West Power (18.97) over a 90 day period you will get results that are unreasonable for any short position.  If we sell power at $40 and the 90 day sigma factor is $175, you will get unreasonable results.  We need to think how we can build this given the limitations in the current EOL system.  For test tomorrow, I have recommended we use the existing 1 day sigma factors.  Let me know when you want to discuss.

1433,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	State Budget Discussions Deteriorating -Bonds Issuance Jeopardized
?	PG&E Bankruptcy Advisor Comments on SoCal

Budget & Bond Concerns
Sources report that discussions within the state's budget conference committee have completely disintegrated.  Although last Tuesday's tentative $2.7B reserve agreement between the parties offered some hope to  the situation, Republicans have since completely broken with Democrats and are begging for a number nearly half of the previously agreed amount.  The legislative recess is scheduled to begin July 20th, and prior to the Davis administration, the legislature very rarely took month-long recesses due to the budget battle (there usually was a Democrat-controlled legislature and a Republican governor).  Sources report that if legislators take leave without a budget resolution, it would most likely compromise their ability to pass the budget and MOU, before the MOU's deadline of Aug. 15th.

Sources also indicate that delays in establishing the state's budget could prompt Wall Street investors to once again downgrade California credit rating.  A lowered rating could complicate the $12B bond issuance the state expects to offer in late September 2001 by forcing the state to offer a higher rate of return, which could mean fewer bonds.  Sources recently conducted a private interview with parties close to David Wiggs, head of the LA Department of Water & Power, (DWP is in constant contact with both SoCal and PG&E and is a creditor of both utilities and the DWR. -- Wiggs is close to and in constant contact with Governor Davis, Hertzberg and Burton, and he knows every other state official relevant to energy issues).  Wiggs' position on the bonds and SoCal follows:
?	The state is ""really worried"" about the bond issuance.  The state believes it can sell $3B in bonds now, but as for $11 - $12B, they are ""not confident.""  The state is currently trying to put its revenue streams in place, then it will have to prep Wall Street regarding the revenue streams. 
?	Wiggs saw Treasurer Angelides Wednesday (6/20) and told him that, ""I wouldn't buy these bonds.""  Wiggs stated that, ""There is not a clear enough path for those rates.""  
?	Wiggs was Hertzberg's advisor on energy.  He was also at El Paso (energy company, not gas company) during its bankruptcy.  Wiggs commented that he is worried because he lives in SoCal territory rather than DWR territory.
?	Both Wiggs and his DWR staff believe that an MOU/Plan B deal will not pass.  They are not thinking in terms of counting votes, but rather of the very large number of things that need to be done simultaneously in order to make a solution work.  

PGE Advisor on SoCal
Sources recently interview the attorney who is currently acting as bankruptcy advisor to PG&E, and may be the potential advisor to SoCal in bankruptcy proceedings.  Comment follow:
?	The attorney believes that the likelihood of a SoCal voluntary filing is 60 to 70%, but he does not know when it will happen.  The attorney would not speculate as to the likelihood of an involuntary filing, stating that he did not know. 
?	Concern was expressed that if a solution were passed to make SoCal liquid again, DWR (under instructions from the state) would then refuse to purchase the net short, leaving SoCal with a huge bill for power that it could not pay.  SoCal would then be faced with borrowing money to pay for the bill (an unlikely event, given their current status) or declaring bankruptcy.  The attorney commented that DWR had already tried to send power bills to PG&E in bankruptcy; Montali refused to force PG&E to pay them.  The attorney therefore believes that DWR is likely to force SoCal (and PG&E if it were made solvent) to resume paying for power as soon as possible.  The attorney believes that SoCal is aware of this problem and that it must be taken into account as part of a bailout solution.",Davis David Wiggs Hertzberg Burton Angelides Montali,2.7B $12B bond 3B $11 - $,"PG&E SoCal

Enron Bonds Subject To Market Jitters, Not Buyout Talk
By Michael C. Barr
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/05/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Reports over the weekend that embattled Enron Corp. (ENE) might be the object of a takeover bid failed to move the company's bonds Monday. 
On Sunday, the Independent in London reported that Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. (RD) planned to mount an $11 billion offering for the company. And Barron's stated that there was speculation that Enron might attract takeover interest from either Royal Dutch or Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRKA).
Enron's bonds are quoted in dollar prices and not in terms of a spread in relation to Treasury bond issues. 
A $74 bid and a $77 offer was quoted as the market for Enron's 7-7/8% bonds of 2003 Monday morning, similar to Friday's levels. 
""The company's bonds were quoted in the low- to mid-70s on Friday and the rumors have not shown up in that pricing,"" said Wayne Schmidt, portfolio manager, Advantus Capital Management, St. Paul, Minn. 
""Market perception and not takeover rumors impact the pricing of the bonds,"" said Eric Bergson, portfolio manager, Northern Trust Global Investments, Chicago. 
Even an Enron bond with a very short time to maturity is not trading at par, traders said. 
The 6.45% coupon bond due on November 15, 2001, less than two weeks away, was bid at a dollar price of 99. 
""Some investors don't want to own anything with a downside risk,"" said Harold Rivkin, principal, H. Rivkin & Co., a distressed debt brokerage firm, Princeton, N.J. The bonds could lose a lot of value in that time frame, with little upside potential gain, he added. 
There is ""very little liquidity in the company's bonds,"" said Rivkin. Enron's bonds will follow the company's stock movements, he added. Enron closed Monday at $11.03, down $0.27 from Friday's close of $11.30. 
Enron officials weren't immediately available to comment. 
Crisis Of Investor Confidence 

The Houston-based energy services company has faced a crisis of investor confidence since it reported a $618 million third quarter loss and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last month. 
And last Wednesday, the company said that the Securities and Exchange Commission had elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into Enron's financial dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
The ratings agencies have reacted to the company's liquidity problems brought about by the loss in investor confidence. Fitch downgraded Enron's senior unsecured debt Monday to triple-B-minus, from triple-B-plus. It's now just a notch away from junk bond status. 
Last week, Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered the credit rating to triple-B, while Moody's Investors Service lowered the rating to Baa2. 
Shell May Have Interest, But 

Royal Dutch Shell may have an interest in Enron, say analysts. 
""Shell has a very sophisticated trading operations and has been looking to expand in North America and Latin America,"" said Tina Vital, equity analyst, Standard & Poor's. 
Enron is known for its trading prowess. 
And Enron could also be attractive if it could be bought cheaply, since ""Shell has a history of not overpaying for its acquisitions,"" Vital said. 
But, ""no one is going to buy the company unless it squares up its equity issues,"" she added. 
The company is not perceived by the markets as having been forthcoming in its financial reporting, analysts said.

CPUC Delays QF Payment Vote 
Sources believe that the delay in the PUC vote on paying the QFs 15% of  their undercollected debt is likely a result from both a concern about bankruptcy issues raised by issuing what could be seen as a ""preference payment"" to the QFs (the PUC does follow these issues out of necessity, given the current environment) and a lack of clarity regarding how to implement the 15% payment.  The delay was unsurprising and characteristic of how the PUC operates.  It is also noted that there are many claims on SoCal's and PG&E's cash flows currently.  Additionally, agreeing to pay 15% of debts to the QFs raises legal issues, in that the utilities would be paying debts to some creditors, but not others.  This could increase the likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against SoCal by the non-QF creditors.",,,PUC SoCal PG&E

about their opinions on Chief Kroeker.  About an hour ago, I held a news
conference to release the statement below in response.  I wanted to make
sure you were able to read it in its entirety.

You are a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my
administration.  To be removed from the ""e-Katz"" distribution list, simply
reply to this e-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail

Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker

""I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have
reviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me
feedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.

""The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests
with me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the
taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no
way reflect my own personal beliefs.

""My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and
transcripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this
issue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious
views from his professional conduct?

""I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue
to do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau
in a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law
enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I
have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong
support to continue.

""The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal
religious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status
if their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability
to perform their professional responsibilities.

""Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he
is ""out of step with Portland"" could be used in other Oregon communities to
fire more liberal public officials who are ""out of step"" with their
community's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both
ways.

""Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He
assures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo
the damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than
just walk away.

""He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who
are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.
He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.

""He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of
all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.

""He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson
to educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a ""gay disease.""

""He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual
Minority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.

""He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.

""In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will
work to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our
sense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's
personal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and
to deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.

""As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me.""

I am not sure if you are aware of the recent statements by the Prime
Minister of Canada, on his recent political trip to Whitehorse, Yukon.  He
made some erroneous statements regarding Canada's position on the ANGTS
project and Canada's requirements for any project.

The attached Official Background brief was issued by the PMO (Prime
Minister's Office) in Ottawa.  As you can see from the brief, Canada does
not agree that Foothills or the ANGTS project has exclusivity on a project
for delivering gas from Alaska.  Furthermore, Canada will ensure that any
project in the north will give maximum economic benefit to northerners.

I hope you find the attached document informative.  If you have any further
questions, please feel free to give me a call at your convenience.

GE's Jeffrey R. Immelt=20
His Focus On The Customer Boosted Him To The Top=20
By Patrick Seitz
Investor's Business Daily
Jeffrey R. Immelt, the man chosen to succeed the legendary Jack Welch as=20
chief executive of General Electric Co., knows there's just one person=20
keeping him in business: the customer. And that customer is the person Imme=
lt=20
goes all-out to please.
Immelt, 44, was plucked from the company's fast-growing GE Medical Systems=
=20
business, where he had served as president and chief executive since 1997.=
=20
The $7 billion unit, based in Waukesha, Wis., is a world leader in medical=
=20
diagnostic technology and information systems.
Immelt attributes much of his success to his laserlike focus on sales.
""I love working with customers. . . . Sales has really influenced everythin=
g=20
I do. It has instilled in me the important traits of operating with a sense=
=20
of urgency and listening to people,"" Immelt said.
Immelt on Monday was named president and chairman-elect of GE. He will=20
succeed John F. ""Jack"" Welch Jr., GE's chairman and CEO, when Welch retires=
=20
at the end of 2001.
When Immelt landed at GE Medical Systems in 1997, he quickly showed a knack=
=20
for squeezing growth from a unit known for sluggish sales. Last year, its=
=20
revenue jumped 23% to $6 billion.
Customers credit Immelt with going way beyond sales. When Chicago's=20
Northwestern Memorial Hospital expanded its scanning services last year,=20
Immelt spent hours helping to manage its work flow.
""That's the kind of collaboration that we find unusual,"" Northwestern=20
Memorial CEO Gary Mecklenburg told Business Week.
Immelt has proven himself both by turning around troubled GE divisions and=
=20
extracting better performance from thriving units.
Immelt knows how important it is to set the pace, not follow it. To keep GE=
=20
Medical flourishing, he's pushed the unit to expand acquisitions and new=20
product offerings. The division's product line ranges from ultrasound devic=
es=20
used in doctors' offices to multimillion-dollar CT and MRI scanners.
In his earlier work in GE's Plastics division, Immelt stood out by persuadi=
ng=20
hard-boiled carmakers to substitute plastics for metal on some parts.
As vice president of consumer service for GE's Appliances division, Immelt=
=20
deftly handled the fallout from a recall of refrigerator compressors. To ke=
ep=20
workers' morale pumped up during the recall, Immelt would often climb up on=
 a=20
forklift in GE's Louisville, Ky., plant and pass out words of encouragement=
=20
and praise. He took time to speak with employees during such sessions,=20
listening carefully to their ideas and concerns.
Immelt believes that open, fast communication with workers is crucial. Not =
a=20
table-thumper, he meets with employees =01) sometimes hundreds at a time =
=01) to=20
discuss where GE Medical is going. Colleagues say he works at=20
consensus-building, urging others to understand different points of view.
After returning from corporate meetings, Immelt distills the latest GE=20
thinking on videotape, and copies are sent to offices around the world.
Understanding that seeing someone face to face helps foster stronger=20
relationships, Immelt also travels often to meet employees and customers.=
=20
Constant contact keeps a company united, Immelt believes. So he updates the=
=20
company's employees once a week via e-mail on the latest developments =01) =
new=20
business, lost sales opportunities and other nuggets about company=20
initiatives. E-mail is sent in five languages, and at times up to a dozen,=
=20
according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
Immelt was one of three GE executives who analysts considered possible=20
successors to Welch. Welch, 65, has been at the helm of the Fairfield,=20
Conn.-based finance, industrial and broadcasting powerhouse for the past tw=
o=20
decades.=20
""Jeff Immelt is a natural leader, and ideally suited to lead GE for many=20
years,"" Welch said. ""He brings a keen strategic intellect, a cutting-edge=
=20
technological background, strong leadership characteristics and a unique se=
t=20
of team-building skills.""
Knowing that preparation is key to long-term success, Immelt has long been=
=20
preparing himself, says Charles M. Lillis, a former GE executive who hired=
=20
Immelt in 1982.
""Starting in high school, (in) everything he did he was a leader,"" Lillis=
=20
told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""He played football. He was a student=
=20
leader. He went to Procter & Gamble after college and he did a great job in=
=20
sales. He also had the right balance of self-confidence and awareness that =
he=20
did not know everything.""
Immelt has strong marketing skills and helped create the GE slogan, ""We bri=
ng=20
good things to life,"" in his first job at GE.
Analysts and friends say the 6-foot, 4-inch Immelt possesses not only a=20
commanding physical presence but also the intellectual strength necessary t=
o=20
inspire management and workers at GE. Immelt believes that a consistent=20
approach will give the biggest pay off.=20
He's been with GE practically all of his working life, just as his father,=
=20
Joseph, before him. His father spent his 38-year career at GE working in th=
e=20
Aircraft Engine division in Cincinnati.
Immelt has a good sense of humor and the ability to present himself well to=
=20
both Wall Street and the average worker, much like Welch.
Immelt realizes that humor helps ease conversation, forge bonds and motivat=
e=20
people. He saw that as an offensive tackle for Dartmouth College's football=
=20
team in the 1970s.=20
Immelt wanted to keep football practice fun to keep his fellow players fire=
d=20
up. Immelt came up with gags, including a tongue-in-cheek award for the coa=
ch=20
of the week. He liked to loosen up the team with jokes on the sidelines and=
=20
in the huddle, according to teammates.
Despite the fun and games, his teammates could see Immelt's drive. ""When th=
e=20
rest of us were feeling our way through college, he took it to the next=20
level,"" former teammate Curt P. Oberg told Business Week.
Immelt studied just as hard as he played. He graduated cum laude with his=
=20
B.S. degree in applied mathematics from Dartmouth and an MBA from Harvard=
=20
University.
He joined GE in 1982 after a short stint with Procter & Gamble Co. as a bra=
nd=20
manager. His first job with GE was in corporate marketing. That was followe=
d=20
by sales, marketing and management positions in the company's plastics and=
=20
appliances divisions.
When Immelt took over at GE Medical Systems in 1997, one of his first actio=
ns=20
was to oversee an internal management shake-up.
""He is an extremely capable executive leader, as evidenced by his record as=
=20
CEO of GE Medical Systems,"" analyst Martin Sankey, vice president of Goldma=
n,=20
Sachs & Co. in New York told The Associated Press. ""He compiled a strong=20
record of generating growth and moving into new markets.""
GE Medical Systems has seen profit rise as demand for big-ticket medical=20
imaging and patient-monitoring gear has grown.
""Immelt clearly runs the best business at GE-GE Medical,"" Bill Fiala, an=20
analyst at Edward Jones, told Reuters. ""He's taken it international, and he=
's=20
done a fantastic job designing new products and capturing market share.""
He's a disciple and expert of Six Sigma, the quality movement that has been=
=20
made almost a religion at GE. Six Sigma is a complex, highly statistical=20
quality program that Welch wants as his legacy.
To make sure he understood the program, Immelt immersed himself in the stud=
y=20
of Six Sigma. Relying on his background in mathematics, he worked out=20
probabilities by using solid statistical research.
GE's next chief will replace an executive who has become a poster boy for=

1521,"Jeff/Ken:

I heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol yesterday 
and I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last 3 days, 
I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very close 
friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given some 
politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues about 
Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year, at 
about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading 
newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the 
pot. 

The facts however are as follows:

1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly 
behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the 
same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also 
believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.

2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan  
(thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves 
MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will 
then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently  control 
and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already been 
discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance. Obviously 
the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help GOM put the 
outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then discuss it with 
MOP on Monday. 

Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be apprised  
of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This was already 
done Tuesday.

3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day 
waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation 
at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer - 
subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under 
any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing to 
move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.

4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze the 
duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the current 
$35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff from Phase 
I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently with Ministry 
of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it favorably as the 
MOP is taking it up personally.

All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to 
believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the 
earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if the 
current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context of 
current and existing documentation.

I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has been 
scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the meantime.

fell sick. No agreements have been reached because there are none that are 
contemplated. All we have done is to encourage the GOM to approach the GOI 
for reducing their own liabilities. The details you will find in the other 
memo I have already sent to you. (I picked up your email after I finished 
sending my emails).  The approach as u will notice is no different than what 
we have been following all along and I believe that  you know that already.  
If u want further clarification, I am happy to discuss this with you or if u 
want to follow a different strategy then please let me know. I am at the 
Delhi Oberoi at  91-11-4363030, room 716.

Ken had expressed to me last week that you desired to take charge immediately 
and start moving the resolution of the Dabhol issues forward. I agree that 
this will be the best way forward. Given the way things are moving, I think 
that it would be best  that you arrive in Delhi immediately over the weekend 
so that I can introduce you to the players on Monday and start transitioning 
the relationships to you and Wade. Wade will join the team in delhi as soon 
as he is able to travel. Tuesday onwards I have urgent commitments in Mumbai 
that require my presence there.

As you can appreciate, your presence in these meetings will be essential for 
you to start getting a feel for the situation on the ground and developing 
the rapport with the key players. The GOM is clearly driving the train and if 
we are to assist them its essential that we not slow them down and assist 
them in any way we can. 

regards,

Sanjay

1525,"Dear Ken:  The purpose of this note is to seek your help in becoming a 
citizen of the US.

I've been a Houston-based employee of Enron for nearly 10 years, of which 
seven were with the Dabhol project.  I obtained my green card in 1992, which 
entitled me to apply for US citizenship in 1997.  I recently went through the 
final interview and was awaiting a call to take oath.

Instead, the INS denied my application for citizenship on grounds of my 
extensive travel.  This, despite the fact that:

(1).  A disqualification can be made only if an applicant is 

- out of the country for a continuous period of six months; or
- is out of the country for more than 30 months in the sixty month period 
after the green card.  (Neither of these apply to me).

(2).  I had filed a notification to the INS immediately after getting my 
green card (in 1992) informing them that I will be travelling extensively on 
business.  Filing this notification allows me to travel without the 
restrictions mentioned above.

Ken, I need your help on two fronts:

(1).  Support in filing an appeal to the INS.  This will cost an outside 
counsel between $1500-$3000.

(2).  Request my US Representative Mr.DeLay to send the attached letter to 
the local INS administrator.

I believe this will clear the way for my becoming a citizen of the US, to 
which I eagerly look forward.

Dear Mr. Lay,

You might recall very kindly hosting a dinner at The Travellers Club in
London for the first energy retreat that we did with Reinhold Heus and Ralph
Hodge. We were very sorry to have missed you this year though we very much
understand that campaigning for the elections was an absolute priority.

I was very pleased to hear that you had tentatively agreed to be able to
make the 25th May free for next years retreat. This years theme, after a
great del of research is set to focus on e commerce and the new economy and
will look at the inter relationship between energy, communication and
investment. I therefore thought that it would be particularly appropriate
given the outstanding work that you are doing in this area. I am sure that
you will feel that the participants are of great interest and I hope that it
will be a real learning experience for both the state companies and the
international energy companies.

As before the group will be limited to 60 top-level executives from
multinationals, independents and state companies and we would aim that some
of the main issues to be covered include:
* Corporate renewal - develop and maintain a competitive edge
* Diversification in the energy industry: into telecommunications,
power, water, e-commerce, trading, auto  - energy in the new economy
* E - Commerce
* Breakthrough in new technologies

I do hope that you are able to confirm your keynote attendance and look
forward to hearing from you.

I also thought that you might be interested in the attached outlining the
governments with which we work.
I very much look forward to hearing from you. .

In the meantime I remain,

Yours sincerely,

IRWIN M. STELZER
The Sunday Times
10 December 2000
    Buried deep in an issue of last week's Wall Street Journal is an
interview with venture capitalist Bill Davidow. As the crash in the value of
internet companies sours investors, and fills the financial pages with tales
of impending doom, Mr. Davidow has taken to reminding all who will listen,
""There was a tulip business even after the tulip mania."" Which prompted me to
dig out my copy of Mike Dash's Tulipomania -- subtitled, ""The Story of the
World's Most Coveted Flower & The Extraordinary Passions It Aroused.""
    Davidow is indeed right, and in the post-bubble history of the tulip
business may lurk some clues as to the history of the dot.coms, many of which
have been liquidated, while others have seen their values fall by as much as
90%.
    After the bubble burst, the trade in bulbs did not disappear. Prices
fell, but in a few years ""the trade regain[ed] some sort of equilibrium. The
speculators had gone, but there was still a market for the flower."" But at
far lower prices, with the specialty bulbs doing better than the garden
variety tulip. And it is not to stretch the analogy between tulip-growing and
the dot.com business to cite Dash's observation that ""most of the new and
inexperienced growers who had been attracted by the prospect of rich profits
gave up the business or were driven out.""
    Eventually, bulb growers learned how to turn a profit again. They
converted their business from a seasonal one to one that could produce all
year 'round -- something e-tailers have still to learn. They learned how to
destroy the viruses that periodically destroyed their businesses -- something
Microsoft et al. have still to learn. They learned how to compete with other
varieties of flower -- just as e-tailers have been learning how to click with
bricks-and-mortar retailers.
    In short, although the past is not necessarily prologue, history suggests
that there indeed life after a bubble bursts. For one thing, investors have
short memories: the tulipomania was followed by a spurt in the prices of
hyacinths in the eighteenth century, and by one in dahlias in 1838. Indeed,
as recently as 1985 prices of the red spider lily soared in China, reaching
$50,000 for the most coveted varieties, ""an amount that puts even the sums
paid at the height of the Dutch tulip craze to shame"", according to Dash.
    More important, the bursting of a bubble separates the wheat from the
chaff. The fact that the business graveyard is overflowing with the corpses
of dot.coms tells us less about the future role of the internet in our
economic lives than it does about the propensity of some to irrational
exuberance. It should come as no surprise that companies that not only failed
to earn any money as their customer lists swelled, but touted their mounting
losses as proof of their success in growing their businesses, should
eventually fall from investor favour.
    Nor should it be surprising that inexperienced entrepreneurs, whose sole
lasting contribution to American life has been the destruction of the
business suit, have discovered that there is more to running a successful
business than attracting the adulation of equally young and casually clad
reporters for trade magazines.
    Finally, it should not surprise us that the accumulation of data in this
era of the so-called ""new economy"" has led to a more sober appraisal of the
contribution of new technologies to the ability of the American economy to
grow without triggering significant inflation. We now know that the massive
investment in new technologies has increased the rate of growth in
productivity, and that the economy's speed limit has been raised to something
closer to 4% than to its old limit of about half that. That's not as
revolutionary as some of the more strident ""new economy"" advocates have been
claiming, but it is enough to make an unemployment rate of only 4%
sustainable in the long run without setting off a round of wage-price
inflation.
    What we have, then, is what might be called the residue of the dot.com
collapse -- a new way of doing business, greater productivity in important
sectors of the economy, lower transactions costs as buyers and sellers come
together without the intervention of middlemen, new exchanges in which
everything from electricity to broadband capacity can be traded efficiently,
and an increase in consumer power to resist price increases.
    These are permanent changes. The pace at which they are introduced and
become entrenched will, of course, be affected by the increased volatility of
share prices. Such volatility, after all, makes investment in shares somewhat
riskier, which is another way of saying that the price that entrepreneurs
will have to pay for capital to reward investors for taking these higher
risks will rise -- indeed, has already risen. But the improvements in
productivity and efficiency will not be reversed, even if the economy slows
significantly, as it now is deemed likely to do.
    Perhaps most important of all of our new knowledge is our increased
understanding of the use of the policy tools available to cope with economic
downturns. The market soared last week after Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan suggested that he was considering lowering interest rates, and the
Florida courts increased the likelihood that George W. Bush rather than the
more antibusiness Al Gore would move into the White House when the lease of
Bill and Hillary Clinton expires next month.
    Investors know that Greenspan can stimulate the economy by lowering
interest rates, which are high in real terms. After all, as discussed
elsewhere in these pages, he reversed a far more serious stock market plunge
in 1997 by easing monetary policy. Investors know, too, that the Bush team
aims to ease fiscal policy by pushing a tax cut through congress. That
combination of looser monetary and fiscal policies can go a long way towards
preventing this slowdown from becoming a recession.

that would facilitate dialogue  between energy producing and consuming=20

With  these objectives in view, a one-day workshop on =01+Energy Security=

elhi=20
Sustainable  Development Summit, which would focus on the challenges that=

underlie global  sustainable development, requiring unprecedented efforts o=
n=20
the part of  governments, corporate organizations, and civil society.=20

?Our  initiative in organizing this workshop is intended to complement the=
=20
efforts  that are already underway for ensuring a stable and secure energy=

sector in the  region. As a follow-up to the workshop, it is proposed to=20
disseminate the  discussions and proceedings thereby ensuring a wider=20
understanding of issues,  and to undertake cooperative research under each=
=20
priority  area.

?In  view of Enron's pioneering efforts in securing safe and stable global=

providing  financial support for this workshop to the extent possible, as=

well as  participate in the workshop. I am enclosing a copy of the proposal=

for your  consideration and would be happy to provide any further  details.

I am attaching a tentative itinerary for the wedding

He actually returned my call (I had left a message with his secretary

develop a power trading structure. He will put me in contact with someone

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Lisa Fane",Lisa Fane Ken Lay,the millions of dollars $100 million $101 million,Garfield Place Enron Enron Employee Transition Fund The New York Times

1693,"Mr. Lay,  I have received the proposal from Gulstream and will drop it off 
today.  As you probably already know, the flight from Beijing was a record 
first for the GV into Houston.

I have met and discussed the possibility of the GV replacing a 900B or a 
total fleet transition at length with John Stabler, Ron Fain and Keith 
Jones.  I have prepared a spread sheet showing the affect on budget as well 
as our thoughts and recommendations.
  
Although the cabin size of the Global Express is larger, Gulfstream is a good 
two years ahead of the Global in deliveries and fleet size.  They have 
overcome the mechanical problems that were experienced earlier in the 
program,  problems that  the Global Express may still be facing.  Worldwide 
support and operational experience have the Gulfstream far ahead of the 
Global Express.
  
Bombardier is still looking forward to demonstrating their aircraft to you on 
your India trip in December.

All of us at the department stand ready to do whatever you feel necessary to 
support Enron into the new millennium.       ","Lay GV John Stabler Ron Fain Keith

1697,"Mr. Lay,

I wasn't able to get my question to you at the all employee meeting. It was 
this:

The Enron sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed second and 
received free air time of ""Enron"" on the news. With NASCAR being as popular 
as it is today, itself a multi-billion dollar industry, why hasn't Enron 
sponsored a racing team to compete against the other Fortune 500 sponsors? 
Enron is supporting stadiums, but why not a competition based on fuel, 
energy, and the most powerful being the victor?

Now with cigarettes and alcohol banned from advertising, companies such as 
AOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek are on the tracks. Each race 
would provide more airtime of the Enron logo and further placement of ""The 
New Power Company"" in the retail consumer/viewer's venue. It would also give 
me someone to ""root"" for.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

COMMENT: I believe the Fed made a mistake on Tuesday. The 50-basis-point cut
in the federal funds rate was not necessary at this time. That was the
message from the bond market (rising yields), the yield curve (steepening
slope), and the stock market (rebounding prices) following the previous rate
cut on April 18. More recently, the rising prices of gold and gold stocks
also confirm the growing market consensus that the Fed may be easing too
much. The rapid growth in M2 also suggests that the Fed has done enough to
revive economic growth later this year, and may now be overshooting on the
easing side.

My main issue with the Fed's latest move isn't the rate cut itself, but
rather the press release that explained the reasons for the action. It was
almost a carbon copy of the statement issued by the Fed following the
previous rate cut on April 18. The message is that the economic risks are
still on the downside and that monetary policy is still biased to ease. In
my opinion, the message should have observed that the federal funds rate has
been cut five times in five months by 250 basis points to 4%, and that this
might be enough for now. The message should have been biased toward a
neutral monetary policy stance.

In my comment this past Sunday, I wrote, ""Now, the Fed is providing easy
money to minimize the pain resulting from the bursting of Bubble I, which
seems to be setting the stage for Bubble II."" Stock investors agreed with
this conclusion on Wednesday, a day after the Fed folks cut the federal
funds rate yet again. They understand that the Fed's rush to ease credit
conditions may not revive economic growth as quickly as the monetary
authorities would like. Instead, the resulting flood of liquidity is likely
to pour into the stock market.

Indeed, both the April 18 and May 15 statements clearly implied that Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues now want to promote a positive
wealth effect in the stock market to boost consumer spending. This is quite
a reversal from early last year, when the Fed Chairman worried that the
soaring stock market was pushing consumer demand above available supply.

Here is the relevant excerpt from the May 15 statement: ""The erosion in
current and prospective profitability, in combination with considerable
uncertainty about the business outlook, seems likely to hold down capital
spending going forward. This potential restraint, together with the possible
effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk
of slower growth abroad, continues to weigh on the economy.""

Here is the relevant excerpt from the April 18 statement: ""Nonetheless,
capital investment has continued to soften and the persistent erosion in
current and expected profitability, in combination with rising uncertainty
about the business outlook, seems poised to dampen capital spending going
forward. This potential restraint, together with the possible effects of
earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower
growth abroad, threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably
weak.""

The message is loud and clear: The Fed folks believe that the negative
equity wealth effect they helped to engineer over the past year has gone too
far. A rebound in stock prices is now welcome. The Fed's welcome wagon is
stocked with lots of bottles of champagne, and the speculators are drinking
the liquidity with gusto. The bubbly is bringing back irrational exuberance
fast. (For a complete history of the Fed's policy statements see
http://www.yardeni.com/FOMC.asp.)

As I stated in my Sunday comment, I like bubbles. You can make lots of money
very quickly when a bubble is inflating, as long as you get out just before
it bursts. As of yesterdays close, the S&P 500 was 25% overvalued based on
the Fed's Stock Valuation Model (FSVM). Five more percentage points and the
market will be as overvalued as it was just before the 1987 crash, though it
would still be cheaper than at the start of last year when it was 70%
overvalued. But that was Bubble I. Bubble II may surpass the 1987
overvaluation, but I suspect it will burst somewhere below the 70% level.

My asset allocation model, which is based on the FSVM, suggests that the
right stocks/bonds mix whenever the market is more than 20% overvalued is a
very conservative 60/40. (The recommended mix is 70/30 whenever the market
is 10% to 20% overvalued.) For the past few weeks, I have hesitated to lower
my stocks/bonds recommended mix from 80/20 because the Fed's liquidity party
is likely to drive stock prices up further. In addition, the sober bond
vigilantes are back trying to offset the Fed's easing policy by pushing
yields up. (For a weekly update of the FSVM, see
http://www.yardeni.com/public/stkvalu.pdf.)

If the 30-year Treasury yield rises closer to 6.5% and stocks become more
than 30% overvalued, which seems increasingly likely over the next few
months, then I may go to 70/30. If I think we are close to bursting Bubble
II, I'll suggest 60/40.

The Fed is certainly our friend. However, true friends don't let their
friends drink and drive. I would prefer an earnings-driven bull market
rather than a liquidity-driven one. For now: May the bubble be with you!

NEW ON SITE: For those of you, who still care about fundamental analysis,
please have a look at our new, improved EARNINGS MONTH with ""Squiggles
Inside!"" This publication includes our unique Earnings Squiggles analysis
for all eleven sectors of the S&P 500 and now 49 selected industries. You'll
find that P/Es are quite high and that earnings prospects are subdued in
many industries, especially Technology and Consumer Staples.
(http://www.yardeni.com/public/em_010516.pdf)

In the latest EARNINGS WEEK, Joe Abbott and I examine and compare the latest
earnings expectations for the S&P large, mid, and small cap sectors. Here is
one of our findings: ""All three S&P market cap groups are expected to record
a decline in Q2 earnings. Although Q2 earnings had been expected to decline
for the S&P 500 since the beginning of the year, it was only in the past
month that S&P Mid Cap 400 and S&P Small Cap 600 expectations fell into
negative territory.""

IN NEW ECONOMY WATCH/Snowflakes or Scuds?

""If the mainstream press is right, now is a good time to keep your
money--at least, the portion of it that you allocate to the
telecommunications carrier and service provider industries--under the
mattress. There's a house of cards that's about to come crashing down, and
you don't want to be anywhere near the neighborhood. ""Telecom Debt Debacle
Could Lead To Losses Of Historic Proportions!"" shouted page C1 of the May
11 Wall Street Journal, capping a wild month of ""Can You Top This?""
financial headlines. The Journal story followed close on the heels of
""Telecom Meltdown,"" an April 23 Business Week Special Report, a pair of
Barron's pieces featuring or highlighting Susan Kalla, the ""Dr. Doom Of
Telecommunications,"" and a widely read TheStreet.com interview with former
Lehman Brothers' bond analyst Ravi Suria, who boldly predicted that ""80%
of the New Economy telcos will have to restructure."" Kalla and Suria, not
surprisingly, recommend that investors steer well clear of both the stocks
and the bonds of telecommunications companies.

""The Journal says that the telecom shakeout is ""shaping up to be one of
the biggest financial fiascoes ever,"" citing $650 billion in debt
financing over the ""past few years."" Barron's counts $322 billion in such
financing over the past three years, and Business Week ($700 billion)
suggests ominously that ""the end of the dark days of telecom...are still a
long way off."" If those big numbers aren't scary enough, the Journal is
there to remind us that ""in the past six months, about ten telecom
providers have filed for bankruptcy."" The implication is that dozens more
are set up to follow in their footsteps. If you want to hear their names
repeated over and over again in that context, just turn on the television.

""Take a few spectacular corporate flameouts, add a relentless flow of
reportorial negativity, throw in some fire-and-brimstone preachiness--from
Wall Street, of all places--about purging excesses (whatever those are)
and punishing profligate offenders, and you wind up with an investor class
that behaves like Mark Twain's cat; which, having once found itself aboard
a hot stove, would not only never visit a hot stove again, but wouldn't
dare jump on a cold one either.

""Should you follow the cats? To mix up our menagerie a bit: can you count
on Chicken Little to tell a Scud from a snowflake?""

IN THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR/Hack This

""Before all else, I must establish two facts: first, I am a
'hacker'--i.e., someone who knows and enjoys computer programming. Second,
I grew up in Europe. Owing to one of the sillier rules of political
correctness, 'speaking as a Hungarian-born hacker,' I have now the
authority to say all kinds of critical things about the Finnish Pekka
Himanen and his new book 'The Hacker Ethic.'

""On the other hand, I also work at Microsoft, which, according to the
book, is the 'computer hacker's number-one enemy.' This, by the same
rules, would disqualify me as hopelessly biased. So let's just suspend the
rules, and I'll say what I think.""

June 2001's American Spectator is on newsstands now, featuring Brian
Wesbury on Alan Greenspan, Joe Queenan on Boomer funerals and Art Laffer's
strong buy on Japan. Oh, and an interview with someone named George
Gilder. Plus Microsoft Distinguished Engineer Charles Simonyi's unhedged
dissection of the open-source software scene, Rich Karlgaard on venture
capital and a cover girl who'll never be confused with Hillary Clinton.

FRIDAY FEATURE/Raving Loony Supply Siders

""High marginal tax rates distort work and savings decisions, and promote
unproductive tax avoidance and evasion activities. These tax distortions
create 'deadweight losses,' which lower the nation's standard of living.
Each $1 of marginal tax rate cuts would save the private economy at least
$1.25 as deadweight losses fall and economic efficiency increases.""

The Dead Media Project is an ever-expanding database of, well, dead media.
Television isn't there yet, but the early Baird mechanical version is
(full instructions included), along with the Vocoder, the Spartan code
stick, a complete list of deceased PC platforms and pneumatic typewriters.
Loosely maintained by science-fiction--okay, cyberpunk--eminence Bruce
Sterling and powered by a global network of volunteers, it's the kind of

1731,"In a letter last month (see Daily GPI, Oct. 19), Northwest announced a policy 
revision allowing a shipper holding capacity from Sumas to off-system 
delivery points to amend primary delivery points and shorten the path without 
being subject to a contractual OFO upon extending its contract term. However, 
citing ""the current OFO situation on the pipeline system,"" Northwest said 
last week the policy change is under review and has been suspended until 
further notice. 


El Paso reported Thursday an injection unit at its Washington Ranch storage 
facility had gone down for emergency maintenance. Capacity through Pecos 
River Station has been reduced by 100 MMcf/d until further notice, causing 
the pipeline to impose allocations on Permian Basin production and deliveries 
of San Juan Basin gas to the South Mainline. 


El Paso said work on Lines 1106 and 1107 was extended by one more day, 
causing the shut-in of deliveries into El Paso at the IUTBENED and IHYBENDM 
interconnects to continue through Dec. 1. The delay also postpones scheduled 
work on Line 3137, which now will be shut in Dec. 4-5, affecting the 
IVALEROZ, ISONORA, ISHOZONA and IBARNHRT points. Line 3177 is scheduled for 
Dec. 7 inspection, affecting IMOBILPE.

Per our conversation, PPL EnergyPlus requests that Transwestern assign
20,000 mmbtu of primary receipts out of the West Texas Pool for the

SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that 
TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to 
disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at 
the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we 
always do).  

If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C. 
Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of 
an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate.

went down due to a corrupted System volume.  The GTA server has an identical 
failover server that is being mirrored throughout the day.  Unfortunately, 
this data corruption also occurred on the failover's System volume.  In the 
recovery process, we were unable to bring up the failover due to the 
corruption on both servers.

Vendor support was required in order to recover GTA and the corrupted 
volume.  Although we talked to the vendor about possible causes for the 
corruption, our primary focus was on the server recovery.  The server was 
operational at approximately 11:10 am.  The Server Platform Team is working 
with the vendors to determine the root cause.

The following is a level ""A"" cost estimate to make TW/ Lonestar existing interconnects bi-directional.


TW/ Lonestar at Ward County ( 50 to 60 mmcf/d)


According to Operations this is already bi-directional . The only things are required on this one is to take the flapper out of the check-valve 
and blow down the gas in 5.33 miles of 12"".

Cost of gas loss& labor = $8,000

A): TW/ Lonestar interconnect


	Scope: On this one we need a bi-directional valve skid using the existing meter run.
	Cost of material& labor= $ 195,000


B): Pecos Compressor Station

    	 In order to make this interconnect bi-directional we also need to make the station ( two-compressor units) bi-directional.
	
Scope: Install outlet from Lonestar I/C to inlet filter with 12"" piping& valves. Unit discharge would be modified to
tie in to West Texas-20""
	
Cost for material& labor= $ 330,000.

1823,"Some thoughts, observations, suggestions:

1. Advantages to the single contract:

Don't need a consolidation agreement, so we don't have to negotiate one.
Better from a liability standpoint.
Easier to administer.

Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract?

2. Repayment/prepayment

I'm working with Steve on the letter agreement.

3.  Assignment to Mitsui

Steve is confirming payment issues, and ability to comply with GE's requested 
payment within 3 days of executing the contract.  This means that the 
assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE 
contract.  I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify, in Stan's absence.  
Peggy is checking on this, also.

4. Parent guaranty.

GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty.  From a quick review of the draft 
contract, it appears that a change in language will be necessary, since the 
current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment 
to a certain class of assignees.  If I am correct, then I suggest consider 
inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after 
execution of the contract, so that Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if 
necessary.

I suggest putting [brackets] around commercial operation as the date we can 
assign without consent.  As of now commercial operation is not a defined term 
(I hope it will become a defined term), so we may want to agree to a

		As you may or may not know, I am in the process of selling Enron's interest in our joint venture in Korea. We have a formal bid procedure underway, assisted by Goldman Sachs. Preliminary bids were received last Thursday , and final bids are due on January 7th. 
		I was reviewing the results of the preliminary bid submissions with Stan and Jim Hughes on Friday , when Stan suggested I contact you. With final bids due on January 7th, my target is to close and fund the sale by the end of January. When the sale closes, Enron will be out of Korea and no longer need my services here. As a bit of background, about one year ago , I needed to get my daughter back into the United States for medical and educational reasons ,so I repatriated my family to Orlando , Florida. At that time ,I (or anyone else) could have forecast the events that have taken place within Enron.
		Stan thought there might be something for me to do in Maitland , and I told him I would be interested in that or Houston for that matter. I had to leave Houston on Saturday to get back here, but I would like to give you a call to see if there is anything I could do in your organization.

Great to hear from you.   Overall, everything is moving forward as planned.   We have had informal discussions with Shell Gas Trading and Duke - both have expressed an interest but we do not have next meetings set up yet.   We just met with the IT group with Duke today, and I would like to meet next with the Marketing group - have you ever met Mark McFearson (VP Marketing)?

We have a big meeting with Williams on Thursday, 10/25 to meet with all of the pipelines and their Strategic Marketing group as well.   I had requested to have their Owensboro and Salt Lake City pipeline business units to come into Houston and they have accommodated us.   Williams requested a demo by EOL so I have also coordinated with Dan Diamond to present their package as well.  

Columbia Gulf and Kinder Morgan are next on our list to try to meet with, so it would help out if you could get us in the door with your contacts.   I have left a message with Julie this afternoon to call me on Monday to get some time with you to catch up in person.  I would like to discuss Luminant at that time also.

1913,"I had lunch with Dennis McConaghy.  He outlined three topics of interest that TCPL would like to take up with Enron-

Alaska Highway Project.  TCPL is keen to acquire Enron's residual interest in the ANNGTC partnership most urgently.  Their timetable is driven by the pace of political events (new enabling legislation was introduced in the Senate yesterday).  I disclosed that-
-ETS does not consider ANNGTC to be a strategic investment
-Enron Corp owns the residual interest
-the bankruptcy court would approve terms of disposal of the residual interest
-the sale of the residual interest is not a high priority for Corp given current operating circumstance
Bob Hill and I have been working on a plan to dispose of Enron's residual interest in the ANNGTC.  We're investigating if residual claims can be sold without being encumbered by liabilities accruing prior to Northern Artic Gas Company's withdrawal from the partnership.  We have canvassed other partners and there is definite market interest (Williams, PGE, Sempera).  I will follow up with Kim Wilkie to determine how to work thru the creditor committee and advise you of findings.

Northern Border.  TCPL is still interested in acquiring Enron's interests in NBP (GP and LP units) and are prepared to work on our timetable.  This is not urgent from their perspective.  Please advise if you require further assistance from me to progress.  I have not canvassed the market for other interest but would not be surprised if other pipelines are interested in bidding. 

McNeill Bullet.  TCPL would like to modify the principles of the joint development.  They propose the following-
-substitute Northern Plains for Enron in the joint development agreement
-stay silent on the equity splits at this time 
-leave open the possibility of Northern Plains being Enron's investment vehicle in the future
-TCPL is comfortable with Northern Plains being the operator
-restrict development activities to properly scoping the pipeline facilities and promoting the project
I believe there is merit to using Northern Plains as our development vehicle on certain conditions: (i) it does not go into bankruptcy; and (ii) it remains affiliated with the ETS pipeline group (access to corp capabilities).",Dennis McConaghy Bob Hill Williams Kim Wilkie TCPL,,TCPL Enron ANNGTC Senate Corp Northern Artic Gas Company's PGE Sempera NBP GP McNeill Bullet

In paragraph 8, I've proposed new language to address that pre-existing residual claims must be satisfactorily addressed before a new partnership agreement would be executed.  Also, I've outlined the possibility for other forms of ownership than just a partnership.  

In paragraph 9, I've outlined a non-exhaustive list of issues to be addressed in the joint development and coordination agreement.

During the next round of discussions following the MOU, I would like to explore the merits of rejoining partners having the right to rejoin as either a developing or non-developing party.  The outline structure I propose would be as follows-
- In either case, ownership levels are as set out in the MOU
- A developing party would have full voting rights and full financial responsibility during the development phase
- A non-developing party would make MOU payments but otherwise not have voting rights or financial responsibility
- A non-developing party could become a developing party at a specific time in the future and upon specific terms
- Non-developing parties would agree to release their claims for AFUDC and interest to the extent commercially necessary

Yesterday, Enron provided comments on the MOU which raise several new issues of substance. TransCanada & Westcoast recommend that these matters be deferred and included with our discussions on the commercial proposal and the Partnership Agreement, as we have agreed on a number of other issues.

As we discussed on Tuesday's conference call, we believe the first priority for ANNGTC is to finalize the MOU now, & put it ""on ice"", to permit all parties to obtain the required governance approvals by Nov. 15 - also the press release would be drafted, circulated & approved and ready to go at that time.

Secondly, the commercial proposal to ANS Producers must be initiated in early November to meet a mid-Dec. deadline. This proposal will of necessity have the group addressing the large commercial alternatives in order to establish a viable and attractive project.

The NNG Storage group is working on a potential project at the Redfield Storage facility that has 30% rate of return over 10 years. This project involves expense dollars rather than capital dollars to fund the project. The problem is that there is a negative EBIT during the first 3 years of the project that affects cash flow in a range from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 each year. Starting in year 4, going forward, the annual revenue will be $2,000,000 plus. What is your view of long term positive projects versus the negative impact on short term annual revenue targets?

STAN HORTON REPLIES 
Good morning, Steve. This particular project has not been presented to me for approval. I can tell you this, I like projects that have 30 percent rates of returns. I don't think I've turned one of these down! I look forward to reviewing this project with Danny and Dave and the NNG Storage team.

=20

r=20
EOL and our (and the markets) ability to transact even more quickly. =20
Transactions that took days to put together now can be done in 1 second. =
=20
Between the speed and the cost savings of having a fully integrated system,=
=20
we believe that our transaction numbers and percentages of online business=
=20
will significantly increase.

Changes in the industry
We discussed changes that we believe are coming in the industry.  We see=20
several things on the horizon.  We expect the acceptance of the online=20
transactions to further increase; especially with the volatile price=20
movements what we have seen in the last 6 months.  We are currently=20
developing several new products for EOL that I believe will become very=20
popular and will create new markets in coal and related sectors.  I don't=
=20
want to discuss them right now but we are close to releasing them and I thi=
nk=20
they will raise some eyebrows.    The development of the Global Coal exchan=
ge=20
will also help.  I frankly don=01,t believe it will be very successful beca=
use=20
of several things but primarily because of the difficulty in closing the=20
transaction. One thing has been very firmly demonstrated.  Every time a new=
=20
big system has been introduced EOL volumes go up.  It simply accelerates th=
e=20
acceptance of online business and it gets down to the best prices and=20
liquidity to see who will ultimately win the day.  Another big change in th=
e=20
industry is the growing acceptance of the OTC market.  The significant pric=
e=20
changes that have occurred have ""forced"" many traditional players to the OT=
C=20
market.  This also includes forcing them to agree to standard OTC terms and=
=20
conditions and getting them comfortable with the market.  This is very good=

for Enron especially when you consider that we are the major player on the=

OTC market.  We don't release specific percentages of what we are doing on=
=20
the OTC.  Also having more natural and traditional players signing these=20
types of standard agreements helps us on the EOL side because standard=20
contracts are important for developing a more liquid commodity market.

Enron coal volumes

On the physical side of our transactions, about 25% go physical vs.=20

Thanks for the email.  Here is my attempt to type out a response.  I hope it 
helps.

1.  It was a matrix organization.  The IT personnel reported into the Global 
Tech. group but we did that for communication and consistency  purposes 
rather than simply control.  They attended business unit staff meetings and 
the BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant 
feedback.  It was vitally important for the ""customer"" to be happy and that 
the IT person completed the projects from the BU.  When it came to the review 
process itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit 
had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.

2.  When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day 
working of the IT world.  IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly 
created 5th business unit at Enron.  Remember Global Technology had more that 
IT alone.  We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments 
group and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing 
around the world.

Philippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.  He is in the office 
of the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly 
appointed COO.  Both LK and GW are non IT people.  There are many VPs on the 
next level that are IT executives.

3.  In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience 
and title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the 
world.  He chuckled and said something like, ""That sounds like Enron, it 
always looks at things differently.  He then stated that my CEO title and 
Enron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place 
soon,  as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize 
it and change its culture"".

4.  When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the 
business ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.  For example, 
we were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated 
EnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it 
for free.  Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was 
going great.  We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that.

Gary, I hoped that helped.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have 
any other questions.

probably not approve this deal if it requires Enron equity to appraise 
reserves and if Sherrick is not willing to put equity in.  I have asked 
Sherrick to define his minimal ""bottom line"" position so that we can discuss 
it with Atlantis.

Sherrick's people got overly aggressive about this and tabled directly with 
Atlantis a new (and in my opinion, way over the top) proposal without my 
knowledge while I was in the air late last week.

Atlantis announced Saturday that they were walking the deal because EGEP's 
request is so outragious.  David Wilson, head of Atlantis,  immediately 
departed Houston for the UAE.  He is here now and is peddling the deal 
actively to others.

UOG to agree to a restructuring that does not require any front-end Enron 
equity, we risk losing this deal.  

At the same time, we have reached agreement with UOG that they will put up 
70% of the $40 million front-end reserves appraisal equity and they will pay 
Enron a promote and front-end success fee that will give us a return close to 
30% and them a return of 18%.

We risk losing this deal over $12 million of Enron equity to appraise 
reserves (and hopefully I can push a bit more of this risk onto UOG to reduce 
the number a bit more.) The deal would also give UOG and Dolphin a strong 
kick-start, and UOG is anxious to get it done.

Will advise after I talk more with Sherrick, UOG and Atlantis.  This deal 
will live or die this week.  I will have major problems with UOG if it dies.

Luncheon on September 6th.  It was a great event and a wonderful opportunity 
for those of you not familiar with JDF to find out what the JDF Walk is all 
about.  For those of you that were not able to join us, we missed you and we 
look forward to having you join us for our future sessions.

The Enron/JDF Team Leaders Kick-off Luncheon will take place on Wednesday, 
September 13th, at the Houston Metropolitan Racquet Club (The Met) beginning 
at 11:30 a.m.  I would like to encourage each of you to mark your calendar 
and make plans to attend this very important luncheon meeting.  At this 
kick-off meeting we will be distributing supplies and gift bags, reviewing 
important details about our campaign, learning more about JDF, and discussing 
our fundraising goal for this year's campaign.  Enron has been the number 1 
walk team in Houston for 5 years in a row and we plan to continue in that 
position and we need your help to make it happen!

either British Gas or BP/Amoco for fuel to supply the spanish plant.  Eric is

Below is some information that might be of assistance to you.  I don't think 
that I sent this to you when I got it.  If I did please ignore this.  D'Arcy 
Carroll (works for us in S. America) came to us from Cargill and knows a lot 
of people there.  He has a couple of names that I have passed on internally 
for consideration but I am sure they didn't go to the right place.  On a 
recent trip to Sao Paulo, many of the ag products came up in meetings as good 
opportunities for Enron to go in and change that industry.  Coffee, Orange 
Juice, grains and sugar were brought up a lot.

D'Arcy may have traded an ag book for Cargill, I can't remember.

Anyway, I am passing this message and names on to you for consideration.  A 
phone call to D'Arcy might also be worth a few minutes of your time.  He 
knows a lot about Cargill and has an opinion on how to capture their markets.

May 9, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
NYMEX Post-Close Trading Session Rules

DATE:
May 8, 2001
===========================================================

This Notice advises Members and Member Firms of changes to the two
post-close session rules applicable to the NYMEX Division.

!    As a result of amendments to both rules, the post-close sessions
generally offered Monday-Thursday will be the same as the Friday sessions
with two exceptions.

!    Monday-Thursday. These sessions will start at 3:25 p.m. and will be
two minutes long.

!    Fridays. These sessions will start at 3:30 p.m. and will be five
minutes long.


End of Week Post-Close Trading Session (Rule 6.57A)

As a reminder and as a follow-up to a Notice distributed last week, please
be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of amendments
to NYMEX Rule 6.57A, the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule,
will become effective. The new version of this rule is attached below.

For Friday post-close sessions (and for post-close sessions the day before
a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The sessions now will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks


Monday-Thursday Post-Close Trading Sessions (Rule 6.57)

In addition, please be advised that beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, a
number of amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.57, the Exchange's post-close trading
session rule for days other than Fridays, will become effective.  The new
version of this rule is attached below.

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

(3)  Customer participation will be expanded to the same extent as is
permitted for the End of Week Post Close Session. Please note that any
order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to
resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled
(GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for
purposes of this Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market
participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the Session,
a new order must be submitted.

(4)  As a consequence of the expanded trading range and customer
participation, trades done during this period will be price reported on
PRS.

Finally, please be advised that, as a matter of practice, the Exchange does
not currently offer post-close trading sessions for Propane futures
contracts.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

NEW VERSIONS OF  NYMEX RULE 6.57(""POST-CLOSE TRADING SESSION"") AND

the event that a market participant with such an expired order seeks to

Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading
day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close

Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the ""End of Week
Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and
subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or
the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week
Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in
all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of  five (5) minutes
in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the following
conditions:

(A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first
twelve listed delivery months;

(B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular
contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and
competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable

Unleaded Gasoline             50 ticks
Heating Oil                   50 ticks

(C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their
customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during
the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH
session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders,
limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have
expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.
Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired
order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be
submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be
reported on public ticker services;

(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week
Session shall not be considered in determining any settlement price; and

2045,"Debra,

It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday regarding the GISB
contract.
I look forward to receipt of your suggested language for the netting and
dispute resolution provisions, and your decision on the acceptability of
our Sections 10.3, 10.4, and 15 (Confidentiality).

Please do not hesitate to call if we need to discuss this further.
Unless you instruct otherwise, we intend to sign the Base Contract
first, and then FedEx partially executed originals to you for signature.

Thanks,
--Anthony

2050,"Concerning the status of Cinnabar, Mr. Shumway and I are currently discussing 
requested changes in the Guaranty involving letters of credit and damages.    
We cannot agree to their suggested change in language to the Guaranty.  
Therefore as some of their transactions are for 30-60 days and they are 
looking at on line trading,  I purposed for the short term a GISB.  He 
agreed, and I will be sending our draft of same to him for review (I will 
include you in my e-mail).   The issue of the Master is still open and I 
await his final response.

I will keep you informed of Cinnabar's status.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Conectiv Completes Nuclear Plant Sales=20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
[News item from PR Newswire] Conectiv (NYSE: CIV), an energy provider locat=
ed in the Mid-Atlantic, announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Atlanti=
c City Electric Company, completed the sale of its ownership interests in t=
hree nuclear plants to PSEG Nuclear LLC and Exelon Generation Company. The =
ownership interests were sold for approximately $11.3 million, excluding re=
imbursement of estimated fuel inventory, subject to adjustment.=20
Analysis: This announcement from Conectiv came out late last week, but I di=
d not want to miss the opportunity to provide some analytical commentary on=
 what I think is a rather significant development. The transfer of ownershi=
p in the three nuclear plants included in this transaction is significant b=
ecause of its relation to Conectiv's unique competitive strategy and the ro=
und-robin way in which nuclear assets are changing hands in the United Stat=
es. Further, despite an increase in acquisition activity around the nation'=
s nuclear facilities, we still are seeing only a small number of companies =
that actually own or control nuclear power in the United States. =20
The divestiture of the nuclear assets includes only what is Conectiv's owne=
rship in the plants, which Conectiv shares with other companies (who also h=
appen to be the buying partners in this sale). The breakdown of the sale of=
 nuclear assets is as follows:=20
A 7.51-percent interest (164 MW) in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station U=
nits 2 and 3 sold in equal shares to co-owners PSEG Nuclear and Exelon. Pri=
or to the transaction, PSEG Nuclear, an indirect subsidiary of Public Servi=
ce Enterprise Group Incorporated, and Exelon each owned about 46 percent of=
 the Peach Bottom plant. Exelon is the operator of the Peach Bottom facilit=
y.=20

A 7.41-percent interest (167 MW) in the Salem Nuclear Generation Station Un=
its 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which prior to the sale owned about 5=
0 percent of the facility. PSEG Nuclear will remain the operator of the pla=
nt.=20

A 5-percent interest (52 MW) in the Hope Creek Nuclear Generation Station U=
nits 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which is the operator of the plant a=
nd prior to the sale owned 95 percent of the facility.=20

As noted, the significance of these transactions relates to Conectiv's comp=
etitive strategy and the consolidation that is taking place in the nuclear =
sector. Let's look at Conectiv first. =20
According to Conectiv's President and COO Thomas Shaw, the divestiture of t=
he nuclear assets is consistent with the company's focused business strateg=
y on two core energy businesses: Conectiv Energy, the company's integrated =
generation and asset optimization group, and Conectiv Power Delivery, the c=
ompany's regulated delivery business. To support this two-tiered focus, Con=
ectiv has been in the process of divesting its baseload generating plants t=
o expand a generation portfolio that includes only mid-merit plants (units =
that have more flexibility to follow demand patterns). Mid-merit plants are=
 often viewed as units that fill the operating space between baseload plant=
s and peaker units. Whereas a baseload unit may have a generating capacity =
factor of about 80 percent, a mid-merit unit may have a generating capacity=
 factor of about 30 percent to 55 percent. From Conectiv's perspective, the=
 value of the mid-merit strategy is that these plants can be reserved to op=
erate only when demand is comparatively high. Further, the company believes=
 that mid-merit units are ideally suited to support the company's energy tr=
ading and asset optimization strategy because they are flexible enough to p=
rovide fuel arbitrage opportunities and ancillary service support when they=
 are not needed to meet higher demands for power.=20
The sale of the nuclear assets follows the previous sale of 1,081 MW of bas=
eload generating capacity by Delmarva Power & Light, a subsidiary of Conect=
iv, to NRG Energy and the divestiture of Conectiv's telecommunications busi=
ness (Conectiv Communications) to Cavalier Telephone of Richmond, Va., for =
$20 million. In addition, Conectiv sold its 50-percent stake in a 118-MW co=
-generation facility in New Jersey to Pedricktown Cogeneration LP, a non-ut=
ility electric generator, for $9 million. =20
Conectiv is divesting all of its baseload generation but has maintained own=
ership of some 2,000 MW of mid-merit generation in the Mid-Atlantic region.=
 The proceeds from the coal plant sales to NRG will reportedly be used to r=
epay debt and fund Conectiv's development of additional mid-merit assets. C=
onectiv's immediate goal is to build more than 4,000 MW of mid-merit power =
generation within the Mid-Atlantic region by 2004. Toward that end, Conecti=
v is taking some of the proceeds from the NRG transaction and using the mon=
ey to support a $300-million, 500-MW expansion of its Hay Road Generating S=
tation, which is currently a 516-MW plant that is primarily fueled by natur=
al gas. =20
The divestiture of both the telecommunications business and the baseload ge=
neration supports Conectiv's strategy of re-focusing on its core businesses=
, which are power trading and wholesale marketing (through mid-merit units =
only) and a regulated delivery business. Conectiv Power Delivery provides e=
nergy service to more than one million customers in New Jersey, Delaware, M=
aryland, and Virginia. Given the fairly distinct line between Conectiv's re=
gulated and unregulated businesses, I have previously speculated that Conec=
tiv could be preparing to spin off its unregulated businesses into a stand-=
alone company (a trend represented by AEP, Reliant and UtiliCorp). Conectiv=
 is in the midst of major restructuring, so it is unlikely that any such sp=
in off of its generation business would take place in the near term. Howeve=
r, as far as I know, Conectiv is the only energy company that has focused e=
xclusively on mid-merit plants. =20
Conectiv is also involved in merger proceedings with Pepco, a partnership t=
hat is scheduled to close in April 2002.  In this deal, Pepco is acquiring =
Conectiv for a combination of cash and stock valued at $2.2 billion. Both c=
ompanies will become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be named at a=
 later date. The partnership between these two relatively small and regiona=
lly based utility companies reportedly will create the largest electricity =
delivery company in the Mid-Atlantic region. By combining their two electri=
city delivery businesses, Pepco and Conectiv reportedly will more than doub=
le their customer base and expand their service territory by nine times.=20
In the nuclear sector, it is not terribly surprising that Exelon and PSEG N=
uclear would be the buying partners in the three nuclear plants sold by Con=
ectiv (despite the obvious fact that these companies already maintained maj=
ority ownership in the plants). Exelon and PSEG Nuclear are two of what is =
a small number of companies that are actively involved in the nuclear-power=
 space, and thus it is not surprising that they would be involved in the li=
cense exchange on these three plants. Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet =
in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear ind=
ustry, owning a total of 17 reactors. Earlier this year, Exelon CEO Corbin =
McNeill said he thought that a new nuclear plant would definitely be built =
in the next five years, and did not rule out the fact that his company migh=
t be the one to drive the construction of the new nuclear facility.=20
As noted, PSEG Nuclear is an indirect subsidiary of the Public Service Ente=
rprise Group Inc., which in 2000 was split into PSE&G, a regulated gas and =
electric delivery company in New Jersey and PSEG Power, an unregulated U.S.=
 power generation company. As noted, PSEG Nuclear LLC operates the Salem an=
d Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations in Lower Alloways Creek, N.J., and=
 oversees PSEG Power's ownership interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power =
Station, located in Delta, Pa. When the Conectiv transaction is completed, =
PSEG Power will own 100 percent of Hope Creek, 52 percent of Salem, and 50 =
percent of Peach Bottom.=20
In addition to Exelon and PSEG Nuclear, Entergy Corp. is another company th=
at deserves a mention when discussing the nuclear sector. Since 1999, Enter=
gy has been an active bidder on most every nuclear plant that has come onto=
 the auction block. Recently, Entergy bought Con Edison's Indian Point Unit=
s 1 and 2 nuclear power plants in Westchester County, N.Y. In addition, Ent=
ergy recently announced an agreement with the Vermont Yankee Power Corporat=
ion to purchase the 501-MW Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon, Vt=
., for $180 million. With the completion of the Vermont Yankee sale, Enterg=
y will own a nuclear fleet that includes 10 reactors. Also note that the  N=
ew York State Public Service Commission (PSC) just approved the sale of Nia=
gara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating station to Constellation Nuclear=
 for about $780 million. The purchase prices for the 614-MW Nine Mile 1 and=
 82 percent of the 1,142-MW Nine Mile 2 are about $221 million and $559 mil=
lion, respectively. Constellation is another company that has consistently =
increased its nuclear power assets.=20
Given the volatility of natural gas prices and the high emissions associate=
d with coal-fired generation, many industry analysts have debated whether o=
r not nuclear power is on the brink of resurgence.  Exelon, for example, is=
 involved in a joint venture that is attempting to commercialize a new nucl=
ear technology called Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR).  Supporters of PBM=
R believe its relatively small size (110 MW), anticipated short constructio=
n time (24 months) and cost ($1,000/kW) can once again make nuclear power a=
n acceptable option.  In February of 2001, Exelon filed an application with=
 the U.S. nuclear energy regulators to license a similar reactor in the Uni=
ted States.  Clearly, steps are being taken to revive this controversial in=
dustry.=20

So far my day's much quieter than yesterday...THANK GOODNESS.  Everyone and 
their brother harrassed me yesterday.  Here was the best one though.  A 
manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the 
analyst's) password to the VAR system so I could print some reports for 
him(the manager).  He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his 
desk when he gets here at 7:30.  Here's the best part though it takes about 
30 minutes to print all these reports.  So essentially he was asking me to 
come in at 5:00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 
7:30.  I told the analyst to tell him, ""Not just no, but HELL NO!!  I don't 
work for him, and  I have more important things to do.  If he had any 
questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further.""  Funny, I

Sorry it took so long to respond, but its been crazy around here.  Both KMI and KMP are still good buys, its just the overall market environment thats bringing these down.  Also, the commodities prices in gas and crude and fuel oil have come off quite a bit, which makes the general investors worry about the future earnings potential of the companies.  They are locked into contracts at a very good price, so whether the price of the commodity goes up or down they still make their cash flow targets.  Remember, the CEO of the company has a stack of over 25% of the company, so he is very tied to the overall stock price.  Enough said, invest your money into KMI and KMP, especially KMP since it has that yield of around 7%.  Talk to you soon.

I am getting on the boat in about 4 hours - midnight.  Actually, it's not
too bad that way as I go right to sleep when I get on.  I fly at night on
Saturday so I can sleep in.  Fortunately, I will only be on the boat for 18

Hopefully, the situation in Taiwan won't deteoriate between now and when I
get off.

Great news about the house!  Send us some digital photos if you have them.
I think it is better to buy a house that needs some work as you are able to
get more home for the cash.  Also, it is easier to turn a profit if you
sell.  Not to mention having some projects in work is always a good hobby.

beach.  Fortunately, reason got the best of us and we are waiting until we
get back before we make such a monumental decision.  There are just too many
factors involved to make the decision from some digital photos.  So, are you
planning on staying in Houston for a while?

A smaller wedding sounds like a good plan.  To me, having a few close
friends present is always better than a bunch of strap hangers.  However,
most chicks would probably disagree.  Marie seems to have had no regrets
with our ultra small wedding.  Just let me know what you need me to do to
help pull it off.

If all goes well, we will start heading home in mid-June and settle in
around early August.  I will also be home for Erin's wedding in May.  We
will also be doing some house hunting in Pensacola at that time.  We will be
in the states from the 20th of May through the 9th of June.  Let me know if
you are available on the first or last weekend and we will stop in Houston
on the way in or out for a day or two.  The tickets we buy allow us four
stops anywhere in the US.

The only wild card in all of this is Test Pilot School.  I applied to the
board that meets in May.  If I get selected, I would go to Maryland instead
of Florida and it wouldn't be until mid-November.  If that happens, and I
actually hope it doesn't, we would either stay here for a few more months or
go to Md. early.  Either way, I will be at your wedding.

Glad to hear from you,

Frank

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

I also have been meeting with AEP's Into Product traders to discuss the
implications of moving to the MISO.  Conceptually what we have been
discussing is a ""policy statement"" of the ""Best Practices"" for allocating
the rights, obligations and commercial risk as between Sellers and Buyers
of existing Into Product transactions based on the current definition
contained in the EEI contract in as much the same manner under an RTO
structure as possible.  Separately from that transition product issue, but
somewhat related, is a need to define on a going-forward basis the products
sold within these emerging RTO structures on the first day of operation and
as a market rules emerge.  I will endeavor to email a draft proposal Monday
morning to this group.

I am NOT available to participate in a conference call from 2-3 PM Central
time (3-4 PM Eastern Time) on Monday.  I could do 4-5 PM Central  (5-6 PM

Here are a few comments on the CalPX letter to FERC outlining the difficulties in calculating PX refunds.  

1.  The PX claims it is a ""neutral party in this proceeding"" and is only a conduit for cash.  True for PX business, not true for CAISO obligations.  The CAISO holds SC's responsible for non-payment, not the SC's customers.  The PX was the SC for most of the transactions going through the day-ahead and hour-ahead market.  Therefore, the PX is primarily liable.  I'm not sure how this helps us, though, since the PX has no money.

2176,"	As I think you guys know, the Sempra case is currently set for trial on October 11, 2001.  Given this week's events,  we believe that the trial date may be pushed back a few weeks; however, the current wisdom is that any delay will be slight.
	In the event you get any questions from anyone about this case, I attach a short (by my wordy standards) summary of the facts and issues in dispute.
	In addition to what is mentioned in the attached summary,  please note that we have two motions for summary judgment pending. The first is a liability motion arguing that the contract is clear on its face and supports our definition of Delivery Point.  If granted, this motion would dispose of all of the plaintiffs' claims, result in a liability judgment in favor of Enron and leave only Enron's damages to be tried. The second motion for summary judgment argues that, because the plaintiffs never made a claim for the tax credits they allege to have lost and cannot prove that they would not have received them, even if Enron was in breach of the parties' agreement, then plaintiffs' damage claim is entirely speculative and must be denied. 
	Finally, despite a good bit of effort on our part, several meetings and a business  related settlement offer made to plaintiffs several months ago, the plaintiffs have never responded or made a counter proposal.
	Please let me know if there are any questions about the attached.  Thanks.

<FW: [Fwd: Fwd: The importance of typing your email
addresses correctly]>>
           
It seems there was this couple from Minneapolis who decided
to go to Florida for a few days to thaw out during this particularly
cold winter.
Since both spouses worked, they had difficulty coordinating their
schedules, so the decision was made to have the husband leave
for Florida on a certain day, with the wife following him one day
later.
The man made it down to Florida and arrived at his hotel.
Upon getting to his room, he decided to open his laptop and
send his wife back in Minneapolis an email. However, he left off one
letter in typing his wife's email address and sent the email off without
realizing his error.  
In another part of the country, a widow had just returned from the
funeral of her husband, a Methodist pastor of many years, who had
been called to glory just a few days earlier. She decided to check her
email because she was expecting to hear from her husband's relatives
and friends. Upon reading the first email, she let out a loud scream,
fainted and fell to the floor. 
The woman's son rushed into the room and found his
mother on the floor. He glanced up at the computer screen and saw
the following email message:

To My Loving Wife:
I've just been checked in. Everything has been prepared for your
arrival here tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you then.

Your Devoted Husband.

P.S. Sure is hot down here.

2214,"Susan, Thanks for the draft exhibit. My first comment is that the general
approach taken by Socal tends to ""generalize"" the Socal receipt points by
noting all upstream pipeline market possibilities. I think this is helpful
in that we should stay focused on the Socal structure and not worry about
upstream mismatches. All receipt points apparently are mismatched so they
all are similarly situated. It would therefore be of no particular use for
the ALJ to dwell on this topic to long in this proceeding.

Some additional comments;

Wheeler Ridge - Incoming Interstate Capacity : ok , K/M testimony
unchallenged at 1 bcf/d
    - Take Away : PG&E No.Cal assumes full displacement volumes and
bi-directional flow
                            capacity of at least 200 mmcfd
                            K/M to PG&E - list 200 mmcfd , I know it has
physically done over         350 mmcfd
        Hector Rd. - ok
        K/M to Las Vegas should be closer to 200 mmcfd

Hector Road - Strike the asterisk and comment concerning Hector deliveries
limited by TW. Additional information not required.

No. Needles,South Needles, Blythe - OK ., Socal doesn't mention Sempra's
Mexico project

No mentions - Southern Trails Pipeline, All American or any other announced
but not in service pipeline project

Call if you have questions, if we can slightly modify this exhibit, it will
probably work.

The financial trader in Sydney should not be entering into master agreements 
for the trades he's doing for ENA-Houston.  The master agreement should be 
executed by ENA in Houston.  If that's not possible, our outside Australian 
tax advisor suggested having an independent agent (such as a lawyer) having a 
power of attorney from ENA and executing the trade (rather than Enron 
Australia).

This means that if ENA has already entered into a master agreement with the 
same counterparty, it would need to enter into a new master agreement with 
that counterparty.  Consequently, with respect to ENA negotiating an 
agreement with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Enron Australia will not 
need to execute a separate master for the trades that it is doing on behalf 
of ENA.  In this instance, ENA is considered the principal and Enron 
Australia is just performing services pursuant to the services agreement it 
has with ENA.

Please feel free to give me a call if you would like to discuss this further.

2235,"The following are my comments regarding the Buy Side Direct agreement:

4.6 Clarify justification for cancelling trades.  For example, user input 
error is not acceptable justification.    

4.7 Specify required lead time for Buy Side Direct to communicate changes in 
the agreement to subscribers ?

4.10 I do not have an objection to this clause.

8. Per section 5, subscriber is obligated to settle trades based on 
information subscriber inputs to system.  However, section 8 references no 
obligation on the part of Buy Side Direct to settle a trade in the event the 
other counterparty does not.  Given that the system will be anonymous, with 
Buy Side Direct acting as the counterparty for all trades, this obligation 
should be referenced.  (However, the agreements for all of the internet 
trading sites we are considering also appear to be silent on this issue.)   

 Buy Side Direct should be responsible for the accuracy of order and trade 
terms.

12. Should the agreement specify how and / or to whom Buy Side Direct will 
communicate material changes ?

17. Jurisdiction:  My understanding is that Enron's 1st choice is Texas but 
that we would accept New York.

",Greg Johnston,,
2239,"This is a forward power contract.  It is actually a one-off contract so no 
master agreement (and no CSA at least at the moment). It's an option 
arrangement whereby we have an option for each of four years (years 2-5 of 
the deal) to supply power at preagreed terms.  We pay the option premium 
during year one by means of a rebate to the customer of a fixed % of their 
electricity costs.

I guess we just have to include additional provisions to the agreement 
covering the various credit issues which need to be dealt with, but I am not 
quite sure where to start in a stand alone agreement situation.

Sorry about this.

Thanks.

Ps. We are under enormous pressure to get this deal done ASAP and in any case 
by Christmas - this is the first forward power deal we will actually sign.




",,,ASAP
2240,"As you are aware TD were concerned about the basis risk embedded in the 
prepaid swap structure . They plan to hedge their Enron exposure by buying 
credit default swaps in the market. However under credit default swaps, only 
a default on debt as defined by GAAP is  included as a credit event, and 
swaps are excluded from this definition .  This basis risk  therefore occurs 
where  Enron defaults on the oil swap but has not defaulted on any debt. This 
does not trigger a payout to TD under their credit protection, their recourse 
will then be through  the Corp guarantee with time delays. 

To mitigate that risk it was proposed that  in the event of an Enron default 
under the prepaid swap, the MTM termination value of the swap would be 
converted into a loan and Enron would automatically default on that loan. 
TD's counsel came back late on Friday to say that they could not give a clean 
legal opinion on this  structure.

We therefore proposed an alternative structure which involves TD and Enron 
entering into a loan of $10.1m at the same time as the swap is executed. This 
loan will  be in the name of Enron Corp. In the event of an Enron default on 
the prepaid swap, this will cross default into the $10.1m   loan and that 
forms the required trigger for TD's  credit default swaps.   The lawyers 
signed off on this last night and Norton Rose are now preparing the loan 
documentation.
They are basing it on the May 2000, 364 day Enron Corp facility and we are 
expecting first draft tomorrow. I will forward this to you when I receive it.


The deal itself is still undefined as TD have  credit approval subject to 
presyndicating the loan to two other banks and putting a certain level of 
credit protection in place prior to executing the trade.
The confirm/term sheet has not changed from two weeks ago and I have 
forwarded Sara's  comments to TD but their focus has been on getting credit 
approval rather than docs until today.  We have not sent a confirm to Morgan 
Stanley yet as we plan to replicate  whatever  confirm we agree with TD.  

I will keep you informed as to TD's progress.

2274,"Hi Tom,  at your request the execution of these agreements have been on 
hold.  Most of the leg work has been done.  I completed the negotiations on 
the agreement so moving forward is a matter of getting a document ready for 
signatures and getting it signed, having lawyers on both side proof read it 
and getting the agreement and accompanying documents (which are complete) 
executed.  This process, which is mainly administrative, could take two or 
three days if I focused on as a priority to make sure it gets done.

Regarding a ""hedge fund meeting"" next week, I have spoken with most of the 
likely participants and everyone is eager to meet next week.  I'll fill you 
in on details in person.  I think the following people should attend:

Fred Lagrasta

I believe that we have a mushrooming ""process"" issue.  I also believe that 
the credit group is part of the problem (we should have a separate discussion 
with Paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues - maybe there are 
none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit).  My observations 
are that all hedge funds need not be ""last minute"" deals, Caroline can be our 
ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal 
sooner.  I have asked Caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is 
currently working with, has already discussed with Paul or is considering.

Afternoon is best.  Shall I schedule or have you already begun?

2340,"I spoke with Scott Miller yesterday about several issues, so of course 
California came up.  Scott expressed frustration with the California 
situation and indicated that he thinks California will never be able to move 
away from its current problems without a comprehensive solution, led by an 
entity like the Administration.  Scott said he thinks all the parties need to 
come to the table and reach some sort of agreement to net out the differences 
between what suppliers are owed and what California thinks it is owed in 
refunds.  Once that is accomplished, the parties would then agree to enter 
into 1-3 year supply contracts at agreed-upon prices for the bulk of 
California's power needs.

Scott has been floating this idea with his colleagues (unnamed) who countered 
with ""Would Ken Lay agree to something like that?""  I told him that I agree 
there needs to be a comprehensive solution to California but I did not know 
what Enron would agree to.  I asked him if he has heard anything about the 
Vice President's task force and whether the report will propose something 
like this.  Scott indicated that he and his group have had no contact with 
the task force and he has no information as to what will be in the report.  
This workout plan is just Scott's idea for now.

Scott said he thinks the current scenario is unworkable, that there is not a 
lot of internal support for Hebert's approach, and that things will get 
worse.  For example, Scott said that although generators are the only 
suppliers subject to cost justification at present, if the problems continue, 
marketers will be subject to the same cost justification in the future.

I thought you all would be interested in this conversation.  I told Scott 
that since Joe has changed jobs, that he should feel free to call me with 
questions or to talk about things like this, and he also told me to call him 
whenever we need him.  Although Scott is not expecting a response from us on 
his California idea, if we do have some sort of response, we may want to 
convey it to him just to show our interest in working  with him and his group 
and that we have a similar interest in resolving the problems in California.

",Jim,,FYI
2345,"Today, FERC Staff held its conference to discuss what regulatory changes are 
necessary to promote further market liquidity.  The conference was fairly 
well attended by FERC staff, including Dan Larcamp and  Shelton Cannon.  

Some common themes:
Gas markets are generally well functioning and major changes are not 
necessary.
Commodity markets are very liquid.
FERC policies, GISB and Order 637 have helped to make capacity markets more 
liquid.
Shippers are unhappy with tighter tolerances and new balancing services in 
Order No. 637 compliance filings.
Standardization is necessary to promote liquidity (with pipelines making the 
distinction that standardization of transactional protocols is a good idea, 
standardization of product offerings is not).
There is very little consensus on further areas for change.  In nearly every 
case, a change advocated by one shipper group is opposed by another.  
In any event, most said that now is not the time for sweeping changes.

Areas without consensus:
Shipper-must-have-title rule.  LDCs argue it should be removed; while Process 
Gas and producers think that removal will undermine the capacity release 
market.
Production area rate design.  LDCs argued that they need the ability to buy 
service downstrream of a market pool.  Reliant and Koch also argued that 
pipelines should have to have separately stated production and market rates.  
The producers opposed any attempt to shift costs to the production area.
SFV.  East Coast LDCs, Michcon, and APGA argued for moving off of SFV.  The 
producers and industrials oppose.  Illinois Power/Dynegy also argued for 
moving off SFV.  


LDC Positions
The LDCs main themes were removing the shipper-must-have-title and enabling 
LDCs to hold space downstream of market centers.  However, they also argued 
that  pipelines should not be permitted to offer new services to the electric 
generation market that reduce the flexibilities LDCs have historically 
enjoyed since the system was built for LDCs .   This is the point that AGA 
raised in the blanket intervention to all Order 637 compliance filings.    
Carl Levander of Columbia did a nice job of refuting the notion that LDCs are 
entitled to unwritten flexibility that they have enjoyed in the past on a 
best efforts basis, perhaps in part due to the fact that the pipeline may not 
have been fully subscribed.  LDCs, generally stating that 637 compliance 
filings did a poor job of allowing capacity segmentation, continued to stress 
the need for segmentation, including ""geographical segmentation of ROFR 
capacity.""  

Some Specific Proposals
NGSA called for more targeted information to be included in Form 2 filings.  
A number of customer groups noted the need for more and better information, 
though specific needs were not well defined.
Several parties ask FERC to reconsider national standardized penalties 
(especially given expected high prices this winter and the possibility for 
arbitrage).
Alliance of Energy Suppliers (marketing arm of EEI) called for a dialogue 
between power generators and INGAA to develop a new firm tariff with hourly 
variability.  They also called for a change in GISB nomination deadlines to 
match the power grid (Dan Larcamp asked whether EEI is open to efforts to 
standardize scheduling times across the power grid as well).
The GISB End-User group (represented by Salt River Project)  complained about 
the need to standardize the confirmation process and called for gas 
transactions to be ""tagged"" like electric transactions.  

E-Commerce and Capacity Trading
Dave Neubaurer did a great job of driving home the themes that capacity 
trading can occur if FERC and industry are willing to allow more speedy 
transactions, remove posting periods and long contract execution periods.  He 
made an effective case that no major regulatory changes are necessary.  
Robert Levin of the NY Mercantile Exchange echoed this theme, admonishing the 
FERC not to micro-manage the types of trading platforms or to try to insist 
on a single platform.  He said that liquidity cannot be legislated.  From his 
perspective, natural gas markets are the best functioning commodity markets 
in the world.  FERC should worry about transferring the ""good stuff"" from 
natural gas to electric markets, not the reverse.",Dan Larcamp Shelton Cannon Koch Carl Levander Dave Neubaurer Robert Levin,,"FERC Staff FERC GISB APGA SFV Illinois Power/Dynegy AGA Columbia ROFR

2346,"Rick, thanks for the note. I will be in touch with you and Stefan Diescher on 
this. The issue I have been faced with, however, is 
simply this: I am covering power and gas for three countries on my own. The 
demands on my time have been enormous and I have given
Viviana as much of my time as possible. Indeed, at the last PRC, there was 
significant pressure to place her in the ""has issues"" category
and I resisted on the grounds that she needed more time to find her stride. 
We have had a number of long meetings where I have noted
in detail what my expectations are and provided her with suggestions on how 
to improve. This has included helping her outline a research paper
how to write a slide presentation, what research sources to go to, how to 
extract information from people on the phone. In a better world
I would spend more time with her to bring her along, but I am horribly 
stretched and need a researcher who is more effective to help
me get the job done. I have also gotten other feedback (including from the 
head of the Frankfurt office) that has been rather negative.
My view is that rather than prolong the mutual agony, we should begin the 
process of managing her out and helping her secure more
appropriate employment outside the firm. Please let me know what you think.

 ",,
2351,"Met early this morning with Jack Steward (pres. of CMA) and Keith McCrea 
(lawyer for CMA) to follow up on the meeting that Steve and I had with them 
regarding the proposal Ken Lay was pushing last week:

They like taking Tx out of the MOU, they like getting DWR out of the power 
purchase business, and they think that Edison's MOU needs a little haircut.
McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore (""why should it be mandatory to 
go the market?""), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for 
core/noncore has a lot of merit.
Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when 
the markets settle and prices come down, 2)  everyone (core and noncore) 
should pay for DWR's ""past"" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core 
customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates 
the core's ""net short"" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would 
not have to pay for any of DWR's ""going forward costs"" (since core gets them, 
in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation)
I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects 
would be and would share it with them when we're done.
While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful 
to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the 
necessary support to get passed.  They are also withholding final judgment 
until they see all the numbers, i.e., we've still got some work to do.
They are very cynical about anything getting solved in California, and are 
extremely upset about the PUC's proposed rate decisions released by the judge 
and Loretta Lynch.  They place very little trust in the Governor or the 
Legislature.
Interestingly, the rate increase decisions, coupled with calls in Sacramento 
for an immediate move to core/noncore, makes our proposal very attractive to 
CMA.
Nonetheless, they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to 
commit to continue meet to try to get California's mess resolved.","Jack Steward Keith McCrea

2352,"PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on 
Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into 
California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the 
original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what 
generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will 
expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, 
or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed 
""Gas Accord II,""  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for 
the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD 
contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and 
EAD), to be ""open-seasoned"" at some ""future"" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) 
on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might 
auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any 
specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level 
of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any 
questions, just holler.

2353,"I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

like to discuss the waiver of conflicts section with you):

Page 2, item (3) should read ""The payment of a ""project fee"" of $175,000 upon 
the achievement of each milestone described in Exhibit A to this letter.

Item (4) should read ""The payment of a ""project fee"" equal to 2% of the 
project's total cost upon the achievement of the milestone described in 
Exhibit B to this letter.

Exhibit A should read as follows:

Individual milestones subject to ""project fee"" payments:

1. With respect to Haywood Power I, L.L.C. (""Haywood Power""), the abandonment 
by the Tennessee Valley Authority (""TVA"") of its proposed 320 MW expansion of 
its Haywood County, Tennessee facility (""Lagoon Creek""), which results in 
Haywood Power being allowed by TVA to interconnect into an existing 500kV 
open bus position in the Lagoon Creek substation. Achievement of this 
milestone shall be evidenced by the interconnection specifications set forth 
in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the 
milestone shall be deemed to be achieved upon execution of said 
Interconnection Agreement.

2. With respect to Haywood Power, the decision by TVA to eliminate the 
Network Upgrade related to the reactive power requirements as set forth in 
Haywood Power's System Impact Study, presently estimated at a total cost of 
$5 million.  Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the Network 
Upgrade requirements set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA 
and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be fully achieved 
upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement to the extent such Network 
Upgrade cost is eliminated. To the extent that such Network Upgrade cost is 
less than $5 million, but greater than zero, a pro rata portion of the 
$175,000 project fee shall be paid.

3. With respect to Calvert City Power I, L.L.C. (""Calvert""), the elimination 
of TVA's present requirement for Calvert to pay for a Network Upgrade 
consisting of the construction of a new 30 mile 500kV transmission line from 
Cumberland to Montgomery. Achievement of this milestone shall be deemed to 
occur upon (i) Calvert having determined in its sole and absolute discretion 
that the overall project economics of its 510 MW generation facility are 
viable, and (ii) execution of an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and 
Calvert.

Exhibit B should read as follows:

The development and construction of a generating facility in cooperation with 
or partnership with certain distributors of the TVA (a ""Development 
Project""). Any such Development Project shall initially be proposed by Wyatt 
or Sideview Partners, Inc.exclusively  to Enron. Enron shall have thirty(30) 
days to make a determination as to whether to proceed with any proposed 
Development Project. Enron shall not have any obligation to proceed with any 
Development Project. At such time as all definitive agreements related to the 
Development Project have been executed, the Development Project shall be 
deemed to be an approved Development Project (an ""Approved Project""). For 
purposes of payment of the project fee, the milestone shall be deemed to be 
achieved, for Approved Projects only, 50% upon the commencement of 
construction of the Approved Project, and 50% upon commencement of commercial 
operation of the Approved Project. For the avoidance of doubt, a project fee 
shall not be payable for any Development Project unless it becomes an

Clark ( Senior V.P. Exelon - Government Affairs, etc) and Arlene Juracek 
(V.P. Rates and Tariffs).  Sue and I also met with Commissioners Hurley and 
Harvill.

Information Gleaned From the Meeting:

1.  Com Ed does not think price volatility will be acceptable to the 
residential customers and wants to create a structured rate.  They are not 
open to any alternative that causes them to lose money.
2.  They will file a rate case in 2004 to be effective in 2005.  They are not 
sure the statute requires them to file an MVI plus 10% at the end of the PPO 
period and need to study the statutory requirements.  Their preference is to 
initiate performanced based ratemaking instead for bundled rates.
3.  Com Ed's view is that the energy situation is a  national problem.  Com 
Ed wants to be protected through its commodity price.
4.  Com Ed does not want the obligation to serve industrial customers and on 
a longer term basis, would like to shed its obligation to serve residential.
5.  Com Ed has arbitrarily defined mass market as 400kw or less and has 
therefore lumped these commercial customers in with their residential, 
however, they are open to separating them out.
6.  Com Ed does not want the legislation reopened which may provide us with 
some leverage.

At the conclusion of the meeting it was decided to start an open forum 
process to get ideas on the table.  Com Ed is shying away from any formal 
process.  Their concern seems to be that they do not want to take the 
political heat for high prices and volatility and would rather give up its 
default customer service obligations.

Possible Deal Opportunities:

1.  Either through negotiations (preferred choice) or through competitive 
bidding, become the default service provider for some or all of Com Ed's 
industrial customers.  This would allow us to upsell additional products to 
the industrial class.
2.  Segregate the commercial customers (100 - 400 Kw) customers from the 
residential customers and negotiate to become the default service provider.
3.  Joint venture between ENA and New Power to be the default service 
provider for portions of the residential class through an opt-out program 
like municipal aggregation or some other format.

Next Steps:

1.  Mark Ulrich is to complete an analysis of the Com Ed proposal in terms of 
its impact on our current book of business
2.   Develop a position boiled down to just a few key points that we can push 
with regulators and Com Ed.  In a conference call with Harry, Mark, Roy, Sue 
and me, we have tentatively distilled the list to the following:
 a.  Default deal for industrial customers
 b.  Negotiate for Com Ed to provide load following and balancing
 c.  Default deal for commercial as opposed to PBR

I was disappointed to learn of Philippe's departure from Enron.  I have been continually impressed with his accomplishments and more importantly, at his extensive knowledge of Enron's business and priorities.

I would like to submit my name for consideration as a replacement for the position of CTO at Enron Networks.  I realize the importance of the role that I fulfill with Enron Broadband and understand how difficult it would be at this time for me to leave EBS; however I could not allow this opportunity to pass without expressing my interest.  I am sure that a suitable solution could be formulated if it was determined that I would be the right fit for the CTO role.

I appreciate your consideration, and will make myself available if you would like to discuss my qualifications.

    I would like to report on the fabulous show of support displayed by my
many Beta brothers this weekend at my book unveiling in Norman -- Woody,
Benson and Grumbles from Dallas; Porter and C-Ci from Tulsa, along with
Strange and Ellsworth from OKC. Hess tried to get there, but a cancellation
in the original party venue kept us from seeing him.

    Thank God I am a Beta. I was touched beyond belief to see your smiling
faces Friday night, especially during a time when I am catching shit here.
The original party was cancelled three days in advance a Nazi named Dr.
David Boren, the president of OU (and faggot), who was pressured by the
monied assholes, who were siced on me by Jay Wilkinson, who didn't like the
things I wrote about his father, which, the way, are true.

     My brothers were wonderful this weekend, in spite of the fact that
Woody heckled me during my speech, and Grumbles tried to hustle my best
Sunday girl. I guess Woody had a right. He drove all the way from Atlanta,
then had to turn around drive back to Dallas after the party. But, Woody,
you still owe me for conspiring with Hutch to shut me out of the Beta
offense.

    Back to Hess. My most humble apology. (I have sent a personal email to
Hess). I thought everyone knew that the party had moved, but, as it turned
out, he slipped through the cracks. I put a notice on the Beta wire about
the change and signs were posted at the Sam Noble Museum. By by the time
Hess arrived, the place was dark and closed. Sorry brother Hess. I will make
it up to you somehow.

    Guys, you are the greatest, and the best friends I've ever had in my
life.

IN THE NEWS...
Many Adults Have Obesity Syndrome
A recent study from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention found that at least 47 million Americans - more than one in five - have the cluster of health problems known as metabolic syndrome.  This condition, thought to be caused by a combination of genes and lifestyle factors, such as overeating and lack of exercise, includes heaviness around the waist, high blood pressure, poor cholesterol readings and elevated blood sugar.  Metabolic syndrome greatly increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke.

News on NCEP III
The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has introduced new guidelines for evaluating risk for cardiovascular disease.  The revised guidelines use the Framingham Point Score in determining risk assessment of new cardiac events within a 10-year period.  In a notable new feature of the guidelines, the Expert Panel has now recommended that the presence of diabetes be thought of as equivalent to the presence of established heart disease.  The new guidelines also target the newly defined metabolic syndrome as a target for aggressive preventive therapy.

One Step Closer to a Cure
In type 1 diabetes, which occurs in nearly one million Americans, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, stopping insulin production and wreaking havoc on blood sugar levels.  For this reason, people with type 1 diabetes must administer insulin to themselves on a carefully controlled basis. Researchers at Harvard Medical School recently found that in mice, the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas can regenerate themselves, giving hope that this new method of fighting the disease could draw science closer to a cure.

Aspirin Therapy for Hearts Defended
Aspirin has long been the basis of blood thinning treatment for people with cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack and stroke.  It is not, however, usually prescribed for those that have conditions that put them at risk for cardiovascular disease, such diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels and chest pain.  Recent research could change this.  A report from Oxford University in England shows that small doses of aspirin (75-100 milligrams per day) significantly lower the risk of heart attack or stroke for those at high risk due to related conditions.

Final Reminder

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, all trades among your investment funds must be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26.

The makeup of your investment funds in the Savings Plan at 3:00 p.m., October 26, will reflect your investment decision for the duration of the transition period. ",,,Enron Corp. Savings Plan
2412,"
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

401K and the cash balance retirement plan are 2 separate plans.  You are 
automatically enrolled in the cash balance plan - you would be eligible to 
participate for the year 2000.  Going forward, at the end of each year, Enron 
will set aside 5% of your salary into an account (Enron directs these 
funds).  This account has a 5 year vesting period meaning that you must stay 
with the company for 5 years to be eligible to receive these funds when you 
leave.

the difference.  I'm trying to come up with a summary list or some other kind 
of reminder to send out to the traders today. I.E. is FPL part of Florida 
Power & Light? What's a quick and easy way to determine which counterparty 
you're trading with? 

We've just been bombarded with reports of incorrect counterparty names in our 
deals, and more often than not the traders are unaware of or indifferent to 
the difference. For your sake (and ultimately theirs, since these errors will 
start adding up in the daily correction report), I want to develop a more 
efficient system of checks and balances. If you have any suggestions (other 
than asking the traders to wake up and pay attention!) please let me know 
when you get a chance. I'll just be brainstorming today....in between 
changing incorrect counterparty names!

",Chris Kate Kimberly Allen,,"FPL Energy Power Marketing FPL Florida 
Power & Light"
2430,"I've received some feedback from the Real Time group regarding these 
counterparty discrepancies. Apparently, they were never given notice of the 
correct counterparty names, and chose what seemed to be the most logical 
name. Can we come up with a system or master list of usable counterparty 
names for these guys to refer to when faced with an array of choices? (i.e. 
There are five different names under Transalta.) 

The concern lies with our daily correction report, which I generate and which 
includes all deals that have been changed and the name of the person who made 
the ""error."" This report can weigh unfairly against a trader who may be 
unaware of the difference between ""Dynegy Marketing & Trade"" and ""Dynegy 
Power Marketing."" I feel like there has to be a more efficient way to avoid 
these errors than publishing them in a report that gets sent throughout the 
company.

If you could help me compile this master list, or direct me to someone who 
can, I would greatly appreciate it.

I've visited with almost every department in our office trying to figure out

Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he 
found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which 
they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the 
schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to 
Idaho in the hour-ahead market.

if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and 
kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation 
of what happened)? Just let me know, and we'll do what we can to help.

+ THIS WEEK ...

""However much we think of poetry as a disciplined scatter of words on
white, or the proud aestheticism of the thin volume,"" Sven Birkerts
writes in Atlantic Unbound this week, ""it remains, at root,
historically and performatively, a pneumatic event. Pneumatic, from
the Greek root pneuma, relating to wind or air, but inescapably
carrying overtones of 'spirit' and 'soul.'""

Poetry has been the soul of Atlantic Unbound from the start. In fact,
the very first Web-only feature produced for The Atlantic's site,
coinciding with its official launch on November 1, 1995, included
recordings of Robert Pinsky reading excerpts from his acclaimed
translation of Dante's *Inferno*, the sound of his voice streaming
over the Internet in RealAudio 1.0, or downloaded in 8-bit .AU files.
(See http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/aandc/dante/danthome.htm --
and don't worry, the audio quality has since been upgraded.)

Five months later, on April 1, 1996, we launched the Poetry Pages
(http://www.theatlantic.com/poetry/). Featured that month were Peter
Davison's introduction and readings of Robert Frost's poems from the
August, 1915, Atlantic, along with readings by Rodney Jones and
Stephen Sandy of their poems appearing in the April issue,
inaugurating our ever-growing Audible Anthology of Atlantic poems
read aloud by the authors. (The anthology now contains more than 200
recordings by 81 poets. See
http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/poetry/antholog/aaindx.htm)

This month, to mark the fifth anniversary of the Poetry Pages, we're
presenting three text-and-audio features: Frank Bidart, Peter
Davison, and Robert Pinsky read Robert Lowell's poem ""For the Union
Dead"" (originally published in The Atlantic for November 1960), with
an introduction by Davison; Christopher Ricks reads and comments on
T. S. Eliot's ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock""; and Sven
Birkerts reviews newly released recordings of Randall Jarrell, one of
the twentieth century's great poet-critics, reading his own poems
(you can hear Jarrell reading ""The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner""
and ""The Woman at the Washington Zoo"").

Read, listen, and enjoy.

Cheers,

Wen Stephenson

* A post-script to our longtime TransAtlantic readers:

This is my last collection of Web-only features commissioned and
edited as editorial director of The Atlantic Online, though I'm happy
to say that they are not the last poetry features I will edit for the
site. (I'm leaving the staff of The Atlantic next month, but I will
continue to edit the site's Poetry Pages.) I am profoundly grateful
for having had the opportunity to work on The Atlantic's online
edition for what is almost seven years now. And I am grateful most of
all to my Atlantic colleagues, past and present; to the many writers
who have lent their words and their voices to our cause; and to you
our readers, who have lent your eyes and ears. Best wishes to all. -WS

out with Constellation. The way he explained it, our position is flat with 
Constellation, so for settlements purposes we're okay - i.e. We've bought the 
same volumes that we've sold, and we end up losing a bit due to the index 
offset - but otherwise the index price won't make a difference.  But I 
suspect he's not thinking of the problem from the confirmation standpoint. 
Could you tell me exactly what needs to happen to clear this up on your end 
so that I can explain it to Bob in a way that might make him DO something? 
I'm sorry for the delay on this - I'm getting ready to call Bob's contact at

2534,"Thanks for the update, Ryan. I've forwarded the e-mail along, and hopefully 
you'll continue to get a good response from all the Blazer fans here. I had a 
chance to catch last night's game - if you could call it that - against the 
Kings. Now all we have to do is pull a Tonya Harding on Chris Webber and 
we've got a chance at the championship! 

I also thought I'd mention that I'm no longer in the same position with 
Enron. I moved into commodity trading a few months ago, so TECHNICALLY I'm 
not the point of reference for Blazer matters - Mollie Gustafson is. I've 
retained the title only because I happen to be the most outspoken fan on the 
floor; so I love receiving all the latest news. But if you ever have a more 
urgent matter, or, for example, when it comes time to renew our season 
tickets, you'll want to call Mollie. She's the woman with the checkbook, so 
to speak.

2537,"Yeah, Seattle actually had a 7.0 earthquake at about 11a.m. our time. I made 
it out from under our building with only a broken leg and shattered.....no 
just kidding. What's funny is that I was on my way to lunch when the 
earthquake hit Portland, and for whatever reason - my conspicuous 
absentmindedness or the cold medicine I'm high on - I didn't feel a thing. I 
walked out into the streets of downtown to ambulances screaming all around 
and ladies freaking out and running out of buildings. I went to the little 
soup stand I always go to, and the soup guy asked if I had felt the 
earthquake, and I said, you know it's funny but I DIDN'T. And he said, well 
that IS funny because I didn't either. But I think we're the only two who 
didn't notice it. Weird, huh!

2539,"Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck in 
those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are going 
really well though (Rocky Mountain ""highs"") and that you've made it through 
most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain ""lows""). Amber 
tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour, he mentions how 
they've got to get together with you when she comes to town - which will be 
on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets to go and I don't, 
being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of college and therefore do 
not enjoy such things as ""Spring Break Mania"" anymore. And Monica tells Marky 
who tells Amber who tells me that she'd love to hang out with you more often. 
It sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner, eh? So you've got options, 
girlfriend, which is worlds more than I can say for my life at the mo'. It 
pretty much consists of working, eating, and sleeping. I'm definitely looking 
into that SAD mental disorder thing, because I think it's got me in its 
clutches. But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed 
energy to start thinking about life after winter. We're doing lots of 
gardening, cooking, and decorating at the house - it's like having three 
Martha Stewarts all working together, only slightly less stylish , immensely 
less efficient, and drunk. Other than that, I've been trying to organize and 
simplify my life - taking care of mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, 
sorting out all those nagging little post-it notes that plague me constantly 
and demand my attention in vain. I'm actually starting to see the light at 
the end of the tunnel, like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few 
months, or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy 
just yet. So I heard Dad and Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods 
with an automobile. That is, in the immortal words of the guys in ""Dude, 
where's my car?"", SWEET... DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load 
off - just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your 
head. Take it from one who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old 
beater car; but then I start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and 
suddenly $30,000 doesn't seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. 
Lately I've been doing a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I 
just applied for post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking 
economics and poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from 
work!) I'm also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get 
serious about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies 
and/or economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found 
my dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a 
two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington 
and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does it 
get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for 
government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in 
my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not 
getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it, dude. 
As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so much 
energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as I'm 
having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By the 
time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in 100 
million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest paragraph of 
my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a thrilling tour 
of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in exchange for a 
finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the information for 
it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever make it home for a 
weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray is coming to the 
Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your concert ticket if you 
can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me soon if you can, or I'll 
call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!

Love,
Kate

2542,"Yeah - I pretty much became part of the furniture yesterday as I recouped 
from the brutality of that weekend. I ended up at a random friend's house at 
about 4 a.m., then proceeded to down a couple beers and head for bed at about 
6:30. I could not believe it when my alarm went off this morning - it's a 
cruel, cruel world when you've got a social schedule like ours. But I 
definitely had a good time Saturday, despite the fact that I was ditched by 
my ride and locked out of my house, which is never fun after a dozen 
cocktails. All in all, though, great party.",,,
2543,"Yes, this is correct. Les Rawson, our services guy, did this deal which he 
explained is a little strange because the company we're buying generation 
from didn't want to provide firm energy, so we're selling the unit contingent 
instead of firm to Avista. Anyway, that's how he tried to explain it to me. I 
hope that helps.

* contracts with ENA re: ETA and 
* contracts with Singapore re: GTC

Was there any particular reason that you chose the PA to be with ENA rather

about 1/4 inch. The temperature was about 35 degrees and it wasn't windy-so 
it was just a great day to walk the streets and take in all the snow.  It 
just felt like Christmas.  We took a  carriage ride around Central Park and 
they dropped us off at Tavern on the Green for lunch.  Met one of my contacts 
at Prebon for lunch and he  paid for it. .  Good  thing because we were 
drinking mimosas at $10.00 a pop.  We saw two great plays-Aida and the Lion 
King.  Excellent. Actually, Aida may be the best broadway play I have ever 
seen.  The music was awesome.  Lion King had great special effects with all 
of the costumes. The people were dressed like animals and it was really 
cool.    Prebon got us tickets for that too-first row-center section-mezz. 
level.  In other words-perfect seats.  On Saturday, we mostly shopped during 
the day.  Deb bought herself a new David Yurman diamond ring  and red leathe 
coat. You can't believe the people that were shopping.  We went to FAO 
Schwartz early-9:00 a.m.-and at 3:00 the line was clear around the building 
to get in.  The large department stores were like that too-hoards of people.  
You could hardly walk down 5th avenue, it was so crowded.  I have never seen 
so many mink coats in my life.  Everyone had one on.  The hotel we stayed at 
was excellent.  It didn't have the view you did.  Nothing will ever match 
that.  But all three of us stayed in one room and the room was huge and 
nicely decorated.  All three of us were able to get ready in a span of one 
hour.  We ate at some good restaurants too.  The first night was this small 
Italian restaurant.  Very authentic.  They took good care of us.  The second 
night was Thai-food was excellent.  The third day was French.  YUM YUM.  We 
got out of town just in time.  We really lucked out.  I would go back agai n

2608,"Good Morning,

Exciting News!!  We now have a new Portland Web based IT incident & tracking 
application to replace the existing Westdeskitissues.mde Access application.  
The new Web based solution adds several key enhancements that will hopefully 
improve IT response time and improve our communications back to you when 
problems are resolved.

Here are some of the key enhancments:
1.  Ability to query outstanding & resolved issues.
2.  IT problem/resolution knowledge base.
3.  Web page that displays important IT contact information.
4.  Automatic email notifications to resolution team members.
4.  And much, much, more.

For those of you who may be new to the office, or may have forgotten about 
the old Westitissues.mde application.  This application is continuously 
monitored by the production support team for infrastructure (PC's, Monitors, 
terminal-server, LAN, WAN, etc) and application (Enpower, Portcalc, CAPS, 
etc.) problems or enhancements requested by users.  This database is also 
summarized to capture metrics which are then used to evaluate the performance 
of the IT group.

Here are the steps to using the new West Desk Problem Tracking System:

New Login:

1. Go to http://westdesksupport/
2. Click the Login button towards the bottom of the page.
3. In the UserName Box, Enter:  ITWD.
4. For the Password type in: Password.
5. On the next Screen, fill out all the information. (Only certain fields are 
required, but filling out everything is preferable)
6. After Clicking the submit button, you are going to be asked to login with 
the new username and password you created in the New User Area.
7. Upon submitting, you will come to the main index page.

Adding a WorkOrder:

1. On the Main index page, click on the link add incident to log under the 
heading of West Desk Links.
2. Fill out as much information as possible. For IT Contact, please enter 
appropriate contact, or if you are not sure, select mtully.
3. Select Priority. (This may be changed by IT)
4. Submit form.

Note: For the description and response fields, you may use html tags for the 
formatting of text for display.

The rest is pretty self explanatory. If you hover your cursor over a link or 
picture or text box, a texttip will appear and tell you what that link or 
textbox is for.

Thanks,

Mike Tully
Trading Floor Support

P.S. When entering a incident, there are two different types of ""NEW 
Requests"". One is New Request (Problem). This is used for reporting an error 
or problem with an application. The other is New Request (Enhancement) which 
is used for requesting an enhancement to an application.","Mike Tully

I just talked to Palo alto.  They would like to schedule a conference call for tomarrow, noon our time.  I told them it would be up to you.  Please let me know if this gives you enough time.

This is true.  The master agreement would apply only in the event we would
be buying gas from Enron on a long-term basis.  Typically, Nova and ANG
would have your company assign the capacity to SMUD on their contracts.
Same with PGT on the capacity release mechanism.  Calvin

this looks good to me.  Stephanie is checking with Transwestern to see what their parking/lending fees would be for weekends, just for an idea.  I am also talking to the desk.  I will keep you posted.

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully, we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

One suggestion.  In Section III, given the reference to all dockets in the related filing, the second sentence should be changed to read:
