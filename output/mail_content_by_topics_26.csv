When we spoke several days ago, I had mentioned the meeting between Jeff 
Shankman and Larry Kellner, CFO, at Continental Airlines.  The meeting had 
been scheduled for December 11th, 2-3 PM in EB 3321.  I will know tomorrow if 
this date is confirmed.  Following our phone conversation, I did follow up 
with the persons you suggested -- Larry Gagliardi, Douglas Friedman and Mark 
Tawney -- as I completed an overview of our initiatives with Continental.

The meeting on December 11th will enable Enron and Continental to continue 
discussions on three initiatives listed in order of economic value:  (1) fuel 
management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR 
analysis.  

In order to verify attendees at this meeting, Jennifer Burns suggested that I 
follow up with you.  Please note the Continental attendees listed below.  Did 
you want to have the same origination team at the meeting or others?  I look 
forward to your response so I can coordinate with them and confirm their 
attendance.  Continental had requested that we keep the Enron attendance to 3 
or 4 persons; they will do the same.

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)


We appreciate your suggestions.
Thank-you.

wide as last year.  Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip.  
Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango.   if it 
couldn't do it this year....
A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve 
told them to do last bid week.  Obviously, more gas trying to come out than 
is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an 
Enron, to inject.  Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling 
it out in G.  When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, 
cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f.  Storage 
economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of 
winter.  Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways.  
Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong.  storage boys 
are withdrawing today and buying that.   bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it 
going to zero?

I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  Bill 
Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is an 
extremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today as 
someone ""who thinks outside the box"".  Bill actually sat in a bar four years 
and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has been 
successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.  
As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.  He throws out 
ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointed 
out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally 
don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for 
Enron.  In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within 
reason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be 
considered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit risk 
exposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as an 
independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for 
someone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill not 
conducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitor 
his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he is 
at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade 
counterparty.

I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread 
option he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the 
trading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that 
Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This 
was one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing 
models created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that 
they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental 
price limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, 
for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within 
variable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a 
correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously, 
we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this 
methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since 
been changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very 
few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.  

Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to 
Enron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting 
credit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade 
considering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise.

Here's the full article from ESPN's Clayton for  more detail.? 
http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1114/877559.html?? 
?
While not issuing an update on the injury Tuesday,  the Denver Broncos were 
fearful enough of losing quarterback Brian Griese because of his separated  
throwing shoulder that they told backup Gus Frerotte to be ready to play the  
rest of the season, ESPN.com's John Clayton reported.
?
Griese's injury is officially listed as a separated  AC joint. The Broncos 
said Tuesday they aren't likely to know about their  quarterback's 
availability for Sunday's game against San Diego until later in  the week. 

Griese was injured in the first quarter of  Denver's 27-24 win over Oakland 
on Monday night, but he returned to the lineup  and helped engineer the 
victory. 

""We won't know for a couple of days the exact  extent of the injury,"" coach 
Mike Shanahan said. ""We'll wait to see how sore he  is."" 

Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said Griese could be out  a ""significant period of 
time,"" adding, ""It looks bad."" 

Asked after the game if he expected to play  against the Chargers, Griese 
said, ""I don't know. I can't tell you what's going  to happen, what my 
availability will be for next week. I've never had an injury  like this, but 
I'm going to do my best to come back and play."" 

Griese already was playing with torn cartilage in  the same shoulder, which 
will require off-season surgery. He insisted the two  injuries are unrelated.

determine any required missing information.    When possible, we will try to

Is the data/information automatically fed into SAP from another system?
Please provide samples of reports/queries (including detailed calculations) 
that demonstrate the information you desire.

107,"I wanted to let you know how thankful I am for the help I received from the TW scheduling group over the past couple of months as I've worked--and struggled--on the TW Daily Balancing Report. I have made repeated phone calls to Houston and have always received prompt and courteous attention from the group as I've tried to understand TMS and TW's systems and scheduling peculiarities. I have worked with Amy Mulligan, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, Christine McEvoy and Bert Hernandez.

In particular, I felt impelled to let you know that Bert Hernandez has been especially helpful in my endeavours. Bert and I spent many hours on the phone discussing TW's scheduling intricacies. He has been very patient with me and always made himself available to me to answer my questions. He was able to discuss in great detail many TW transactions, including why and how transactions appear the way they do, and what the transactional data means. He even went so far as to ask other departments for explanations as questions arose, rather than referring me to someone else, and never failed to follow-up on a question I had.

In short, I could not have made the progress I have without Bert's help.

The report is still being finalized, but Marketing and Gas Control have already employed the report with great success in managing Transwestern pipeline activities. Incremental gas sales deals were done in June and July utilizing information from the report, and the Commercial Support and Financial Accounting groups are looking at the report for ways to employ it in their work.

Again, I just wanted to pass along to you that your team was instrumental in the development of the report, and I wanted to give them the appropriate recognition. I thought I'd better send this now as opposed to waiting for PEP, lest I forget. I also believe that good news shouldn't wait. We don't always hear enough of it!

Thanks again!

Tariff, which is Agenda Item 5B for the May 24 BIC meeting.

As you may know, the translation of the In-City price cap from ICAP to UCAP
is a pending item from the proposed ICAP Manual. The ICAP Working Group
concluded at its last meeting that, if the parties could not agree upon a
translation number, the matter should be taken to FERC for a decision.

FERC Staff has agreed that FERC will take up the issue if no consensus is
reached. Alternative positions on the translation issue will be laid out in
the cover letter to the Tariff filing; comments from any party interested in
filing on the translation issue would be due ten business days after the ISO
files the proposed Tariff. The attached motion seeks approval for this
approach.

The ICAPWG may withdraw the motion if consensus is reached before the BIC
meeting.

aloud...

     to my true-blue, dye-in-the-wool, RED, WHITE & BLUE friends,

   Opening my e-mails and watching the news coverage on the
Clintonlover News Network this past week, i happily realized that
i live in a nation of heroes and patriots.
   Those firemen, police officers and volunteers in NYC who are
working around the clock to try to rescue people richly deserve to
be called heroes, for indeed they are TRUE HEROES  (how many of my
friends, how many of YOU, would be there, among the ruins, if some
assholes had, say, hit the Transco Tower ? would i ? i know a
certain OD who might have, but how many more ? just wondering...)
They ARE heroes.
   Now about the patriots, all 280,000,000 of them.
   An ""unusually high number"" of people run to their local Wal-
Mart to buy a flag, and CNN calls America a nation of patriots.
It is ONE thing to tie a bloody ribbon to your Lexus or pick-up
truck (never understood the public display, shouldn't we mourn in
our hearts ? no problem with it, whatever floats your boat, just
find the PUBLIC part strange), it is altogether ANOTHER thing to
pick up a weapon and go fight the fukkin' Mujahedins in the
fukkin' Afghan mountains (there are no Starbucks in Kabul, just
ask the Soviets...)  REAL war, no smart-bombs-live-on-CNN-safe-on-
your-couch-Mickey-Mouse war;  REAL war, maybe for the first time
in history, on American soil.  We know the fukkers will be
committed, will our side be ?  Strange thing, commitment.  When
the Bolsheviks fought the White Russians, Feliks Dzherhinsky
compared it to bacon and eggs;  he said that the pig is COMMITTED,
the chicken is only INVOLVED.  He knew what he was talking about:
he was a pig (literally, bastard founded the KGB), and he won.
   So, let us all take a deep breath (if anything, just to mourn
the innocent victims in NYC and DC), and call things fo what they
are, a duck a duck and a poodle a poodle (sic!)  Those people in
NYC are heroes, we'll find out about the patriots.

PS

  Notice how when the camelbastards wanted to hit at the SYMBOL of
America, they hit the World Trade Center.  Ummm, isn't there
something called the Statue of Liberty, not a mile away?
  ""Give us your poor, give us your weak, give us your down-trodden""
  ""America, the craddle of democracy, the moral compass of a
misguided world""  ???
  People will die for their beliefs, and those things are worth
dying for.
  America's greatest virtue is its wealth, not its moral
superiority, the evil bastards hit at the true heart of America:
      They hit Corporate U$A
  America won't go to war, 280,000,000 people don't believe in
Coca-Cola all that much.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

153,"California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=

Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your voice 
mail and was glad to be in the loop.

In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of 
issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits 
pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for 
Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).  

Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain 
the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there 
another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references 
from prior employers, etc.)?  

As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that 
address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the 
information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine 
how to proceed.

Energy Secretary Names Bonneville Head

WASHINGTON, DC -- Department of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced
today the appointment of Steve Wright as administrator of the Bonneville
Power Administration (BPA).  BPA is a federal agency that markets wholesale
electrical power, principally from federal dams in the Columbia Basin, and
operates high voltage transmission for the region.  It is based in Portland,
Oregon, and serves Washington, Idaho, Oregon, western Montana and small
parts of contiguous states.

""Bonneville is extremely important to maintaining a vital economy and
healthy environment in the Pacific Northwest, and I have confidence it will
continue to do so under Steve Wright's direction,"" said Secretary Abraham.
""Steve exerted outstanding leadership through some of the most turbulent
times for the electricity industry and has effectively worked with diverse
constituencies in the region,"" added Abraham.

Wright has been with the agency for 21 years, beginning in the agency's
conservation department.  He has served as acting administrator since
November 2000 following the departure of then-Administrator Judi Johansen.
Wright's tenure has spanned some of the region's biggest energy
challenges--including a West Coast energy crisis and the second worst
drought recorded in Pacific Northwest history.  

Wright said he was particularly honored to have come through the ranks to
have the opportunity to lead an institution that is critical to meeting the
economic and environmental objectives of Northwest citizens.  ""I'm committed
to operating BPA as a sound business enterprise, but one whose mission
starts with meeting our responsibilities to serve the public.  That means
striving for strong environmental stewardship, low rates, reliable service
and being open to the public's ideas about how best to use the assets that
provide so much value to the Northwest,"" Wright said.

Wright began his work at BPA in 1981 shortly after receiving his masters in
public affairs from the University of Oregon.  Following a stint in the
agency's energy conservation office, he moved to BPA's D.C. office in 1984.
In 1987, he began managing the agency's California office, then went back to
the D.C. office as manager in 1990.  In 1998, he returned to BPA
headquarters in Portland as Corporate senior vice president where he had
responsibility for public affairs; environment, fish and wildlife; finance
and budget; strategic planning; and human resources.  He became deputy
administrator in 2000, followed shortly by his appointment as acting
administrator.  

He and his wife, Kathleen, and their three children live in Portland.  In
addition to his  masters, he holds an undergraduate bachelor of arts degree
in journalism from Central Michigan University.  He is 44 years old.

Who Let the Hot Dogs Out? Rhapsodic Lawmakers;
Legislature: Speaking frankly, officials have used the wiener as an easily
digestible metaphor for the state's energy crisis.

BYLINE: JULIE TAMAKI, MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Every crisis has its symbol.

??Watergate had Deep Throat. The S&L scandal had Charles Keating. O.J. did--or
didn't--have a bloody glove.

??Here in the Capitol, the hot dog has become an unlikely metaphor for the
state's energy crisis.

??In packed news conferences and heated Assembly floor debates, lawmakers from
both parties have evoked images of the ordinary dog to help explain an
extraordinary mess.

??The genesis of this statehouse trend is difficult to determine. Assemblyman
Fred Keeley appears to be the first to have tossed the hot dog into the
political fire.

??During a crucial Assembly discussion in January, the Boulder Creek Democrat
recited the lyrics to a familiar Oscar Mayer jingle as a way of admitting 
that a
controversial bill to have the state buy electricity to avoid blackouts was
unpalatable, but necessary.

??""It's the dog kids love to bite,"" said Keeley of the jingle. ""Well, this is
the bill people love to hate.""

??A bizarre, partisan hot dog duel ensued. Assemblyman John Campbell 
(R-Irvine)
responded by likening the unpredictable financial consequences of the Keeley
legislation to biting recklessly into mystery meat.

??""Before I bite into it I see what's on the outside, but I can't see the
inside,"" Campbell said. ""If nobody can tell me what's on the inside, it may be
bitter, it may be bad, it may make me sick.""

??Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) angrily fired back, wanting to
know why Campbell, a professed hot dog eater, was suddenly so critical of its
unknown contents.

??""It's OK to eat a hot dog that's full of animal bones and hair,"" Migden 
said.
""That's a hot dog that's OK with you, but this kind of hot dog isn't.""

??Yet it was Senate leader John Burton who made it the key ingredient in a
Capitol catch phrase.

??Burton described a plan to purchase the electrical power grid from the
state's private utilities as a fair swap, saying: ""I give you a dollar, you 
give
me a hot dog.""

??The sound-bite quickly took on a life of its own. With the cost of the 
energy
crisis growing faster than the price of ballpark franks, critics doubted the
public's appetite for a multibillion-dollar hot dog.

??""Do you really want a hot dog? That is the question,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones,
executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade group for 
power
generators.

??Not content to let a dog lie in its bun, lawmakers such as Assemblyman Bill
Leonard (R-San Bernardino) kept the hot dog in public discourse.

??When Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection, Leonard was
one of a chorus of legislators who questioned the merits of purchasing the
remaining portion of the power lines, calling it ""not even half a hot dog.""

??Added Assemblyman Bill Campbell (R-Villa Park): ""It's like paying Mercedes
prices for a broken down hot dog cart.""

??In recent weeks, the hot dog rhetoric appeared to have gone cold. Then
Assemblyman Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) revived it.

??After enduring hours of testimony on details of the deal to purchase 
Edison's
power lines, Vargas said his opinion of the dollar-equals-hot-dog deal had
diminished.

??""They're trying to charge us for a hot dog,"" Vargas said of the utility, 
""but
it looks like we're only going to be getting a wienie.""

??Reliant Vice President John Stout also recently weighed in with his own hot
dog analogy as he tried to explain why his company's income had jumped so much
during the crisis.

??""If you have a hot dog stand and you go out and buy five to six more hot dog
stands,"" Stout said, referring to his company's purchase of power plants, 
""then
naturally you would expect the operating income to go up.""

??Alas, the dog days of summer have yet to begin.

HEADLINE: Davis asks U.S. to limit firms' prices;

RATE SWINGS: Governor argues 2 generators manipulated market

SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis pursued a new strategy yesterday to control wholesale
electricity costs by demanding that federal regulators ban two generators from
selling power in California at market rates, arguing that they have 
manipulated
the market to their advantage.

???Meanwhile, the Davis administration lambasted a federal plan to implement
temporary price controls, scheduled to go into effect Tuesday. State officials
said the measures would do nothing to tame California's out-of-control costs 
for
electricity.

???Davis, whose calls for broader price limits on wholesale electricity have
been rejected repeatedly by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is
scheduled to meet with President Bush next week to ask Washington to do more 
to
help California.

???""Federal regulators said that prices were 'unjust and unreasonable' nearly
nine months ago, but they have been AWOL ever since,"" Davis said in a 
statement.

???The California Independent System Operator, managers of the state's
electrical grid, asked energy regulators yesterday to revoke the authority 
they
have given Williams Energy and AES Inc. to sell power at market-based rates.
Instead, the Davis administration wants the companies to be forced to sell at
cost-plus rates, which would ensure a reasonable but limited profit.

???""Market-based rate authority is not an entitlement,"" the ISO said in a
filing with federal regulators.

???The ISO asked regulators to act by June 15, saying that any delay ""places
California consumers and the state's economy at extreme peril.""

???Similar filings against other companies, such as Mirant, Duke and Reliant,
are being considered, said Charles Robinson, general counsel for the ISO.

???Robinson said the ISO has a ""well developed"" record of price manipulation 
by
the two companies. He said information previously given to federal regulators
proved the prices charged to California were excessive.

???'GRANDSTANDING' ACCUSATION

???Aaron Thomas, a spokesman for Virginia-based AES, said the administration 
is
grandstanding.

???""This is akin to the rhetoric the governor has used for the past several
months,"" he said. ""We are well below the index FERC uses to establish concerns
about market power.

???""As to this rhetoric about these companies abusing the marketplace -- check
the facts. We lost money last year,"" Thomas said.

???A spokeswoman for Williams said the company would not comment because it 
had
not seen the filing.

???Earlier this month, Oklahoma-based Williams agreed to pay $8 million to
settle charges with FERC that the company was purposely withholding 
electricity
from California's power market. The company admitted no wrongdoing, and
officials said a full hearing would have cleared the company.

???If the regulatory commission denies the state's requests, or doesn't ""act 
in
the time frame we believe is necessary to prevent harm,"" the state can appeal 
to
a circuit court, Robinson said.

???BUSH VISIT POSTURING CHARGE

???Jan Smutny-Jones, head of the Independent Energy Producers Association, 
said
the move is posturing by Davis ahead of Bush's visit.

???""This is an interesting welcome mat for President Bush,"" he said. ""Do we
want a dialogue or a diatribe?""

???In advance of Bush's visit, Vice President Dick Cheney said yesterday that
nothing more can be done to help solve California's power problems this 
summer.

???He also rejected price controls, saying that previous efforts have
contributed to a supply shortage.

???A spokesman for Davis rejected that notion and denied that the timing of
yesterday's announcements were connected to the Bush-Davis meeting.

???Davis aides expressed hope that Bush's two new FERC commissioners, Pat Wood
III, a close Bush ally expected to take over the chairmanship of the board, 
and
Nora Mead Brownell, a state utility regulator in Pennsylvania, would hear
California's pleas. The two new commissioners were confirmed yesterday by the
U.S. Senate.

???Among the things Davis wants changed is the regulatory commission temporary
price relief plan scheduled to take effect Tuesday.

???The regulators would limit wholesale prices during power alerts in
California, when reserves drop below 7 percent of available capacity.

???Many state officials believe that doesn't go far enough. The state 
Assembly,
in documents to be filed Tuesday, said price controls should cover all hours 
--
not just power emergencies.

???And there is a chance the controls will be in effect for just a few days.
Under the regulatory commission plan, the state and the three investor-owned
utilities must file a proposal to join a regional transmission organization by
June 1. If they do not to do so, the price controls disappear.

???Davis administration officials expect to file another response dealing with
the regional transmission organization by Friday, Robinson said. The Assembly
filing rejects joining such an organization, which federal officials favor as 
a
means to better manage and improve grid capacity in the West. E-mail Lynda

196,"Hello Everyone,

We've gotten word back from Jim Fallon to go forward with obtaining CLEC 
licenses.  This brings us to the next set of questions:

Which entity do we license?  EBS or ETI?
If we license ETI as a CLEC, can we transfer EBS' IXC licenses to ETI?
Do we get CLEC licenses in all states, or some strategic subset of states?

I'd like to put together a group to address these questions, working with 
legal, tax, and commercial people.  Please let me know if you are interested 
in participating in this group.  It most likely will involve a fairly 
intensive schedule of meetings in Houston during December.

We should hold off on filing new IXC license applications until we have 
resolved the EBS vs. ETI issue.  For states where an EBS IXC license 
application currently is pending, let's not be too aggressive in pushing 
those applications forward over the next month.  Give me a call if this 
creates a problem in any of your states.  Also, Scott, please let everyone 
know if there are any fiber-build states where you think the delay would be a 
problem.

Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

197,"The proceeding that EGA is currently participating in will hopefully result 
in a retail adder that will be equivalent to the actual retail costs of the 
utility (which will be unbundled from the distribution rates).  Once this 
occurs, SCE will not be able to avoid the adder, even for industrial 
customers.  I think the folks at the utility are over-promising on something 
they won't be able to deliver once the CPUC issues its order in the retail 
adder proceeding.",,,EGA SCE CPUC
198,"Jeff,

Attached is a file that contains an analysis that Bob Badeer asked me to do 
for you.  The results are displayed on the ""graphs"" page in two graphs:

1. This (top) graph shows a typical portfolio that the utility might want to 
use to cover its short position.  I have displayed here a representative 
average monthly peak load shape for the year (it is acutally the CAISO avg 
peak load for the previous 12 months).  We have assumed that the utility has 
available 15GW of capacity (""utility-owned resources""), and that the 
remainder will be served through one of four types of contracts: a 10-yr 
fixed price, a 5-year fixed price, a 1-yr fixed price, or ""monthly"" prices 
(i.e., spot or balance of the month type prices).  We have then allocated the 
net short position among these four contracts in varying amounts, assuming 
that the utility would not want to be over-exposed to any one term.

2.  This (bottom) graph shows peak prices (using an average of NP and SP) for 
the next five years (1) for the four contracts listed above (""Monthly"" is 
simply our forward curve) and (2) for a weighted average price assuming the 
allocation shown in the first graph.  We note that we have assumed a cost to 
generate for the utility's resources of $40/Mwh.

Hope this is somewhat clear.  If you have any questions, please call me at

205,"Today's hearing was dominated by :
1) many lawyers arguing over whether the Commission must declare that the 
""rate freeze"" is over before raising rates, or whether the Commission can 
rely on its general constitutional and statutory authority to raise rates on 
an interim basis, without addressing the issue of the rate freeze, and, 
1) an appearance by Ralph Nader.

The Legal Issue
In general, our proposal seems to have gotten some traction.  Whether it 
sticks remains to be seen, however.  We proposed that:

The Commission has the authority to raise rates without addressing the rate 
freeze issue.
The Commission will not have the facts it needs, and it won't have  provided 
the due process necessary by Jan 4th, to address all the complex issues tied 
to the rate freeze.  And if it tries, it's likely to face a flurry of law 
suits, which is in no one's best interest.
For it's Jan 4th decision, the Commission should confine itself to 
determining whether, and if so by how much, to raise rates to maintain the 
utilities' access to capital markets. (We've taken no position on whether 
there's a need to raise rates.)
setting a hearing schedule to examine the ""rate freeze"" and all related 
issues thoroughly and methodically.

The utilities argued that the Commission must declare an end to the rate 
freeze; otherwise any Commission decision to raise rates would be easy to 
attack in the courts.  (In reality, the utilities want the Commission to end 
the rate freeze in order to assure lenders that the Commission will permit 
the utilities to recover going-forward procurement costs.  Under the rate 
freeze, the utility is at risk for procurement costs that exceed the rate 
freeze.)

In his presentation, our outside counsel offered numerous citations to past 
Commission decision and court cases supporting the Commission's ability to 
raise rates if it found it necessary to do so.  Many other parties agreed 
with our position.  A few parties said that the issue was too murky to make a 
call.  During questioning, both the President of the Commission (Loretta 
Lynch) and the presiding judge seemed to indicate that they believe the 
Commission has ample authority to raise rates without having to address the 
rate freeze issues. 

The Ralph Factor
Apparently, having lost the Presidential election, Ralph Nader's still 
looking for work.  He showed up at the hearings today and held a very lengthy 
news conference.  From what I could hear, he targeted all of his criticism at 
the utilities for being greedy, and at the Governor for being too ready and 
willing to bail the utilities out.  Even when thrown some soft balls about 
""out of state generators,"" Nader stuck to bashing the Governor and the 
utilities.  But I couldn't hear the entire press conference, so he may have 
said things that I missed.

The Next Steps
The hearings that were scheduled to end today will now go into next week. 
Tomorrow, the utilities are scheduled to make their case for financial 
hardship.  Customers intend to question the utilities very aggressively (as 
does the PUC).  The utilities will also have the chance to question the 
consumer representatives who filed their own proposals and analysis with the 
Commission.
On Tuesday, the Commission is likely to take up the issue of how big any rate 
increase needs to be and how much of the increase each customer group should 
shoulder. 

More tomorrow on the call.

Best,
Jeff

ALTERNATIVE REGULATION
IDAHO
Qwest proposes price cap plan

Qwest Corp. has proposed a bill to authorize incumbent local exchange
carriers (ILECs) to elect price cap regulation.  HB 96 would allow
companies to cap their prices for residential and small business
customers and charge prices that were less than the capped rates.

Under the bill, the Public Utilities Commission would need to set a
price floor only if it were requested by a non-ILEC.

HB 96 also would allow the ILEC petition the PUC to realign the basic
local exchange service prices between residential and small business
customers within the wire center, on a revenue-neutral basis.  If the
PUC approved the price realignment plan, the maximum basic local
exchange rate for each affected class of service would be adjusted to
reflect the new plan.

An AT&T Corp. spokeswoman told TR that AT&T had concerns about the fact
that the capped rates could be reduced in certain areas.  The
spokeswoman explained that this provision could act as an impediment for
competitors because the prices set for unbundled network elements are
set on a statewide average.  The spokeswoman said this would cause a
disparity between wholesale and retail prices.

HB 96, which was sponsored by the House State Affairs Committee, awaits
consideration by that committee.



UNIVERSAL SERVICE
WYOMING
Senate committee to take up bill expanding USF to cover wireless
carriers

The Senate Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee
is considering a bill to expand the state universal service fund (USF)
to cover wireless carriers.  (1/3/01 a.m.)  HB 52 would authorize the
Public Service Commission to determine how much USF money would be
available to the wireless carriers.

The bill would provide USF funds to wireless carriers that (1) provide
unlimited local calling for an entire local exchange area for a flat
fee, (2) offer credits for the amount of the distributions the company
receives from the USF on customers' bills, and (3) offer and advertise
all supported services throughout the local exchange area.  The
commission would have to adopt rules by Dec. 31 to define any additional
criteria carriers would have to meet.

The bill would authorize the commission to grant a company additional
time to complete the network upgrades needed to provide (1) single-party
service, (2) access to E911 service, or (3) toll limitation.  If the
commission decides to grant a company additional time, the otherwise
eligible company would be permitted to receive universal service support
for a period designated by the commission.

Under HB 52, the PSC could authorize a request only upon finding that
""exceptional circumstances"" prevented the company from providing those
three services.  The period the company could receive the support
without providing the specified services would extend only as long as
the commission finds that exceptional circumstances exist, the bill
said.

PENNSYLVANIA
RCN frustrated by another delay at Philadelphia city council

An RCN Corp. spokesperson told TR the company is losing patience after
two years of trying to win approval to lay fiber optic cable in
Philadelphia.  Last week the city council's public property committee
held a second hearing but failed to vote on the matter.  RCN's
application has been before the committee since last fall.  (11/17/00
p.m.)  The committee has decided to take it up again Feb. 26.

Some committee members are concerned that the company initially plans to
provide service only in certain parts of the city.  But RCN feels it has
a sound strategy, and plans to continue expanding once its operations
are up and running, the spokesperson said.

RCN began the application process in 1998.  The slow pace of the
council's consideration isn't surprising, a council spokesperson said,
considering that incumbent cable TV operator Comcast Corp.'s
headquarters are located in Philadelphia.

MAINE
PUC lays groundwork for number reclamation

The Public Utilities Commission has established procedures to reclaim
numbering resources that have been assigned to carriers but remain
unused.  Carriers will have to file standard ""part 4"" certifications
with North American Numbering Plan administrator NeuStar, Inc.  The
certifications will disclose the carriers' usage of assigned numbers and
whether there are numbers available for reclamation.

The PUC also set procedures for carriers to request extensions of the
time to activate allotted numbers before they must be returned.  The
commission's order is available at

Senate committee reviews bill to prohibit 'spam'

The Senate Committee on Economic Development, Technology, and Aerospace
is considering a measure to prohibit the transmission of unsolicited
e-mail advertisements.  Under SB 8, the recipient of an e-mail
advertisement transmitted in violation of the legislation could bring a
civil action against the violator.  The recipient could recover actual

Senator wants DPS to look into access to advanced services in rural
areas

Sen. James W. Wright (R., District 46) has introduced SB 1087 to direct
the Department of Public Service to evaluate rural customers' access to
advanced telecom services at reasonable rates.

The bill finds that rural communities often don't have access to
advanced services, resulting in limited opportunities to attract and
maintain businesses and readily access education, health care, and
recreational services.  The measure has been referred to Energy and
Telecommunications Committee.



WIRELESS
TENNESSEE
Lawmakers seek consumer protections in wireless contracts

Rep. Gary Odom (D., District 55) has introduced a bill that would
require wireless providers to notify consumers 30 days before any
written contract expired.  HB 499 would allow the notification to be
sent in a separate mailing or as part of the consumer's monthly
statement.  Providers that failed to notify consumers would be required
to offer six months of free service after the contract expired.  The
bill's text is available at
http://www.legislature.state.tn.us/bills/currentga/BILL/HB0499.pdf.

Sen. Ward Crutchfield (D., District) 10 has introduced a similar bill in

WIRELESS
TENNESSEE
Sen. Cohen aims to prevent novice drivers from using wireless phones

Sen. Stephen I. Cohen (D., District 30) has introduced two bills
designed to stop inexperienced drivers from using wireless phones while
operating vehicles.  SB 9 and SB 10 have been referred to the Senate
Committee on Transportation.

SB 9 would prohibit a driver with an intermediate driver's license or
learner's permit from using a wireless phone while driving.  Violators
would be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor and subject to a $100 fine.  In
addition, they would have to wait 90 days beyond the time when they
otherwise would have been eligible to apply for an intermediate or
unrestricted license.  SB 9 would make an exception for restricted
drivers who used wireless phones in legitimate emergency situations.
Its text is available at
http://www.legislature.state.tn.us/bills/currentga/BILL/SB0009.pdf.

SB 10 would apply similar rules to drivers under the age of 18 but
wouldn't include SB 9's rule about postponing eligibility for the next
type of license.  SB 10's text is available at

WASHINGTON
WUTC sets hearing on 'overlay' public information plan cost recovery

The Utilities and Transportation Commission has scheduled a Feb. 23
hearing to address the most appropriate method for allocating the costs
of a $1.2 million public education plan relating to the introduction of
10-digit dialing and the ""564"" area code ""overlay"" in Western
Washington.  Comments are due Feb. 16.

The staff has proposed basing the amount each provider must pay on the
number of prefixes assigned to each provider, as reported by North
American Number Planning administrator NeuStar, Inc.  Other plans being
considered would base the allocation on the number of working telephone
numbers, access lines in service, and revenues.

The staff said it preferred the prefix method because it relies on
verified, publicly available, nonconfidential information.  The staff
also pointed out that the demand for prefixes is the ""most direct cause
of the need for area code relief.""  The staff is recommending an
assessment of about $568 per prefix.

The commission also requested comments by Feb. 16 on a mechanism for
collecting and distributing money for the public education plan.  The
Washington Independent Telephone Association has offered to play this
role.  The association would receive payments from each provider and
would use the fund to pay for the advertising costs detailed in the
plan.  The WUTC approved the plan in November 2000.  (Docket no.

""on records of the seller maintained in the ordinary course of
business.""  The existing exemption applies only to services that are
listed separately on the customer's bill.  HB 594's text is available at

PISMO BEACH, Calif., Sept. 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Utilagent, a California based 
utility services company, announced that it now provides a 20% electricity 
savings for all PG&E, Edison, and SDG&E residential accounts throughout 
California. The savings come directly from the actual cost of the electricity 
and is deducted from the ""electric energy"" charges as shown on one's utility 
bill. 
""California residents have seen their electricity bills skyrocket instead of 
decline and view this deregulation process as a confusing, dismal failure"", 
says Robert Kramb, manager of Utilagent. ""In addition, except for microscopic 
print found on electricity bills, regarding alternative suppliers, little has 
been done by the Public Utilities Commission and utility companies to educate 
Californian's about their purchase options. Utilagent has simply decided to 
take the guesswork out of the process."" 
?


Utilagent provides Californian's with an on-line approach for the 20% 
savings. Their web site http://www.electricityderegulation.com uses a 
one-page, one-minute, sign-up form where a resident enters their utility 
information and payment option. The entire process is done on-line, and there 
are no fees (either switching or cancellation), no deposits, and no long-term 
contracts. 
""Utilagent scours the utility market place for the best programs that provide 
the best utility savings for the most people, and we are pleased to promote 
Utility.com as the ESP (electric service provider) in California. Those 
signing up through Utilagent receive their same electricity and utility 
services as they have in the past, but pay 20% less for their electric 
energy, the way electricity deregulation is meant to be"", claims Kramb.

Stocks were poised to open flat to lower in the absence of any 
significant economic news until mid-week, amid primarily 
cautious earnings news. Earnings season resumes this week as 
roughly 160 of the S&P 500 companies will report, according to 
First Call.

Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing (MMM,102) reported 3Q operating 
earnings of $1.10 per share, $0.01 higher than the First Call 
mean estimate as global sales declined 7%. The Dow component 
said profits fell 12.4% from the year ago period mainly due to a 
slowing U.S. economy. Going forward, 3M lowered its 4Q earnings 
guidance to a range of $0.95-$1.05 per share, versus its 
previous $1.05 forecast.

Wireless, data communications and phone service provider SBC 
Communications (SBC,44,f2) posted 3Q profits, excluding items, 
of $0.59 per share, $0.01 below the First Call consensus 
estimate as business conditions worsened in recent months. The 
Dow component plans to cut capital expenditures by 20% in 2002 
and eliminate several thousand jobs as it attempts to achieve 
""meaningful growth in 2002.""

Dell Computer (DELL,24,f1) and EMC Corp. (EMC,11.51,f2) 
announced a five-year alliance aimed at growing both companies' 
storage system segments. The companies have agreed to co-market

view that gives us a better argument that there was no notice for exit fees.
I also think we may be better off litigating the question under ABX1.  Can't
recall which section now, but the deal provides that the relationship is
between CDWR and the end user.  And the end user has a legal obligation to
pay for it upon ""DELIVERY"".  If it's never delivered, the law does not
impose an obligation.  And, I would argue, if the legislature had wanted to

they could have.  Now, that may not hold water in next session, but at least

223,"UPDATE 2 - Calif. Gov. set to sign bill to cut power rates
(UPDATE: Changes lead to add comments from Gov. Davis spokesman)
By Nigel Hunt 
LOS ANGELES, Aug 31 (Reuters) - California Gov. Gray Davis will sign 
emergency legislation to cut electricity rates in San Diego where a tripling 
in customers' bills this summer has sparked a public outcry, his spokesman 
said on Thursday. 
The bill was passed by the California Assembly by 58 votes to 14 late 
Wednesday. It needed 54 votes to secure the necessary two-thirds majority of 
the Assembly's 80 members required for emergency legislation. 
``He is in favour of the Alpert/Davis bill. If he gets the bill next week I 
suspect he will sign it sooner rather than later,'' said Davis' spokesman 
Steven Maviglio, noting however that he was reserving judgment on a linked 
measure to provide up to $150 million in state funds to help fund the price 
cut. 
The bill was passed by the state Senate on Tuesday. It is sponsored San Diego 
Democrats state Sen. Dede Alpert and Assemblywoman Susan Davis. 
Under rules governing the deregulation of California's power industry, 
customers of Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE - news) unit San Diego Gas and Electric 
are the first to pay free market rates without a safety net. 
When California deregulated its power markets, rates were initially frozen 
for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities. The rate freeze 
was lifted for San Diego Gas and Electric customers last year. 
Rates for the state's other two investor-owned utilities, San Francisco-based 
PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG - news) subsidiary Pacific Gas and Electric and 
Rosemead-based Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news) unit Southern 
California Edison, remain frozen. 
The proposed legislation establishes a 6.5 cent per kilowatt hour cap on the 
cost of energy for ratepayers, less than a third of the the current ``free 
market'' cost of 20.8 cents. The cap would be retroactive to June 1, 2000. 
Under the bill, the difference between rates paid by customers and the higher 
market-based rates would initially be footed by the local utility, San Diego 
Gas and Electric, which would create a ``balancing account.'' The shortfall 
would then be recouped from customers at a later date. 
San Diego Gas and Electric spokesman Doug Kline said the utility was urging 
Davis to veto the legislation. 
``It is a well intentioned, but seriously flawed bill. It is like ordering a 
shopkeeper to buy a loaf of bread for $2 and sell it to customers for 60 
cents,'' he said. 
The bill would cap prices through December 31, 2002 although the rate ceiling 
could be extended through December 2003 if the California Public Utilities 
Commission (CPUC) finds that it is in the public interest. 
Kline said the utility has estimated the under-collected shortfall would 
amount to around $726 million by the end of 2002. If it were extended for 
another year that shortfall would climb to around $1 billion, he noted. 
He said the bill, if approved, would impact the utility's credit ratings. 
Wholesale prices in the state soared to record levels this summer and as San 
Diego residents saw their bills skyrocket. There were reports that some 
pensioners were even turning off their refrigerators in a bid to keep their 
power costs down. 
The CPUC, which regulates the state's power markets, held an emergency 
meeting last week and voted for a partial cap which limited bills for 
customers for their first 500 kilowatt hours per month of use. 
But a plan for more extensive relief along similar lines to the Davis/Alpert 
bill was defeated in a vote that split along political lines. 
It has been estimated that the plan approved by the CPUC would result in a 
much smaller shortfall of about $77 million. 
The three commissioners who were appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson, a 
Republican, backed the more modest relief plan, while the two appointees of 
Davis, the current Democratic governor, sought more extensive rate cuts. 
California's power problems are caused partly by increased demand linked to 
the nation's booming economy, with Western states among those showing the 
fastest growth. 
There also have been few power plants built during the past 10 years and, 
although many are now planned, the prolonged approval and construction 
process means most will not come on line before 2002.

225,"Dear Evening MBA Students,

This is the second announcement regarding our plans for the EMBA Seminar in
International Business. Much of this message is a repeat of the initial
one. But some points have been added.

NEW MATERIAL

1. As of today (December 7) we have received 30 deposits from interested
students. Should you be interested in participating and have not yet
applied, please do so as soon as possible, but in any case before the
December 15 deadline.

2. Regarding the possibility of visiting Cuba, some of you have asked about
the legality of this. Please note that I have a license from the US Dept.
of the Treasury that permits me to send students enrolled in a legitimate
course, for credit, to Cuba under certain conditions.

3. The current political situation in Indonesia is uncertain. However, my
sources there indicate that it should be OK for us to visit there if we
decide to do so. But, if the situation worsens we would alter the itinerary.

4. Some applications have been submitted without a preference for
destination. YOU MUST indicate your priority. You can rank all three
destinations if you wish, but you must indicate, at a minimum, your
priority for program A or B. Should you not be selected for your first
choice you will be transferred to the appropriate priority pool of your
second choice.

REPEAT

For those of you unfamiliar with this course, please see
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/HaasGlobal/NGcourseoutline.htm for the
2000 version that looked at Ghana, Belgium and the Netherlands or
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/HaasGlobal/JVcourseoutline.htm for the
1999 version that included Japan and Vietnam.

For 2001 we are going to try something slightly different. We will have two
distinct programs - one will be a repeat of last year's and the other will
venture into new territory. The details are as follows. Please note that
everything mentioned below is still tentative and subject to change or
cancellation.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS

Both programs will commence with a series of classes, at Haas, in June.

Program A, led by Diane Dimeff will retrace the itinerary of the 2000
program to Ghana, the Netherlands and Belgium. The approximate dates for
the travel portion will be Saturday, July 7 through Saturday, July 21.

Program B, led by Sebastian Teunissen will consist of one of two possible
itineraries, depending on student demand:

itinerary 1: Cuba, Panama and Venezuela (or Costa Rica.)
itinerary 2: Australia and Indonesia.

Travel for program B will also start on approximately July 7 and end on
approximately July 21.

Costs for the programs are expected to be approximately equal to those
charged in previous years ($4,600), with the exception of the
Australia/Indonesia option. If this program is selected the final cost is
likely to be roughly $1,000 higher due to increased air fares. Final costs
will be determined once itineraries are set.

As you can see, planning is still in the early stages. But, before we go
much farther we need to know who is interested in participating. So, we
need to receive expressions of interest, in the form of a refundable $100
deposit from interested students.

APPLICATION PRIORITIES

Students will have different priorities depending on seniority. Priorities
are as follows:

Top Priority - both programs - students in fourth semester or higher in
January 2001 who HAVE NOT participated in the program in a previous year.

Second Priority - Program B only - students in fourth semester or higher
who did participate in the program in a previous year. These students are
not eligible for program A.

Lowest Priority - both programs - students in second or third semester.

Each group is limited to a maximum of 15 students.

APPLICATION PROCEDURE

Please submit, to the Evening MBA office, a check in the sum of $100
payable to UC Regents together with the following information, no later
than December 15, 2000.
- Name
- Semester level as of January 2001
- Whether or not you have previously participated in the program
- Choice of program: A or B (If you choose program B please also indicate
your preferred destination: Latin America or Australia/Indonesia.)
- e-mail address

Once we have a clear indication of preferences the final details will be
planned and announced. The announcement will likely be made in January. At
that time you will be advised of the program for which you are eligible.
You will then be asked to increase your deposit by $900 and the entire
$1,000 deposit becomes non-refundable.

OTHER ISSUES

Please check your passport to ensure that it expires no earlier than
December 31, 2001. If it does please renew it now. Passports with shorter
expirations may be rejected for visas, depending on the countries to which
you will travel.

Also, please check the visa requirements for the countries of interest for
your particular nationality. This may have a bearing on the program that
you select.

One of our business organization partners, PIBA, will be conducting its own
Energy Conference this Thursday, May 3.  While we will be holding an Energy
Summit on Friday at Synopsys, I want to continue to keep you apprised of all
opportunities to provide tools to get through this crisis.  So, especially
for anyone who cannot attend SVMG's Summit on Friday, please note the
details below for PIBAS's summit.

Best Wishes,

Carl


On May 3, 2001 the PIBA Environmental Product Strategies Committee and the
Environmental Action Committee are hosting a joint meeting from 8:00am-12pm
- Hewlett Packard, 3215 Porter Drive, Palo Alto, Bldg. 15, ""Insead"" Room.
Directions available at PIBA.org web site

CHAIRS: Christine Kohl-Zaugg, CH2M Hill; and Ed Quevedo, WSP Environmental
North America; Jenny Portera,
 EORM; and Ron Vitug, Turner Construction
 BD.LIAISON:     Greg Chambers, Quantum Corporation
 TOPIC:              Power For the Valley: Energy Management Risks and
Solutions
 SPEAKERS:     Lynne Jimenez, KGO-Radio; Ken Perkins, Shaklee; Bob
Thurmand, Cisco Systems; Mary Tucker, City of San Jose; and Bill Smith,
EPRI.

? REGISTRATION will be held from 7:30-7:50am.  The meeting will start at
8:00am.
? NON MEMBER CHARGE: $95.00 (Cash, Check, or Visa/MC) 50% discount to SVMG
members.

As the California energy crisis has deepened, organizations of all kinds
are struggling to keep ahead of energy management operating and planning
risks.  This 
 day workshop will focus on Successes and Failures of the
current energy management infrastructure, and will deliver some best
practices and practical planning solutions which organizations can employ
today to improve their energy management strategies.  Unlike other sessions
and conferences on this important topic, our session will be
practice-based, deliver usable tools, and provide you with a chance to put
your questions directly to experts and colleagues who have dealt with the
challenges of the Energy Shortage on the front lines.

We will open with an interactive session on energy sources, selection, and
""how we got here.""  We expect this session will be led by Lynne Jimenez of
KGO-Radio.

We will then have a one-hour session on Best Practices in designing
buildings to avoid energy crises.  This discussion will include Ken Perkins
of Shaklee, and a second private sector building operator.

Our third session will focus on Breakdowns in the permitting and energy
sourcing and approval process, with Bob Thurmond from Cisco Systems and
Mary Tucker from the City of San Jose.

We will close with a roundtable discussion of Solutions and the Road
Forward, to include representatives of the City of Santa Clara, the League
of Women Voters, and Bill Smith from EPRI.  Ms. Jimenez will facilitate
this closing session.

232,"Senator Richard Alarcon held a select committee hearing today on
implementation of SB 115 (Solis) related to an environmental justice policy
for the state.  Most of the hearing was devoted to testimony from the Office
of Planning and Research, CalEPA, the Air Resources Board, and others.
There was, however, a very interesting exchange between Senator Alarcon and
CEC Commissioner Bob Laurie.

AB 970 includes a provision indicating that projects subject to the six
month siting process must comply with ""all regulations adopted by the
commission that ensure that an application addressees disproportionate
impacts in a manner consistent"" with environmental justice direction to the
Governor's Office of Planning and Research contained in Government Code
Section 65040.12.

During today's hearing, Senator Alarcon indicated that he believes that AB
970 requires compliance with federal environmental justice guidelines before
a power plant can be sited.  Senator Alarcon argues further that the CEC
must adopt regulations to implement the federal environmental justice
guidelines in order to implement the expedited power plant siting process.
He also indicated today in his hearing that AB 970 goes far beyond SB 1622,
which would have required the CEC to adopt environmental justice
regulations, and was defeated earlier this year.

The CEC (Commissioner Bob Laurie) responded that AB 970 provides for a
six-month process for a negative declaration of environmental impacts,
including environmental justice matters.  According to the CEC, the
environmental justice issue must be addressed in regulations implementing
the 6-month process but that the CEC is cautious about moving ahead of the
OPR process.  That's because the OPR process will apply to all agencies,
including the CEC.  As a result, the CEC must implement environmental
justice policies in a conservative fashion.

In an exchange with Commissioner Laurie, Senator Alarcon conceded that the
CEC could not move too far ahead of everyone else.  At the same time, he
indicated that he believes that the CEC's work will become a model for other
agency action.

I am Organizing a Panel at the IEEE Summer Meeting in Vancouver July 15-19

239,"   CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOCUMENT
   PER CPUC RULE 51

ALL PARTIES:

Based on feedback from a number of parties, we have decided to postpone next
week's Gas Accord II Workshop.  The Workshops previously scheduled for
January 10-11, 2001, and January 24-25, 2001, will not be held.

We tentatively plan on holding the next Workshops on February 7-8, and
February 21-22, 2001.  We request that you pencil in these dates on your
calendars.  We will confirm these dates later, hopefully by next week, once
we learn the procedural schedule for the ongoing Rate Stabilization hearings
before the CPUC.

The Gas Accord II Workshop on February 7-8 (tentative dates) will be
informational in nature, and will focus on reviewing and explaining PG&E's
comprehensive Gas Accord II Settlement Proposal, which was distributed by
e-mail on December 21, 2000.  We then propose to use the following Workshop,
scheduled for February 21-22 (tentative dates), to receive specific feedback
from parties, and engage in detailed, substantive discussions.

Attached below is a revised schedule for suggested workshop dates and
timing, beginning with the tentative February 7-8 Informational Workshop.

We continue to believe that PG&E must be in a position file an application
with the Commission - either a settlement or PG&E's litigation case - no
later than the middle of this calendar year.  The mid-year filing date is
necessary in order to allow sufficient time for the Commission to consider
the issues and render a decision, and for PG&E to implement the decision by
December 31, 2002, which is the date the current Gas Accord, OFO and Gas OII
settlements effectively end.

Between now and the upcoming February Workshops, we encourage Parties to
continue to review the December 21 Settlement Proposal, and to contact us
with any questions and concerns.  PG&E representatives also will be
available to meet with Parties individually, or in small groups, to go over
the Settlement Proposal in detail, prior to the February Workshops.  The
purpose of such smaller sessions will not be to negotiate any details, but
only to explain the PG&E Settlement Proposal, and respond to questions.
Please feel free to contact either of us, and we can make the necessary
arrangements for such a meeting.

We appreciate all the input various parties have provided regarding the
scheduling issues, and we hope this revised schedule is responsive to your
concerns.

280,"I did not.  This is the first notice I have had of this matter.  Jim


From: Rob Walls on 11/30/2000 10:08 AM
",Rob Walls,,
281," The very first time that I laid eyes on  Steve Susman , he was clad only in 
his underwear.  Moreover, he was  shouting  and angrily brandishing his fist 
at me!  The Northern Lights may have seen stranger sights, but I assure you I 
have not.

 In 1968 or 1969 (you will understand that I have repressed the actual date), 
I journeyed to Fort Worth, Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review 
to attend some State Bar of Texas committee meeting, one being held, I think, 
in conjunction with an annual meeting of the Bar.  The Law Review had 
reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels.  I arrived late at 
night,  dutifully registered at the hotel's desk, received my room  key,  
took the elevator to the designated floor, walked to my room, inserted the 
room key, and opened the door.  The darkness that shrouded the room was 
suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a 
bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very 
large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why I had 
violated the sanctity of his room!  

 It will surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was  
adamantly insisting  on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough 
for me to offer him one.  Knowing even at my then tender young age a madman 
when I see one, I exited  the scene of the controversy with as much speed as 
my terrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale 
of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury.  There may well have 
been some talk of calling hotel security or the Fort Worth Police, but in the 
end I settled for a new room, the door of which I bolted immediately. 

 After a mostly sleepless night during which I anticipated the imminent 
reappearance of the madman, I arose, showered,  dressed, and carefully made 
my way to the meeting room.  During the course of the day, I spotted the 
madman across the ballroom engaged in conversation with another individual.  
Surreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends, I asked if he knew 
him.  The answer was no, but he did know who he was.  ""The name is Susman, my 
man, Steve Susman"".  I immediately resolved that my path and that of  
""Susman, my man, Steve Susman"" would never again cross.  

 Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.  How could I have possibly foreseen 
as I fled from the madman in  that Forth Worth hotel room so many years ago 
that not only would my path again cross his but that I would one day serve as 
his lawyer, that  he  would serve as mine,  and that I would count him  as 
one of my closest friends!  I hereby officially  forgive you, Steve, not only 
for stealing my  Fort Worth hotel room but also  for the injury you wished on 
me that night.  Looking back on it, I wouldn't want it to have been  any 
other way.

 I wish you the Happiest of Birthdays, Steve.  Thanks for your friendship--I 
treasure it. 

 All the best, 

 Jim

That is cool. I can't really change the trip but I am sure I will be back in Vancouver soon. Send me your vitals and I'll let you know the next time I am in town. Or give me shout if you are ever out in Calgary. Do you have Atkinson's office phone number? I seem to have misplaced it.

Patrick Jeffers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 12/27/01
Janikowski (groin) has been kicking in practice. He is expected to play this week. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season. Walter Rasby will continue to start in his place, but Zeron Flemister has emerged as the team's best receiving tight end with Alexander out. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/27/01
The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over. Mike Holmgren said he would only use him in an emergency this week, and the Seahawks coach may elect to have Hasselbeck use the season's final two games to rest his injured shoulder. Trent Dilfer will start at San Diego this week. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=133462&> , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Zereoue missed practice on Wednesday with a shoulder injury. He is listed as probable for this week. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Bouman practiced without pads on Wednesday. If he cannot practice fully on Thursday, Spergon Wynn will get the start this week.

McKnight is listed as questionable with an ankle injury. He practiced and is hopeful of playing this week. 

Travis Minor <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=235123&>, RB MIA - Giggles Updated 12/27/01
The Miami Herald reports Minor will get more work on offense this week. Lamar Smith will remain the starter, but the Dolphins are hoping Minor can inject some life into the offense. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/27/01
The Detroit Free Press says Stewart is not expected to play this week because of a sprained ankle. Lamont Warren and Cory Schlesinger will assume most of the workload in his place. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
The Detroit Free Press says McMahon is not expected to practice or play this week. Ty Detmer will start in his place. 

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/27/01
Griese told the Denver Post he is ready to take on the Broncos, although Mike Shanahan questioned how effective he would be in his return. ""How do you know with a concussion?"" Shanahan said. ""There should be no side effects. Hopefully there's not. But we have learned a lot through the years about concussions and how serious the! y ! can be, and hopefully that's something in the past and they won't reoccur."" 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Shea is expected to miss the season's final two games with a shoulder injury. O.J. Santiago should remain in the starting lineup in Shea's place. 

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Smith underwent surgery on his left hamstring. He is expected to be ready for training camp next season and will compete for the starting job. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Walls is listed as questionable with a knee injury. He was expected to be evaluated again on Thursday. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/27/01
Muhammad (turf toe) is not expected to play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again. 

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/27/01
Henry will sit out again this week with a sprained knee. Shawn Bryson will start for the second consecutive week. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
McNair missed practice Wednesday because of back pain. ""I'm going to try to do some things tomorrow and hope it loosens up and not have as much pain as I had today,"" McNair said. ""I'm not going to go out and try to force the issue. If it's still sore and still tight where I can't have all my mechanics right, I'm not going to force the issue."" The Titans listed him as questionable yet again Wednesday, but McNair likely will play 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/27/01
Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice, and indicated he might not play in the regular season's final two games. ""You want to take care of the injury first and if that means not playing, that means not playing,"" Bettis told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""But you want to make sure you're healed up. The team playing as well as it has played allows me the opportunity to get healthy. I'm using it very, very wisely."" 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Gramatica sat out practice Wednesday, but is expected to test his injured leg on Thursday. Doug Brien and Brad Daluiso worked out Wednesday for the Buccaneers, who might sign one if Martin Gramatica can't kick against the Baltimore Ravens this week. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/26/01
Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose separated left shoulder is too sore for him to play. Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday. ""There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore,"" Holmgren said. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/26/01
Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His status for this week's game is unclear. 

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Graham may miss his second consecutive game this week because of the death of his father. With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have to start again. 

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12436&> , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular workload once again. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/26/01
Smith is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Peter Warrick <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Giggles Updated 12/26/01
Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if needed.

Latest NFL Player News

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/30/01
Gadsden (hamstring) started Sunday's game against Atlanta. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/30/01
Muhammad (toe) has been deactivated for Sunday's game. Isaac Byrd will start in his place. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/30/01
Walls (knee) has been declared inactive for Sunday's game. Kris Mangum will start in his place. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/30/01
Bouman has been deactivated for Sunday's game. Spergon Wynn will start in his place. 

Dez White <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/30/01
White has been declared inactive for Sunday's game. David Terrell is expected to start in his place. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/30/01
Stewart has been deactivated for Sunday's game. Lamont Warren will start in his place. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/30/01
McMahon will not play on Sunday. Ty Detmer will start in his place. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/30/01
Bettis has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will start in his place. 

Jay Fiedler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 12/29/01
Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start. If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start. 

Larry Foster <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season. 

Bert Emanuel <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1186&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/29/01
Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again. 

Seahawks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place. 

Spergon Wynn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=187690&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. 

Drew Bledsoe <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/28/01
Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.

RE:     Jackson Prairie Storage Balance 

Effective November 15, 2001, and continuing through the winter heating season, 
Northwest Pipeline will begin posting on the WWW.1Line.Williams.com Daily Operational 
Report (DOR) its Jackson Prairie storage account activity.  The status of the JP account 
will be based on activity at the close of the previous gas day.  This information should 
keep customers apprised of the account inventory, whether it is increasing or decreasing, 
and whether an entitlement or operational flow order is approaching based on a weak 
storage level coupled with overscheduled volumes through the Kemmerer Compressor.  
Below is an example of how the information will be displayed. 

Jackson Prairie storage balance - Gas Day November 14, 2001. 

*Above 1,000,000 MDth           Increasing              Decreasing              Stable

291,"I have a request from the ENA settlements group.  Williams Energy is billing 
the HPL purchase deals on the ENA invoice.  The accountant at Williams says, 
that by the request of the HPL trader, the deals are to be billed to ENA.  We 
would like to have the Texas deals billed directly to HPL.  If you do not 
have a problem with this, can you ask your counterpart at Williams to split 
the deals between HPL and ENA?  It would make the payment process much easier.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

We have an ongoing issue every month between what we nominate from GEPL into HGPL and on to King Ranch (flows into HGPL at meter 8284) and what is in the system as purchase gas upstream of the meter.  The volume has been anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000/Day over the nomination for at least the past six months.  Would you please fax the meter statements from GEPL for February so that I can try to determine which meters are flowing over what is nominated and verify that we have deals in the system for each offsystem meter.

338,"I agree with you that par. 4 doesn't give NMNG anything beyond what the 
tariff and general contract law gave them.  The ""subject to agreement by 
Transwestern"" language is redundant since the previous clause says "" by 
mutual written agreement.""  Additionally, its confusing and innacurate 
because the ""provided, however, that"" clause isn't even binding if we 
mutually agree to eliminate it.   I therefore think we ought to take par. 4 
out, or at least remove the ""provided however"" clause.  I don't agree that we 
can only decrease their MDQ by using capacity release.  We can mutually agree 
to terminate their contract or reduce their MDQ without using cap. release.  
I suppose we would need to use cap. release if the termination or reduction 
of their MDQ was a sham designed to get the capacity from NMNG to another 
shipper, however. 

I would propose one change to Par. 3 just to make the discount more clear.  
The par. talks about primary delivery points but is silent on primary 
receipts.  I'd add this, after the words ""Appendix A"" at the end of the 
current first sentence:

""and receipts at the primary points of receipt set forth on Appendix A.  The 
discounted rate shall also apply to receipts at alternate receipt points in 
Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) area.""

I'm a fan of being extremely clear when we limit availability of discounts, 
and think we should always fully explain what the discount applies to at both 
the receipt and delivery end of the deal.  

Susan, please work with Christine to get these changes made.  I'd like to 
eliminate par. 4 entirely, but I can live with it if the business people want 
to leave it in, as long as we eliminate the ""provided however"" clause.   With 
these changes, I'm OK with the contract.  Thanks.

353,"Hello All-

Attached above are the cover letter and proposed tariff sheets filed by Texas 
Eastern yesterday for a June 1 effective date.  The rate changes reflect 
under recoveries in their ASA account which tracks their cash-out mechanism 
and increased cost of system fuel.  The underrecovery in the ASA account has 
increased from $22,000 to over $22,000,000 over the period September 1--March 
31.  Texas Eastern claims that this is largely a result of the gaming of 
their currently monthly cash-out (which will likely be changed to weekly in 
their 637 proceeding).  As a result, Texas Eastern is seeking a waiver of the 
annual filing period in order to begin collecting the underrecovery through a 
surcharge that would amount to as much as $.0354 from ELA-M3.  Texas Eastern 
proposes to begin recovery in June so as to extend the recovery period from 
12 months (Dec-Nov) to 18 months (Jun-Nov), which will lower the level of the 
surcharge.

We'll review the filing to see if there are any grounds for protest / 
comment.  These types of dollars are usually ""rubber-stamped"" by FERC for 
pass-through but the filing to change the recovery time period may give us 
some grounds to protest the recovery.

 The full filing can be found at :

These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.

Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.

ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing and additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.



Chris's notes:
Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

Thanks for passing this message on -- it is good to know what is on the rumor mill, and nobody who knows what I do ever passes those on to me directly!

I believe that we should carefully stay away from any statement that cuts are based on mid-year PRC, as that would not be the best legal defense to have.   

Instead, HR, with assistance from legal, has put forth a matrix for businesses to use in determining which employees, if any, will be affected.  Listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality (which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors), ability to perform several different types of jobs, business knowledge, leadership, teamwork, and historical performance over the last 18 months.  PRC results would not be the sole factor.  Otherwise, someone who is the only person who knows how to do a mission-critical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at mid-year review.  That result obviously would be disasterous.

ISDA Unveils New Margin Accord For Collateral Process
Dow Jones - May 16, 2001
By Joe Niedzielski

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The International Swaps and Derivatives Association
said Wednesday that it has published new documentation on margin provisions.


The document, known as the 2001 ISDA margin provisions, updates and
simplifies ISDA'S four existing credit support documents in a single
document, ISDA said Wednesday in a press release.

""The document is easy to understand and will reduce the barriers to entry
for new derivatives market participants,"" Robert Pickel, ISDA's executive
director and CEO said in the release.

In many areas of the over-the-counter derivatives market, financial
institutions and other end users of derivatives , such as corporations and
fund managers, reduce credit exposure by posting cash collateral.

But unlike the highly-liquid and standardized U.S. government securities
repurchase market, where the transfer of collateral is generally initiated
by the close of business following a morning margin call, a derivatives
counterparty may have to wait as long as 10 days to two weeks before being
able to liquidate.

ISDA's new document, though, includes stepped-up timing standards for
collateral calls.

The provisions have common operational provisions, incorporate a plain
English approach and offer more streamlined timing and dispute-resolution
procedures, ISDA said.

Parties using the provisions can select jurisdiction-specific provisions to
apply to their margin arrangements under New York, English and Japanese law,
ISDA said.

The ISDA 2001 margin provisions documentation project was partially a
response to bouts of market turmoil in recent years. Several disputes have
arisen between market participants in the wake of 1998's liquidity seizure
and flight-to-quality following Russia's debt default and the near demise of
Long Term Capital Management, the heavily-leveraged hedge fund.

""The provisions were a response to market disruptions in recent years and
offer a mechanism to reduce credit exposure arising between the time of a
trade and the time at which an institution can liquidate any available
collateral,"" said David Maloy, managing director of global collateral and
margin at UBS Warburg and a co-chair of the ISDA collateral committee.

For institutions that want to amend their existing credit support annexes
rather than opt for the new margin provisions, amendment forms to the New
York law and English law credit support annexes will be available in June,
ISDA said.

ISDA said those forms will mirror the operative sections of the provisions
with respect to transfer timing, dispute resolution and substitutions or
exchange of margin.


IRS Officials at Hearing Question Need For Hedging Regulations Standard
BNA - May 17, 2001
By Alison Bennett

Internal Revenue Service and Treasury officials May 16 sharply questioned
witnesses on why they should broaden the risk standard used to define
hedging transactions in proposed rules (REG-107047-00) that have drawn
criticism from the practitioner community.

Nearly every hearing witness said the proposed rules do not go far enough in
implementing a new standard for hedging enacted under the Ticket to Work and
Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (Pub. L. No. 106-70).

That law changed the standard for qualifying hedging transactions from one
focusing on risk reduction transactions to one centered around risk
management transactions. Witnesses complained that the proposed rules (12
DTR G-10, L-25, 1/18/01) retained too great a focus on risk reduction as a
way to assess whether favorable hedging treatment should be allowed.

The rules represent ""a serious and inappropriate failure"" to live up to
congressional standards, said Andrea Kramer of McDermott, Will & Emery in
Chicago. ""I find it inconceivable that anybody could argue that the 1999 tax
act did not result in a far-reaching and substantive change to the meaning
of hedging transactions,"" Kramer said.

Questions From IRS

She was questioned closely by JoLynn Ricks, an IRS attorney-adviser on
financial institutions and products, about why the government should broaden
the standard to go beyond the position taken by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board on hedging in 1998, which focused on risk reduction.

Kramer contended that Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, which was
amended last June (118 DTR G-7, 6/19/00), is not relevant to tax questions
surrounding the hedging of derivatives. ""The financial accounting rules for
derivatives and hedging transactions are fundamentally different from the
tax rules,"" Kramer said. ""I would argue that FAS 133 is not significant
here.

In addition to urging the government to replace all mention of risk
reduction in the final rules with the standard of risk management, both
Kramer and Earl Goldhammer of American Electric Power asked for favorable
treatment for certain transactions by commodities dealers.

Commodities Proposal

Under the proposal raised by both witnesses, qualifying transactions would:

* relate to a derivative valued in reference to a commodity also
handled by the dealer;
* fall within pre-approved controls on speculation set out in formally
adopted risk management policies; and

* not be identified by the commodities dealer as having been entered
into in its dealer capacity.

""We would like to know that if a trader trades within preapproved limits,
and if you have a risk management program that is not a phony program, that
that is legitimate,"" Goldhammer said.

Although Goldhammer was identified on an IRS hearing document as working for
America's Energy Partners (95 DTR G-2, TaxCore, 5/16/01), he told IRS
officials that is merely his company's slogan.

Salomon Smith Barney Tax Director Mark Perwien, representing the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. in New York, also
criticized the references to risk reduction found under the proposed rules.

""It's very important for a company to be able to manage its price and all of
its other risks in a way that is consistent with how it sees the
marketplace,"" Perwien told the government panel.

The ISDA representative acknowledged that ""obviously, IRS is concerned about
being whipsawed,"" but said protections, such as same-day identification of
derivatives, already exist.

He stressed that, to properly implement congressional intent, the final
rules should apply to all transactions undertaken in the ordinary course of
business that alter the taxpayer's exposure to one or more of the risks
inherent in the taxpayer's core economic activities.

In addition, he said, favorable hedging treatment should be available for
weather and energy supply derivatives. IRS also should permit hedges of
dividend streams, overall profitability, and other business risks that do
not relate directly to interest rate or price changes or currency
fluctuations, Periwen told the government.

Gap Hedges Raised

Testifying on behalf of the American Council of Life Insurers, Washington,
D.C., Frank Gould of Prudential Life Insurance Co. urged IRS and Treasury to
provide favorable treatment of gap hedging of derivatives by his industry.

""IRS field agents are routinely concluding that gap hedges are not good tax
hedges--they're consistently saying they're hedges of capital assets,"" Gould
said.

""Gap hedging isn't about a particular asset or group of assets,"" he said.
""It's about maintaining balance between assets and liabilities. It's an
integral part of how we run our business.""

Peter Carlisle of Baker & McKenzie, Washington, D.C., and his colleague Jeff
Wallace, both said the IRS definition of risk management is ""inappropriately
restrictive.""

Wallace said that, because companies approach hedging in different ways, it
would be appropriate for IRS to be more flexible in what it considers
qualifying risk management activities.

Split Approach to Hedging?

For example, he said, some companies take a ""macroeconomic"" approach to
hedging, in which the entire enterprise faces economic risk, while others
take a ""microeconomic,"" or transaction-by-transaction approach to these
risks.
""Enterprise risk reduction is a nebulous concept which is really not
practicable for taxpayers who manage their risk on a microeconomic level,""
Wallace said.

Ricks asked if IRS should consider an approach which would allow taxpayers
to do both macroeconomic and microeconomic hedging, as long as they identify
which type they are doing, and allow that to control treatment of the
transaction. Both Carlisle and Wallace said they would heartily endorse such
an approach.

The government panel included two other officials from IRS financial
institutions and products, special counsel Richard Carlisle and branch chief
Alvin Kraft. Also on the panel were Viva Hammer, a Treasury
attorney-adviser, and Robert Hanson, Treasury deputy tax legislative counsel
for regulatory affairs.

The transcript of the hearing will be in BNA TaxCore.


Towards one interest rate
Business Standard - May 17, 2001
Janaki Krishnan

The introduction of options and futures to replace the time-tested badla
system effective July 2, 2001 will align interest rates in the money and
equity markets, leading to a more effective monetary transmission mechanism.
At a macro level, the significance of the Securities and Exchange Board of
India (Sebi) decision to ban badla and all deferral products and have only a
cash and a derivatives market marks the integration of the equity and money
markets. This means the RBI's interest rate signals will be absorbed faster
in the wider financial system. Currently, as Shekhar Sathe, CEO of Kotak
Mahindra Mutual Fund, says, there are varying badla rates on each of the
scrips eligible for carry forward. ""It is like having 200 interest rates in
the system,"" he says. Badla rates are derived as the sum of an equity risk
premium on that particular scrip over and above the interest rate component.
In effect, since the equity risk component varies from week to week and
differently in different scrips, it masks the cost of money. Thus, badla for
scrip X may be 30 per cent but for scrip Y it may be only 12 per cent. The
financial sector is sharply divided between the banking and the equities
sector.

All this is set to change with the introduction of derivatives.  At a
simplified level, since operators can take a position on the spot and
futures markets at the same time, the cost of money is already factored into
the derivative prices. This reflects the opportunity cost of taking a
forward position. Thus, an operator who buys in spot and short sells in the
futures market is actually putting up cash now in return for future gains.
Since this involves a cash outlay, the operator will at least expect his
returns to cover the interest costs for the period of the contract.
Derivatives pricing, thus, incorporates the cost of money. Says Sebi board
member J R Varma, ""The system will eventually lead to a convergence of
interest rates throughout the system."" Market sources said though the extent
of banks' involvement in the revised trading systems will only be clarified
later, there were tremendous opportunities for banks to take proprietary
positions in the derivative markets. For instance, banks could play a
leading role in the developments of ""calendar spreads"" which are basically
forward-to-forward contracts in the foreign exchange markets. Thus, a bank
may buy a one-month contract and sell a six-month contract. Since the price
of the latter will be more than that of the one-month contract, the bank
will make a net spread. But since the market rates of interest will smoothen
out over all markets, this spread will typically reflect the difference
between one-month and six-month money. ""Arbitrage opportunities like this
will lead to a uniformity of interest rates,"" Varma said. Money market
dealers welcomed the move saying that ""equities as an asset class are a
welcome addition to the limited deployment options before banks"".
Acknowledging that not all banks will be comfortable with dealing in the
equity derivatives markets, one dealer says, ""As long as one bank is
comfortable arbitraging between the money and equity markets, the rates will
align as this bank can borrow in call and deploy the funds in derivative
spreads. If the call money rates are higher, this bank can do a reverse
arbitrage."" The second implication is that equity prices in the spot markets
will respond quicker to interest rate changes. Currently, lower interest
rates will to lower interest costs for companies in the coming years,
thereby boosting its net profits. This reflects in optimism on the equity
price front after interest rates are cut. But with a derivatives market, a
rate cut will immediately impact derivative prices and arbitrageurs will
ensure that this is immediately transmitted to spot equity prices too. ""Much
like in the US, we are looking at a situation where money market rates will
determine the valuations of a wide spectrum of asset classes, and not just
gilts,"" the chief dealer, of a private bank says. ""This will lead to a much
more responsive financial system,"" he adds.


Credit protection costs down after Fed cut.
Reuters - May 17, 2001
By Tom Burroughes

LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - The cost of credit protection declined across
most sectors in the default swap market on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal
Reserve's rate cut but prices on two firms' debt rose due to planned new
issuance, dealers said.

Credit default swaps narrowed around two to three basis points for
automakers and telecoms, continuing a trend of recent weeks and further
encouraged by the Fed's 50-basis point easing on Tuesday, said a dealer for
a European bank in London.

Default swaps are insurance type instruments, which allow investors to
adjust their exposure to the risk of default or other event on a bond or
loan. They compose the most liquid part of the present credit derivative
market.

""Spreads in the cash and default (swap) market are both two to three basis
points tighter in general,"" the dealer said.

In telecoms, five-year default swaps on British Telecom were cited at 85/90,
about two basis points tighter, Deutsche Telekom were two basis points in at
98/108, and France Telecom slightly narrower at 87/97, the dealer said.

In the car sector, the dealer said protection on DaimlerChrysler has fallen
about two basis points to 87/91. Another trader at a European bank said
French carmaker Peugeot traded at 21, three bps down from the start of the
week. In banks, activity was quiet but default swaps were a touch tighter.
Deutsche Bank senior debt was cited at a bid/offer spread of 14/19.

In industrials, default swaps inched down on firms such as French glassmaker
St Gobain , which declined to a bid/offer spread of 37/43, down around four
basis points from Monday, a dealer said.

DEFYING THE TREND

Credit protection costs rose on a couple of firms to buck the general trend.
Five-year default swaps on the Swedish mobile phone company Ericsson rose 15
basis points to 115/135 from Tuesday, when bankers announced the firm was to
issue 1.25 billion euros of five-year and 250 million sterling of seven-year
bonds.

Another Scandanavian firm in play was the Finnish-Swedish forest industry
group Stora Enso , which is to issue a dollar-denominated global bond.

Five-year default swaps have widened about 10 basis points to 70/85 since
the announcement last week, said a dealer for a European bank.

MOSTLY ONE WAY

Default swaps were grinding lower on most names, in part because of
synthetic credit portfolio deals which means players who are short credit
risk are hedging their positions by selling default swaps.

The growth of the synthetic portfolio market has been pressing down credit
protection prices recently. A synthetic portfolio replicates portfolios of
bonds by selling default swaps on various names.

To change this trend players may need to believe the interest rate outlook
is changing or fresh debt supply is in the pipeline, said one dealer for a
European bank in London. ""We need some issuance and a view that rates have
bottomed out,"" he said.


Argentine bond swap seeks to calm fears of debt default
Financial Times - May 17, 2001
By Peter Hudson & Thomas Catan

David Mulford, the US banker who has played a leading role in putting
together Argentina's massive bond swap, on Wednesday defended the deal,
saying it represented a new market-led approach to tackling sovereign debt
crises.

The deal, which seeks to exchange near-term bonds for longer dated paper, is
seen as crucial to calming fears that Argentina could default on its $128bn
debt.

Investors are anxiously awaiting terms of the transaction, which Mr Mulford,
a former US Treasury undersecretary with connections to Domingo Cavallo,
Argentine economy minister, said could be launched as early as next week.

Speaking in Buenos Aires on Wednesday, Mr Mulford, international chairman at
Credit Suisse First Boston, said the deal would be easily the largest of its
kind and could resolve Argentina's financing problems without the need for
additional aid from financial institutions. The International Monetary Fund
helped assemble a package of aid worth nearly $40bn in December.

Although he declined to discuss details of the swap, citing Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations, Mr Mulford described it as ""essential to
long-term success in restoring Argentine growth"".

He added that the operation would imply a ""substantial reduction"" in debt
payments over the next three to four years. If the deal was a success, he
said, its size ""will effectively change the Argentine debt market and market
perception"".

According to bankers, the transaction could save Argentina $3bn-$4bn in debt
servicing costs before 2006, giving it time to resume growth and bring its
debt burden under control.

Argentina's benchmark FRB bond surged 2l points on Wednesday after the
Argentine president, Fernando de la Rua, signed a decree authorising the
deal.

Argentina has been mired in recession for nearly three years, raising doubts
about its ability to keep servicing foreign debt. That prospect has caused
alarm because the country accounts for almost a quarter of tradeable
emerging market debt.

Although the overall size of the debt is comparable to that of other
emerging markets, Mr Mulford said concerns about its short-term structure
meant that ""unless that is addressed it is doubtful world markets will
really support growth"" in Argentina.

The country's interest rates are at a very high level as a result of
investor uncertainty. But Mr Mulford rejected suggestions that Argentina
should await lower rates before launching the deal. ""It's essential to do
this deal now,"" he said.

with regulatory and bankruptcy counsel for the nine Complainants to discuss
the interrelation between the FERC Chargeback complaint proceeding (and the
Amendment 22 matter), the District Court case before Judge Moreno, and the 
Bankruptcy proceeding, and to discuss strategy.

The following issues have been identified as issues for discussion:

1.  Likelihood that Bankruptcy Court will grant PX motion to modify stay;
including feasibility and effort by parties to file answer in support of 
motion, including whether it would be realistic to request that the PX's 
motion be considered on a more expedited basis (PX asked for 3/30 hearing
date) in light of the FERC Complaint proceeding;

2.  Status and approach for possible settlement with PX for release of 
collateral assuming Bankruptcy Court modifies stay.

3.  Feasibility of asking Bankruptcy Court to immediately release all 
collateral in excess of amount needed to satisfy (1) vendors, (2) existing
and anticipated future defaults of SCE and PG&E, and (3) reasonable costs.
In this regard, does anyone have a handle on whether the collateral exceeds
the total of the foregoing matters?

4.  Any comments on (1) answer to PX answer to Complaint, and (2) answer
to PX request for clarification in Amendment No. 22 proceeding; including
the timing of such filings with FERC.

to have your client's bankruptcy counsel on the call, please inform them of
the time and relevant information for the call.

501,"Subject:  Pancakes

Six year old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents
pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter,
opened the cupboard, and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it
on  the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands,
mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail
on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten.  Brandon was
covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to be something
very good for his Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He didn't  know
what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove, (and
he didn't know how the stove worked)!

Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and  reached to
push her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried
to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his
pajamas white and sticky. And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.
Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was
something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was
coming, maybe even a spanking.

But his father just watched him. Then, walking through the mess, he picked
up his crying son, hugged him, and loved him, getting his own pajamas white
and sticky in the process.

That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it
turns into a mess sometimes. Our marriage gets all sticky, or we insult a
friend, or we can't stand our job, or our health goes sour. Sometimes we
just stand there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do.

That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some
of our mess gets all over Him. But just because we might mess up, we can't
stop trying to ""make pancakes,"" for God or for others.

Sooner or later we'll get it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...


Please pass some of this love on to others.

 For the evening peak prices remained strong.  TLR's prevented any movement 
of power into Florida during the evening peak.  TVA was the culprit in 
calling for TLR's.  TLR's were not called off until He  22.  For He 23 and He 
24 we sold 100mw's  to FPL at $41 and $36.  For HE 1 they bought directly 
from their neighbors at $18.  FPC, JEA and TECO were flat for these hours.  
For hours 2-6 FPL was a  $15 bid.  Due to limited hourly trans. available and 
the likelihood of TLR's a short schedule sale to Florida was not possible.    
 


SERC

TLR's were still in place for the evening peak thus limiting the import of 
power into SERC from the North.  The eveving peak saw all of SOCO interfaces 
showing -0-.  Starting HE 23  the EES side of SOCO opened up with 150 mw's.  
We were able to move Cajn power into Florida staring HE 23.  We offered SOCO 
$45 for this hour and they passed on it.  Off-peak offers were in the low 
20's.  SOCO was a $16 bid.  No one would show a decent  bid for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  The guys on shift would not show a bid or offer for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  They will wait until the afternoon to start buying.  Most of 
the night guys in SERC believe that TLR's will once again be called by TVA 
starting in the afternoon.    ","FRCC

Anyhow, this LLC was formed to co-own an SRL in Mexico that was not created because the deal in quesiton--to provide energy to automobile producers in Mexico--was put on hold.  I told somebody in your office about my desire to hold off on the LLC agreement because of this situation, and was told it was OK to do so for a little while.

529,"This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.",Pat Wood III Linda Breathitt,,"FERC ANR Columbia ANR Pipeline Co. Tennessee Gas Pipeline

530,"Another wrinkle in the El Paso/CPUC Complaint case.  I've also attached a copy of the El Paso Merchant answer to the FERC enforcement staff motion in case you're interested.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : November 2, 2001
El Paso Seeks to Derail Further Market Power Investigation 
The motion by the enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a ""more complete investigation"" of unused capacity on the system of El Paso Natural Gas is ""an abuse of process,"" the pipeline and its merchant energy affiliate claimed Thursday, since it comes after the case has been fully litigated. 
In filing a motion to strike the enforcement staff's request for the investigation, El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy said the staff motion is a violation of their due process rights, since an initial decision in the case was issued three weeks ago (see Daily GPI, Oct. 10 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011010c.html>). At that time Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. recommended the dismissal of charges that El Paso and its affiliate exercised market power to drive up prices for gas transported to the border beginning in mid-2000 [RP00-241]. The judge had concluded that the complainants in the case failed to carry their burden of proof that the El Paso companies exercised market power by withholding capacity from the market. 
After the parties file briefs on the ALJ's decision, all that remains is a vote by the commissioners, the El Paso companies pointed out. 
The investigation sought by the Market Oversight and Enforcement Section (MOE) of the Office of General Counsel ""seeks to improperly shift the burden of proof by requiring El Paso and Merchant Energy to prove that they did not withhold capacity. This argument turns the Commission's adjudicatory procedures -- and its procedural safeguards -- on their head,"" the companies said. 
""MOE is attempting to inappropriately influence the decision-making process in this already high profile case,"" putting the integrity of FERC's adjudicatory process in jeopardy. ""The rules under which the complaint is to be judged have become a moving target, El Paso's and Merchant Energy's due process rights and reputation have been harmed, and they have been put in the untenable position of now trying to prove a negative. MOE's improper comments should be disregarded and stricken from the record in this proceeding,"" the companies said. 
MOE said the issue it was raising -- whether El Paso made its unused capacity available to shippers on an IT basis, as required by FERC's open-access rule -- was neither the focus of the hearing last summer nor Wagner's initial decision (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1) <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011101d.html>.. 
MOE said its review of the public portion of the hearing record suggests that El Paso may have committed ""potential violations"" of FERC's Part 284 open-access regulations by withholding IT capacity in an attempt to keep prices up at the California border, but it said there may be ""other potential explanations"" for the existence of unused capacity on the pipeline. ""We recommend a more complete investigation of the reasons why capacity went unused on the pipeline at times during the period [of] November 2000 through March 2001."" MOE conceded its motion was an ""unusual"" move. 
It suggested that the Commission either direct MOE to conduct a further probe, remand the decision to Judge Wagner for consideration or use other procedures. Although ""this step is unusual, it is not unprecedented for the Commission's enforcement staff to inform the Commission of its views regarding potential violations concerning a pending proceeding,"" MOE said. 
El Paso pointed to a statement by the judge to back up its claim that parties in the proceeding had agreed that the pipeline was full from November through March. 

Here is a copy of the El Paso Merchant Energy response summarized above.  They used some pretty strong language!!

    At the Executive Committee meeting in February, the Executive Committee
created a new subcommittee, the Expedited Data Development (EDD)
Subcommittee.  The EDD Subcommittee has been charged with the development of
the information requirements standards for (1) imbalance netting and trading
and (2) title transfer tracking.   The Executive Committee placed a higher
priority on the imbalance netting and trading topic.

    The subcommittee's first meeting is scheduled on March 13 and 14 in
Houston, hosted at the Dynegy offices, to be held from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
 Please join me in thanking Ms. Hess of Enron Gas Pipeline Group and Ms.
Munson of Altra Energy Technologies for volunteering their time to lead this
effort.

    An agenda and work papers will be posted on the GISB Home Page shortly
for this first meeting.  The first meeting will address imbalance netting and
trading ONLY.

    If you or other representatives of your company would like your email
address to be maintained on an email distribution list for this subcommittee,
please forward your name, email address, phone and fax to the GISB office.

533,"Stan:

I have not talked directly with Coastal about their specific approach, but am 
aware of efforts to find tax relief for conversion of MTBE facilities to 
alkalytes.   This is also an option that has been discussed in the OFA and 
MTBE Producer groups.   It certainly could be a viable ""fallback"" position to 
stranded cost recovery.

However, Coastal is very differently situated than Enron in terms of stranded 
costs or liability protection.   Refiners can't make as good a case for 
stranded costs as the merchant producers of MTBE who developed unique 
facilites directly in response to the Clean Air Act oxygenate mandate.   On 
liability protection, refiners and marketers are more directly responsible 
for groundwater contamination with MTBE because they have the leaking tanks 
-- so they have what could be characterized as ""contributory negligence"", 
where MTBE producers do not.

I agree with Steve Kean's response -- going after liability protection is 
probably going to be more viable than finding stranded costs.   We will keep 
pressing both issues, and distinguishing ourselves as one of the ""good 
actors"" that responded to the Clean Air Act to produce MTBE and has not 
contributed to gasoline spills.

 In terms of conversion to alkalytes, one of the complicating factors is the 
""tax"" angle.   In all the current legislative efforts in the House and 
Senate, the sponsors are avoiding inclusion of tax provisions so that the 
bills do not have to go through review by the separate tax committees, which 
would delay the legislation probably to its demise.   Passing separate tax 
legislation that contains alkalyte conversion provisions may also be 
difficult -- in general, it will be hard for Congress to pass even modest tax 
legislation this year.   

If this emerges as a viable strategy, however, I think it is worth 
consideration.   I will talk with Coastal to see what their strategy is and 
follow up with you and Jim Prentice to see if it's appropriate to pursue.

541,"Gale, here is the information that I have available about the subject interconnect.  The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of 12-15 MMcfd to ENA for power generating.  The problem is that the lateral capacity is about 25-27 MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point, but Citizens has about 25 MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end.  Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point (Kevin is checking on this); however, I don't believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point (two-2"" regulators) can do more than 15 MMcfd (my intuitive guess, needs to be checked or verified).  Pressure - TW may be between 725-775 psig at peak TW mainline flows to Ca., Citizens pressure is reported to be around 365 psig downstream of control valves.  
 
The greatest daily volume (MN 9213) since Jan 2000 was 11942 Mcf on Jan. 18, 2001 (as can be seen in the attached Excel worksheet extracted from MIPS meas. data).  The flow graph on Jan 18, 2001 also obtained from MIPS is shown below:
 

  


Planning Question: if Citizens meter capacity is say 15 MMcfd at some pressure, can we subscribe the remaining lateral capacity to ENA and still maintain pressure and volume obligations to either Citizens or ENA?  What would new pressure conditions look like flowing 30 MMcfd through the lateral?

Finally, we need to establish on which platform these approvals will be 
managed. The Approval Form that I sent around previously is acceptable for ad

forward I think that we will require some kind of database, may be like the

_____________________________________________

I think that the ""general policies"" route is the right (and only) one - 
particularly for the vast number of reference entities envisaged.  From a 
legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all 
clear, provided
in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty 
of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc).  
We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not 
per se a legal task)
in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal 
due diligence in its country of establishment/location
in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal 
due diligence in its country of establishment/location

Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in 
the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as 
generically as possible.

Title: California on the Brink 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas 

CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK 
The California Stalemate 
California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over 
credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would 
avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have 
contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the 
root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current 
credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address 
the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be 
focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible.

Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this 
summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California 
consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis, 
regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and 
significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied 
the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end 
their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance 
the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable 
accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market. 

The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the 
galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to 
address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is 
no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective 
solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail 
markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain 
muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is 
possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail 
to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will 
instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws. 

In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western 
markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem. 
Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market 
environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and 
demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for 
the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed, 
several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by 
discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated 
changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a 
challenging siting and permitting process.

Medicine Worse than the Illness 
Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were 
accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay 
adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus 
over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of 
bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of 
California's electric market woes.* 

* Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better 
coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power 
plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone 
has struck down some key proposed facilities.

* Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices 
limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially 
for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment 
to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state. 

* Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including 
the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new 
plant development.

* Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the 
FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the 
California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of 
gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits 
are a threat to new plant development.

* Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials 
to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of 
their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust.

CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West 
are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability 
are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of 
older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors. 
California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of 
financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers 
considering entering the state. 

Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in 
the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that 
demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001. 
In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a 
sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the 
earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of 
capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk 
of an outage. 

The Road to Recovery 
There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity 
shortfall: 

* Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a 
series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal 
some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these 
actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not 
enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.? 

* Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will 
ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the 
credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new 
build.

* Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the 
pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence 
(and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in 
the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With 
the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move 
toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a 
series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If 
they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect 
of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient 
justification for recovering the cost of these commitments.

* Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although 
originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are 
insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing 
customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a 
demand response.

* Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the ""Boom Bust"" characteristic of 
the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement, 
or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to 
move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the 
market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to 
elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate) 
future price volatility.

* Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to 
be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable 
to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term 
contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the 
market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since 
July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to 
do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its 
course. 

* Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a 
more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply 
shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to 
emissions restrictions. 

* Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA 
power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from 
operating to generate only power.

me to offer him, and I told him that I would have to discuss it with you and 
get back to him.   I am glad that he has seen his way a little more clearly, 
and I will call him tomorrow to finalize the offer.

                    Do the math. The slogan favoured by Jim Clark, creator of 
Silicon Graphics,
                    Net-scape and Healtheon, has become the mantra of a 
generation of
                    consultants and investment bankers. The new economy, they 
claim, requires
                    new principles of valuation. 

                    C.com is one of the most exciting prospects in 
business-to-business
                    commerce. It is the world leader in a growing market - 
annual sales by 2010
                    are likely to be Dollars 500,000bn. If C.com can maintain 
a 5 per cent share
                    and earn only 1 per cent net margin its prospective 
annual earnings will be
                    Dollars 250bn. 

                    If we assume that market growth after 2010 is 5 per cent 
and discount future
                    revenues at 10 per cent, the prospective value of C.com 
is Dollars 5,000bn -
                    about 10 times the recent market capitalisation of 
Microsoft, Cisco or General
                    Electric. 

                    You don't have to wait for the IPO. You can buy shares in 
C.com right now for
                    less than 5 per cent of that value. C.com is called 
Citigroup and in addition to
                    its foreign exchange trading, which is the business I 
have described, you get
                    its other wholesale, retail and investment banking 
activities and a leading
                    insurance company thrown in. 

                    Of course, nobody would be so stupid as to value 
Citigroup in this way. Yet I
                    have followed more or less exactly the methodology 
recommended in the
                    latest McKinsey quarterly for the valuation of new era 
companies. They use
                    precisely analogous calculations to arrive at a valuation 
of Dollars 37bn for
                    Amazon.com. 

                    Paul Gibbs, head of merger and acquisition research at 
J.P. Morgan, recently
                    used similar principles to confirm that assessment of 
Amazon. He then
                    performed the same calculation for internet service 
provider Freeserve. 

                    Assume that UK retail sales grow at 5 per cent a year, 
that 25 per cent of
                    sales take place on the net, that portals capture 50 per 
cent of these, that
                    Freeserve gets 30 per cent of the portal share and 
maintains an 8 per cent
                    commission on sales. Multiply these together and you 
establish that in 2017
                    Freeserve will make profits of o2bn (Dollars 3.2bn). 
This, he argues, justifies a
                    value today of o6.50 per share. 

                    But I prefer T.com to Freeserve. T.com has a customer 
base four times larger
                    than Freeserve. Its franchise is stronger. Its customers 
are concentrated in
                    the affluent south-east of England, where it faces 
virtually no competition.
                    Market research shows that more than 95 per cent of its 
customers use its
                    essential services every day, many of them several times 
a day. 

                    T.com also has ambitious plans for expansion. At present, 
its geographical
                    coverage is less than one-quarter of the market in 
England and Wales. T.com
                    has an interest in south-east Asia. The population of 
China is 100 times the
                    number of people who today can access T.com services. 
Even after the recent
                    market correction, T.com, better known as Thames Water, 
still has a market
                    valuation below that of Freeserve. At the widest point 
between the old and new
                    economies, Freeserve was worth four times as much. 

                    The reason the Citibank calculation is nonsense is 
simple, but fundamental.
                    The margins Citibank makes on its forex business vary 
widely. If you buy
                    small quantities of notes from a bank, the spread is much 
wider than 1 per
                    cent. If you are a large corporation trading major 
currencies, the margin is
                    wafer thin. Entry and competition force prices down to 
the related costs. 

                    In Mr Gibbs's model, Freeserve earns profits of o2bn, 
about equal to the
                    current profits of Tesco, J. Sainsbury and Marks and 
Spencer together. And it
                    earns these on revenues of only o2.5bn, so that profits 
are 80 per cent of the
                    value of its sales. No established business earns margins 
of that size. 

                    Thames Water is one of a tiny number of companies whose 
market position is
                    so strong, whose output is so necessary to life, that if 
it charged five times the
                    current price we would have little choice but to pay. We 
do have one option -
                    to insist the government intervenes. It confines Thames 
Water to a return on
                    its capital employed of about 6 per cent. 

                    The idea that profit is a return on capital invested 
still has some role in new
                    economy valuation, at the level of the overall market. 

                    There is a key formula in the new math. The required 
yield on a security is
                    equal to the difference between the rate of return 
demanded from that class of
                    securities and its expected rate of growth. So, if you 
expect a return of 5.5 per
                    cent from a share whose dividends will grow at 5 per 
cent, calculations show
                    that the dividend yield should be 0.5 per cent. 

                    This is the calculation done by James Glassman and Kevin 
Hassett in their
                    book Dow 36,000*. Claiming that sustainable dividends 
average half of
                    earnings, this yield equates to a price/earnings ratio of 
100 - implying a target
                    of 36,000 for the US index. 

                    The trouble with this theory is that it takes too long to 
produce what the
                    investor is looking for. Investors will receive only 
two-fifths of the cash
                    sustaining the valuation this century. One-third of the 
total depends on
                    dividend cheques that will arrive after 2200. 

                    Two hundred years ago, well before the Dow Jones average, 
prudent,
                    diversified investors would have owned slave traders and 
sugar plantations, or
                    perhaps a bold speculation in that symbol of the then new 
economy -a canal.
                    The next 200 years may be more stable than the last and 
Microsoft and Cisco
                    may prove more enduring than plantations. But we can 
hardly be sure. 

                    While 5 per cent may be a reasonable assumption for the 
growth rate of
                    dividends in the US economy as a whole, it is likely that 
well before 2200
                    most of these will come from companies not yet founded. 

                    Suppose we accept Glassman and Hassett's protests that 
their dividend
                    growth expectations are conservative. If you raise them 
only from 5 per cent to
                    5.25 per cent, the anticipated value of the Dow Jones 
average is 72,000. At
                    5.5 per cent the formula breaks down because the shares 
of US companies
                    are infinitely valuable. Not even the most credulous 
dotcom investor believes
                    that. 

                    The math also works in reverse. If expectations of return 
are 6 per cent rather
                    than 5.5 per cent, the market p/e ratio falls to 50 and 
the value of the Dow
                    Jones from 36,000 to 18,000. And if equity investors 
require a return of 8 per
                    cent, you would have to conclude that shares are worth 
only half their current
                    level. 

                    An 8 per cent expected total return is not ambitious for 
an equity investor. A
                    day trader might think you were talking about a weekly 
profit rather than
                    annual. Glassman and Hassett use a figure as low as 5.5 
per cent - the return
                    on Treasury bonds - because they argue that equities have 
so consistently
                    outperformed bonds that there is now no risk associated 
with equity
                    investment. In other words, because equities are sure to 
offer higher returns
                    than bonds, the expected yield on equities should be the 
same as on bonds. 

                    You do not have to be Wittgenstein to spot the flaw. The 
rules of logic hold
                    even in cyberspace, and so do the principles of 
economics. Profits are hard to
                    earn in competitive businesses, and markets that are not 
competitive are
                    usually regulated. The value of companies ultimately 
depends on their
                    capacity to generate cash for shareholders. Distant 
returns are uncertain.
                    Share prices are volatile, and investors need to be 
compensated for the risks.
                    These truths are as valid in the new economy as the old. 

                    By all means do the math. Isaac Newton, who could do the 
math better than
                    most, gave up an annuity of o650 per year to invest in 
the South Sea Bubble.
                    In addition to the math, you need the econ, the pol, and 
perhaps the
                    psychology.

***********************************************************************

US WEST HYDRO ON THE RISE, DEMAND LOW

Shifting 2002 electricity demand drivers and improvement of hydroelectric
conditions in the US West continue to change the outlook for 2002 and beyond.
Although 2002 demand will still contract from 2001 levels, CERA's updated
outlook calls for modestly stronger demand than previously forecasted. The weak
January fundamentals that have dragged down Henry Hub and western regional gas
prices should continue through February.

*  The level of voluntary and price-responsive electricity conservation in
California appears to be falling as the supply crisis abates.

*  Gas prices have been kept at bay by the lack of evidence of the expected
decline in US supply and weak national economic trends that point to further
delay in the rebound of industrial and power generation demand.

*  The abundant western snowpacks that will be shown to the world during the
winter Olympics are having an impact on regional energy markets.

THE STORAGE OPTIONS

Ever since September 11th, spending on storage has increased.
How are you ensuring that you're choosing the right network
storage options?  Network World's Deni Connor evaluates the
networked storage options. Before you start spending next
year's budget check out what Connor has to say at:

Today's focus: All I want for Christmas

By Mike Karp

Dear Editor,

I am eight years old. Some of my friends say there is no Santa
Claus. Papa says, ""If you see it in the storage newsletter,
it's so."" He is an IT director. Please tell me the truth, is
there a Santa Claus? If there is, please give him this wish
list from Papa.

Dear Santa,

I would really like the following for Christmas. If that is not
possible, I would be glad to accept them for Chanukah or
Kwanzaa or Arbor Day or Midsummer Night's Eve.

1) A self-configuring storage-area network, please, with
   switches from two different vendors and a whole lot of storage
   from Compaq and IBM and a couple of others that I could choose
   when the need arises.

2) Network-attached storage boxes that scale well into the
   multiterabyte range.

3) Storage management software that knows something about the
   applications that are running in my shop.

4) An objective method of comparing vendor claims about
   performance and install time. Maybe a suite of industry-wide
   benchmarks, and an independent testing lab that would certify
   key points.

5) Industry standards written so clearly that even the hardware
   vendors can understand them.

6) Backups that are so reliable I can count on being able to
   restore 100% of the data I send to tape.

7) The foresight to do disaster planning BEFORE the next
   disaster, and if a disaster does take place, the ability to
   recover from it by the next business day.

8) The near-magical ability to service my remote sites easily.

9) A definition of virtualization that more than two industry
   vendors can agree on, and that I can understand.

10) Disks from a redundant array of independent disks vendor
    that don't cost five times more than the street price my kid
    can buy them for.

11) Asset management software that automatically discovers and
    configures my environment.

12) No more visits by vendors that promise storage management,
    but really only offer the capability to monitor.

13) The ability to sleep at night (get me any three of the
    above, and I'm pretty sure this will result).

14) A teddy bear for comfort, just in case you can't provide
    any of the others items I have listed.

My friend Roberto has his own list, but mine is much more
reasonable. If you will get me the things I ask for, I will be
really good for the next four quarters, and I promise to live
up to all my service-level agreements and justify all my
purchases with really great ROI analysis so my CFO can
understand what I am doing.

Thanks,
Santa

P.S. Please don't smoke your pipe in the computer room. We are
all sorry about that business with the Halogen last year.

interviews, the technical team will review the documented interviews to 
determine any required missing information.    When possible, we will try to 
replace the followup interview with a followup email and/or phone call to

Typical follow-up questions will be:   
What are your sources of data/information?  
Where is the data/information currently stored?  
Is the data/information automatically fed into SAP from another system?
Please provide samples of reports/queries (including detailed calculations) 
that demonstrate the information you desire.   

Please be prepared to answer the above mentioned questions and/or refer us to 
the appropriate parties so that we can all make the best use of our time.

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.

103 Stochastic Modelling

106 Actuarial Mathematics II
107 Economics
108 Finance and Financial Reporting
109 Financial Economics

302 Life insurance

Having reviewed, I think the most suitable ones to order are suggested in

stick to 103 through 106 for o356 -> I suggest we go for the smaller sub-set

658,"I think it's a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for 
Bush.  I think the electricity section needs some additions though.  There is 
not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and 
power lines -- its largely a state and local decision.  Further, the problem 
has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to 
utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to 
opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Once utilities are in the 
open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the 
grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to 
connect to the grid.  The answer is open access, so power can get from where 
it is to where it is needed.  This has been clear for a long time, yet the 
current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their 
authority to make this happen.  The result: spiking prices and reliability 
problems.

Thursday, Oct. 19.  Bernadette called each of your assistants, so it should 
be on your calendars.

As a brief update prior to our call:

We have a phone call in to FERC to check on the procedural status of the 
merger.  Donna Fulton, my colleague in Washington, has many contacts at FERC 
and is working with those people to learn what she can about the status of 
our proceeding.  

Joanne is supposed to be meeting with Bob Wasson at the SEC (along with Bill 
Weedon) early next week to get a sense of where the SEC is on the case.

Per Rick's suggestion, I have asked another colleague of mine in Washington, 
Chris Long, to help us decide who would be the appropriate person to make 
contact at the SEC if we decide to make that contact.  Chris is working with 
some political operatives on this.

We have been working with Portland General and Sierra on their RTO filing.  
As you may recall, a commitment to join an RTO (Regional Transmission 
Organization) is one of the things FERC will require of the merging parties.  
An RTO filing will be made at FERC on October 23.  While RTO progress has 
been good so far, Sierra and PGE have indicated that they may have concerns 
with the RTO they are working with (the Northwest RTO).  We are working with 
Sierra and PGE to make sure that they do not do anything in the RTO 
proceeding that could cause concern for FERC regarding the companies' 
commitment to join an RTO.

There was some question about the status of a temporary services company 
being created by the merged company.  Joanne has been working with the Sierra 
and PGE people on this issue and does not see this as being a problem now, 
but I have asked her for confirmation that this ""alternative"" type of service 
company arrangement will not delay the SEC proceeding.  I am waiting for a 
response from Joanne.

DJ Greenspan Cites Concern About Electric Sector Investment
Dow Jones International News Service -- July 20, 2000  [Return to Headlines]


WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told
Congress Thursday he is concerned that disincentives for investment in the
electricity sector will destabilize the overall U.S. economy.

""The propensity to build new electric power facilities is being
disincentivized,"" Greenspan said.

""I'm worried about the instability that that creates within the economy and
the difficulties that might emerge as a consequence of that,"" the Fed
chairman said in response to a query by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.

""It is an issue we need to address,"" Greenspan said.

U.S. utilities have failed to make needed investments in generation plants
and transmission lines over the last decade in the face of regulatory
uncertainty posed by state and federal deregulation efforts.

Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has been touring the country in recent
months, warning that the problem is contributing to power supply shortages
in summer months, when hot weather sends electricity demand - and prices -
soaring.

Richardson says Congress needs to enact a comprehensive bill restructuring
the $215 billion electric industry to end the uncertainty and give the
sector renewed incentive to make needed investments. By Bryan Lee;Dow Jones

679,"A very senior attorney in Delhi (perhaps a retired Supreme Court justice?) 
has advised Enron that MERC has no jurisdiction over the PPA and cannot 
establish regulations on things like merit order dispatch, much less set the 
merit order dispatch.  A written legal opinion has been requested.  The 
thought of the Linklaters attorneys (both Sandeep Katwala and Chris Walker) 
and tentatively Wade is that the MERC may be DPC's worst enemy if it has 
jurisdiction over the renegotiated PPA (which it will) and must approve it; 
thus, it may be better to take the offensive and challenge its jurisdiction 
over merit order dispatch.    The strategy isn't fully formed yet, but I 
wonder about the wisdom of (i) taking on a regulator that could be in a 
position to approve a renegotiated PPA; and (ii) how a jurisdictional 
challenge to a regulator attempting to restructure squares with Enron's 
positions/reputation worldwide.  I'll be discussing this with all parties 
when I get back to work after New Year's and will let you know as this issue 
progresses.

Enron is as I speak seriously contemplating pulling the letters of credit.  
We've been told by the Chairman of MSEB that he has some money but he is not 
going to pay October's bill for DPC.  According to him, DPC was forced on 
MSEB by the Gov't of Maharashtra, so we should pursue our financial and legal 
remedies.  The Government of course will want to renegotiate in exchange for 
payment.  Here we go.

681,"FYI.  As you know, we're attempting to find a solution to the ""reasonable 
review"" morrass that's impeding utility forward contracting.  For that 
effort, we've worked with the Portland desk to pull together some educational 
materials to use with a subset of California stakeholders that's trying to 
devise a solution to California's melt down.

The attached graphs show 3 scenarios for the state as a whole.  
1) ""do nothing""  
2) for 60% of IOU short position, split the amount 50-50 and 1cover half the 
amount with 10-year  fixed priced power and the other half with 5-year fixed 
priced power.
3) create a portfolio with a) 25% of short position covered by 10-year fixed 
priced power, b) 20% of short position covered by 5-year fixed price power, 
c) 15% covered by 1-year fixed price power, d) 20% covered by May-Sept 
fixed-price power, and e) 15% from the PX.  

The term of each scenario is 5 years.

Because each is priced off our our curves, the average price is roughly 
equivalent for each of the three portfolios.  However, the graph shows (as 
one would expect) that exposure to price volatility is significantly higher 
under scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3.

The goal is to use the illustrative scenarios to persuade the industry that 
in the short run (i.e., immediately) the utilities should be permitted to buy 
a modest amount of power under 5 and 10 terms, and those purchases (if 
undertaken using a ""DealBench-like"" tool) ought to be ""per se"" reasonable.

through the changes to see if they are beneficial to Enron.

For example, the changes being made to solve the ""Blackbird Issue"" (see p. 29

Gramm's Swap exclusion language of section 107 seems broader than the

If Gramm were to ask Ken Lay if we were supportive of these changes how would 
we respond?  I have a hunch our response is that a perfect bill would be

I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to

serious mistake.  Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for 
years if it passes reliability only legislation.  I think the legislation 
itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on 
making progress at FERC and in other fora.

I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop, but it would be 
such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that 
we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it.  If it gets through 
committee, I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into 
something better and broader, so, again, I have difficulty seeing why we

First Important Lesson - Everyone's job is important

During my second month of nursing school, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I 
was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions, until I 
read the last one:

""What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?""

Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several 
times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50's, but how would I know her 
name? I left the question blank.

Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count 
toward our quiz grade. ""Absolutely,"" said the professor. ""In your careers, 
you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention 
and care, even if all you do is smile and say 'hello'.""

""I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.


Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain

One night, at 11:30 PM, an older African American woman was standing on the 
side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had 
broken down and she desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to 
flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her, generally 
unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s.

The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi 
cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry, but   wrote down his address and 
thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door. To his 
surprise, a giant  onsole color TV was delivered to his home.

A special note was attached. It read: ""Thank you so much for assisting me on 
the highway the other night. The rain  drenched not only my clothes, but also 
my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make it to my 
dying husband's bedside just before he passed away. God bless you for helping 
me and unselfishly serving others."" Sincerely, Mrs. Nat King Cole.

Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve.

In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy 
entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of 
water in front of him. ""How much is an ice cream sundae?"" he asked.

""Fifty cents,"" replied the waitress.

The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it. 
""Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?"" he inquired.

By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing 
impatient. ""Thirty-five cents,"" she brusquely  replied.""

The little boy again counted his coins. ""I'll have the plain ice cream,"" he 
said. The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and 
walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left.

When the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. 
There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies 
-- You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left 
to leave her a tip.

Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path

In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid 
himself and watched to see if anyone would  remove the huge rock.  

Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply 
walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads 
clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way. 

Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the 
boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the 
side of the road. 

After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant 
picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed  a purse lying in the road where 
the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins ad a note from the 
king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from 
the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand: 

Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.

Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts 

Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a 
little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her 
only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year 
old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed 
the antibodies needed to combat the illness.

The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the 
little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. 

I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, 
""Yes, I'll do it if it will save her.""

As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, 
as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew 
pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a 
trembling  voice, ""Will I start to die right away?""

Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was 
going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.

You see, after all, understanding and attitude, are everything.",Dorothy God Nat King Cole Liz,"Fifty cents Thirty-five cents two nickels and five pennies

691,"Pacific Gas and Electric Company Receives Court Approval of Second-Day Motions



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 9, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -

Utility Granted Authority to Continue Efforts to Secure Natural Gas


Supplies, Use Cash Collateral for Normal Business Operations


Pacific Gas and Electric Company today received approval from the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California, of
various second-day motions.


These orders will enable Pacific Gas and Electric Company to
continue to fulfill post-petition obligations to suppliers and other
creditors without disruption, and so that all parties' interests are
considered, and treated fairly. The goal of these early proceedings is
to assure stability of the company, in accordance with bankruptcy law.


The court granted the utility the authority to continue to use its
natural gas revenues to secure future supplies, hopefully ensuring
that there will be no disruption of service for millions of natural
gas customers.


The court also authorized interim use of cash collateral in which
mortgage bondholders have a beneficial interest, and scheduled and
established deadlines relating to a final hearing on the continued use
of cash collateral.


Also today, Pacific Gas and Electric Company asked the Court to
allow at least a 60 day suspension of a requirement approved by the
CPUC on March 27, that would force PG&amp;E to restate all its regulatory
books and accounts back to Jan. 1, 1998 in order to prolong the
current electric rate freeze and make it appear that PG&amp;E has never
incurred any operating losses on its wholesale power costs since the
energy crisis began.


Under the CPUC order, PG&amp;E is required to file tariffs and reports
by Wednesday, April 11, making the accounting changes and restating
its books. PG&amp;E believes the CPUC accounting and ratemaking change is
intended to interfere with the rights of creditors and shareholders to
recover over $8.9 billion in undercollected power costs that the
company has accrued since last summer. Under federal bankruptcy law,
PG&amp;E, as a ""debtor in possession,"" generally has an additional 60 days
to comply with various deadlines issued by other agencies, and actions
by those agencies which would interfere with creditors rights and the
value of PG&amp;E's assets cannot be implemented without approval of the
bankruptcy judge.


At the Court's request, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the
CPUC are currently negotiating on an extension of this filing
requirement, and is hopeful that an agreed upon solution can be
reached in a timely manner.

California to get info on CA's energy crisis. Yesterday, they met in 
Sacramento.  Today, there in San Jose (Edison, PG&E and some Silicon Valley 
businesses are witnesses), and tomorrow they're in San Diego.  The hearing 
was widely covered on local TV news.  As the following story reflects, it was 
very partisan.


	Political shots traded at U.S. power inquiry 
	By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published April 11, 2001) 
	It was billed as a nonpartisan inquiry into the roots of California's energy 
crisis. 
	""We're not here to assign blame,"" Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said Tuesday at a 
hearing in Sacramento of a House subcommittee. ""We're not here to point 
fingers. We're here to listen and learn."" 
	But by the end, blame had been doled out in heaping portions and the fingers 
had come out of their holsters. 
	Rep. Doug Ose, the Sacramento Republican who is chairman of the panel, 
blasted Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, for keeping secret the details of the 
state's long-term electricity contracts. He raised the possibility of issuing 
subpoenas. 
	So did Burton, who sharply questioned Loretta Lynch, president of the 
California Public Utilities Commission, about whether the commission 
prevented investor-owned utilities from signing long-term contracts for cheap 
electricity. Lynch was appointed to the commission by Davis. 
	Lynch said the utilities were given permission and did sign contracts, but 
declined to give details, saying she was legally barred from doing so. 
	""We represent the Congress of the United States,"" Burton fired back. ""We want 
that information."" 
	The panel of the House Committee on Government Reform consists of 13 members, 
but only three attended, all of them Republicans -- Ose, Burton and Rep. 
Steve Horn of Long Beach. 
	All 13 were invited, as well as members of Congress whose districts are being 
visited by the subcommittee, which also plans to hold hearings this week in 
San Jose and San Diego. 
	""I'm frankly surprised they're not here,"" said Yier Shi, a spokesman for the 
subcommittee. ""This is a bipartisan issue."" 
	But if Democrats weren't on the podium, some were in the audience, including 
state party campaign adviser Bob Mulholland. He called the hearing ""a 
Republican sham to protect the Texas energy companies,"" and circulated quotes 
from former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, praising the legislation that 
created deregulation. 
	Much of the testimony focused on whether the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission should impose price caps on wholesale electricity prices. 
	Lynch said it was the only way to impose rationality on a ""dysfunctional 
market"" in which electricity generators and marketers are free to drive up 
prices far beyond what they would be in a competitive market. 
	Others, including FERC's general counsel, Kevin Madden, called caps a bad 
idea that would encourage sellers to go elsewhere, reducing California's 
power supply. Madden also said a cap imposed by FERC would only cover about 
half the power bought and sold in the West.

                 Gov. Davis Plans To Enact Physics Regulations


LOS ANGELES (NAP) - Encouraged by the success of recent legislative efforts to
control the laws of supply and demand for electricity, Gov. Gray Davis 
announced
today the introduction of new changes to the laws of physics.

""We've been suffering too long at the hands of pin-headed scientists and 
engineers
who can't think outside the box,"" Gov. Davis said to an enthusiastic crowd 
outside the
UC Berkeley campus.

Gov. Davis blasted opponents who called the plan to regulate basic physics 
equations
""insane"" and ""impossible."" Responded Gov. Davis, ""Remember the so-called 
economists who said that price controls lead to shortages.  Well, look who's 
laughing now?!""

The new regulatory program is headed by Professor Eugene 'Skippy'Shepperson 
of UC Berkeley, who has been dubbed the Paul Krugman of electrical 
engineering.

""It's really quite astonishing. By fudging a couple coefficients and 
rearranging Ohm's
law, and a couple other mandates, we can double the efficiency of our 
existing power
plants with no environmental side effects. In fact, with no changes to the 
infrastructure at all. It's a real win-win situation,"" Skippy claimed.

The regulatory program consists of legislating a decrease in the resistive 
coefficient of copper and aluminum, commonly used in high tension wires.  ""We 
should be able to considerably cut down on transmission losses with the new 
regulations. The computer models say that we shouldn't lose any electricity 
at all,"" Skippy commented in a speech before Gov. Davis took the podium.

Keys to the program include several changes to the famous R=V/I equation, 
so-called Ohm's Law. Details are still forthcoming, as Skippy's address was 
cut short
when his frantic hand waving injured three bystanders.

""I can't believe we let physics get away with being unregulated for so many 
years,""
declared Jeni Flowerpot of the California NIMBY Coalition. ""We have some 
serious gripes with chemistry and biology, as well. If we can tinker with 
economics and physics, why the wait to get true pollution control and sexual 
equality?"" asked the CNIABEC representative.

The new regulatory program would set an interesting precedent in the state 
that has
given birth to many innovative legislative efforts.  ""If this program is 
successful, we have plans to investigate the Second Law of Thermodynamics for 
antitrust violations,"" Gov. Davis continued to rousing applause.

""Getting something for nothing is every Californian's right!"" 

Leading scientists in universities not located in California were skeptical, 
however.
""I want some of what Skippy's been smoking,"" stated Professor Sara Powell of 
Duke
University in North Carolina. ""You can't change the laws of nature when you 
don't
like the results. Physics isn't Calvinball.""

Gov. Davis and his supporters were not swayed in their support for Skippy and 
his
new ideas in the field of electrical engineering.

""If this program does fail, we'll have only the greedy out of state electric 
companies to blame. Everybody knows that they rake in excessive profits when
they don't sell electricity,"" Gov. Davis replied.","Davis Gray Davis

SMITH INTRODUCES BILL TO BAN MTBE IN REFORMULATED GASOLINE

Acknowledging the uphill battle that lies ahead, Senate Environment
Committee Chairman Bob Smith introduced on Thursday a bill to ban the
use of a key component in the Clean Air Act's reformulated gasoline
program.

As a sign of his intention to press ahead on the issue, Smith also
announced a full committee markup of the bill (S 2962) for Sept. 7.

Smith (R-N.H.) declared on the Senate floor: ""We need to ban MTBE. ...
There will be no environmental backsliding.""

Smith said he had hoped to introduce the bill a day earlier, but he was
still trying to solicit support from the main stakeholders on the issue.

Smith's bill would ban the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether, an
oxygenate used in 85 percent of reformulated gasoline, because of
groundwater contamination problems that have occurred in several states,
including New Hampshire.

While acknowledging that MTBE is effective in reducing air pollution,
Smith said it can migrate through the water table and has contaminated
drinking water supplies.

The ban of MTBE, a petroleum derivative used for years by the oil
industry, would boost dramatically the demand for ethanol, an
agriculture-based fuel that is the competing oxygenate in the
reformulated gasoline program.

Smith alluded to the tough negotiations he has had over the past six
months with the ethanol lobby and the petroleum industry. ""There are
people who are dug in for various reasons,"" Smith said.

Smith has made the MTBE ban one of his top legislative priorities this
year. ""It has to pass,"" Smith said. He also warned: ""This is a tough,
tough issue. Everybody's not going to get what they want.""

Smith promised that his bill ""won't reduce the environmental benefits of
the Clean Air program.""

In describing the main features of his bill, Smith said state governors
would have the option of waiving the 2 percent oxygenate requirement in
their state that is part of the reformulated gasoline program.

The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, which established the reformulated
gasoline program for the nation's most polluted cities, require that 2
percent by weight of a gallon of gasoline must be oxygen.

MTBE was the oxygenate of choice for the petroleum industry, because of
its abundance and cheap cost of production.

Smith said his bill also would give states the authority to ban the use
of MTBE within their state. EPA also would have the authority to ban
MTBE immediately. The bill itself would phase out MTBE within four
years.

Smith's bill also would provide $200 million from the leaking
underground storage tank fund to clean up MTBE-contaminated sites.

The bill would authorize EPA to conduct a study of the environmental
consequences of the nation's transportation fuel supply.

Smith noted that while Midwestern senators strongly support a boost for
ethanol, the alternative fuel has its own environmental problems. The
main concern is that ethanol prompts faster evaporation of gasoline into
the atmosphere, which is a concern in New England and in California.

Smith said he also was interested in establishing a program to boost the
development of non-petroleum-based, alternative transportation fuels. He
then introduced his own amendment to his own bill, based on draft
legislation that he had been circulating among members.

Smith acknowledged that a ban on MTBE would increase the cost of
reformulated gasoline. He estimated his proposal would cost consumers
approximately 3 cents to 4 cents per gallon extra in areas where
reformulated gasolines were required.

A proposal put forth by the ethanol industry -- to ban MTBE but keep the
2 percent oxygenate requirement, which would be met by ethanol -- would
cost 8 cents per gallon and was unacceptable, Smith said.

Smith said he disagreed with the Clinton administration's proposal to
ban MTBE and establish an ethanol mandate. He estimated the cost at 6
cents per gallon. ""Let the markets decide,"" Smith said.

Smith also noted that the oil industry ""is not real thrilled about
this.""",Bob Smith Smith Clinton,"$200 million approximately 3 cents to 4 cents 8 cents 6

714,"Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.					

The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session.
The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.

The Legislature's options: 
1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning.
2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a ""waiver,"" which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.
3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.

In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.

Where to from here?
Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.
Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that ""...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'"" and ""...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end.""  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.  
Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough.
With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.
Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said:
Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without ""adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses.""
He doesn't know why ""the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session.""
With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.

If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.

We'll report back with additional information as we get it.

725,"This is an OK bill.  Not well drafted. It's also overly complicated and 
proscriptive.

Deletes the offensive part of ABX 1.
It allows anybody to do whatever they want until June 1 (section 2 d)
On June 1, 
  - res and small commercial customers can get in a cue and get DA up to the 
# of MWs that are added through load growth. (Section 2 e)
  -- Larger customers would pay an exit fee. (section 2 f)
  -- DA customers would be a entrance fee to return to IOU service (Section 2 
g)

There is also a confusing section (2 c) that says a retail customer is only 
stuck with CDWR for the proportion of power that CDWR provides.  The way it 
reads, if CDWR is providing 40% of the IOUs' power, the retail customer can 
get DA for 60% of its load.  I doubt that will fly -- too difficult to keep 
track of and ISO will oppose (only one scheduling coordinator/meter)

726,"Here are some quick and dirty ideas on the ISO report and FERC filing.  I'm 
just reading it, so something more will come later.

Gov Davis is trying to divert attention from his bad public policy ideas.  
A significant reason that prices are high and continue to be high is that the 
ISO is expecting people to sell when they have no idea whether they will be 
paid.  
The Governor, the ISO and the EOB have all failed to acknowledge that simple 
fact.  When there is a huge risk of receiving payment, a rational seller 
would include some risk premium in the price. Like a bank offering credit 
cards at higher interest rates to people with shakey credit. 
The ISO is not paying its bills and has lost its creditworthy status.
THE ISO REPORTAND FERC FILING DO NOT HAVE ONE WORD IN THEM ABOUT THIS CREDIT 
ISSUE.
The ISO's report evaluates components of sellers' ""costs"" and calculates 
purported ""unjust and unreasonable"" prices, all without mentioning the 
creditworthy status of the ISO or the risk of doing business with a 
non-creditworthy party.
Of course, this whole problem could have been avoided or greatly reduced, if 
Governor Davis had taken action when it was first identified as a problem in 
August, 2000. 
Governor Davis has still not addressed this very basic and pressing issue. 
His idea to purchase the transmission system doesn't solve the problem and 
takes time and resources.  Lots of them.
By the way, the ISO's statement that it is entitled to the data is really a 
FERC issue and FERC will decide.  FERC did not order this and the ISO wants 
FERC to order it.  We don't usually hold press conferences about FERC issues 
of this nature.
This whole debate/disagreement does nothing to (1) increase supply, (2) 
decrease demand or (3) solve the creditworthy status of the ISO or the 
utilities. So, why are we spending time on it?

Here are some of my thoughts:

Power price strip.  The power prices pulled together from the Davis-Lay 
meeting are based on a weighted average of off- and on-peak prices.  We can 
easily show on- and off-peak prices  separately.  We're making a FERC filing 
on Tues showing l-t prices so we can pull peak/off peak from that data.  
Note, however, that ""baseload"" power is equivalent to 24x7x365 power, which 
is what we provided him.

In terms of my other reactions:

Not enough DSM.  The best analysis of the West trading desk is that we are in 
a temporary, WSCC-wide energy shortage, not a capacity shortage.  Anything 
that reduces kWh demand will leave more water behind dams and natural gas 
storage.  This will translate into lower market prices.  Until more natural 
gas supply, generating capacity, and rainfall comes along, we will see high 
prices.  If Davis is unwilling to raise rates, he should be willing to take 
some extraordinary measures to cut demand.  At a minimum, there should be 
expanded pay-for-curtailment curtailment programs.

Voluntary Opt Out of Rate Freeze  I have not thought through all the EES 
implications but one thing that could be ""sold"" to customers is to give them 
the option of buying an interval meter and pay the current market price of 
power.  That would empower them to modify demand and not incur ongoing, 
increasing stranded cost liability.

Muni's need to get involved.  I assume that Enron won't take a position on 
requiring muni's to sell generation in California but Enron should support 
having muni's be cajoled to participate in demand reduction programs for the 
reasons noted above.  As recently as 12/23 Freeman said there was no need to 
conserve at LADWP.  Pretty irresponsible.

Tie Govt Backings with Move to Cost-Based Prices.  Securitization and state 
credit guarantees are great ways to lower the cost of money to the utilties 
in this crisis.  However, both are irresponsible actions unless there is  a 
plan to move retail rates to a level that covers the full cost of power.

A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  
Here are the main points from their conversation

1. Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt

Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with 
confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they 
hadn't already.""  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that 
""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest 
equity holders were screaming not to do it.""

He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are 
""speculative"" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they 
thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the 
bankruptcy court.""

2. Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough

Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power 
for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only 
reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the 
market could handle.""  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average 
peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the 
difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State 
Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.

3. New Generator Construction

Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority 
(authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop

We need to make some decisions very soon (this morning) about Enron's submission of data into the Pacific Northwest (""PNW"") refund case.  The data is due at FERC no later than Thursday August 16.

The key strategic issues in submitting the data to the ALJ include the following --

1.	Do we exclude bookouts (ie, only physical transactions)?

It appears that other market participants intend to exclude bookouts.  EPMI should also exclude bookouts given that these transactions never went physical and hence are not appropriate to consider in this case.

2.	Do we provide only sales transactions or do we include our purchases?

The ALJ's Order allows parties to include purchases only if the selling party is not an intervenor in this case and hence, our purchase would not be included in the data.  The ALJ wants to limit the amount of data to be provided to ease the workload.  Our initial analysis of some data from other parties is that there will be transaction data irregularities and hence, we should provide all of our relevant sales and purchases.  By having the data in the case, we can dispute any inappropriate transaction and ensure that all of our purchases are included in the calculation of refunds.  This is key for Enron in that our primary defense is that Enron deserves refunds as a purchaser to offset any sales refund amount.

3.	Do we provide data for all 4 time blocks (through 24 hours, through 7 days, through one month, through 1 year)?

The ALJ's Order indicates that parties are to provide data for transactions that are not consistent with the initial definition of ""spot"" - deals less than 24 hours done day ahead or day of.  Our initial recommendation is to provide the data but to retain our arguments that this is not consistent with FERC's Order.  The primary downside of not complying with this element of the data submission request is that we anger the ALJ and end up providing the data anyway after being told directly to comply.  In addition, it is possible that by providing all of the data we could be creating the problem that some economist or competitor could get their hands on the data at a later date and ""determine"" our trading strategies.  Weighing these risks, I would still recommend to include this data but argue before the ALJ and the FERC the ultimate relevance.

4.	Do we provide data based on contract date? 

The ALJ has requested data for contracts that were valid on December 25, 2000 that had physical energy flowing after December 25, 2000 through June 20, 2001.  This would explicitly include Balance of the Month transactions for December 2000 and the associated physical flows. To minimize the hours on these transactions, we intend to enter the transaction date in the data submission to allow for FERC staff to delete inappropriate transactions.

I will call you this morning.

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

NRC Approves Yucca Mountain as Nuclear Waste Site=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) signed off=
 on a plan to build an underground dump in Nevada's Yucca Mountain to hold =
radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants. Yet another step in a lon=
g approval process, the NRC approved a site suitability study submitted by =
the Department of Energy (DOE). The Bush administration must still submit t=
hat plan for congressional approval. The DOE in August gave a favorable saf=
ety assessment to the proposed project, which may face an uphill battle on =
Capitol Hill. It is heavily opposed by Democrat Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, =
the new Senate assistant majority leader.=20

Analysis: This is a major step toward establishing Yucca Mountain as the na=
tion's repository for spent nuclear fuel, but the NRC approval of the site =
could be blocked by the pending vote in Congress. Since Sept. 11, new secur=
ity issues certainly have been unearthed that may give legislators in Washi=
ngton, D.C. pause, and support ongoing efforts to block the site. Neverthel=
ess, after a decade of study, planning commissions and public debate, the N=
RC vote clearly represents the strongest endorsement of the Yucca Mountain =
site and could very well be an indication of how federal policymakers will =
side on the issue.=20

For background, since the dawn of the nuclear age one generally accepted be=
lief is that the most feasible and safest way to dispose of highly radioact=
ive materials is to store them deep underground. From this starting point, =
the United States passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in 1982 and charged t=
he DOE with finding an appropriate spot in which radioactive materials coul=
d be stored. From the beginning, it was understood that the NRC would need =
to give approval to the location selected by the DOE and that congressional=
 approval would also be necessary. In 1983, the DOE selected nine locations=
 in six states for consideration as possible depositories, and at that time=
 President Reagan approved only three of the nine locations for intensive s=
cientific study (known as site characterization). The three locations were:=
 Hanford, Wash.; Deaf Smith County, Texas; and Yucca Mountain, Nev. In 1987=
, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed the DOE to onl=
y study Yucca Mountain as a suitable location, based on the finding from th=
e earlier report. In other words, since that time no other location besides=
 Yucca Mountain has even been considered as a potential repository for nucl=
ear waste in the United States.=20

The issue is critical because storage capacity for the waste from nuclear e=
nergy and weapons has become increasingly limited. The Bush administration'=
s national energy plan, released last April, demonstrated strong support fo=
r the use of nuclear power as a supplement to more traditional fuel sources=
. Thus, the amount of nuclear waste in the country could increase considera=
bly in the near future, and the location of an acceptable repository has be=
come a top priority for the federal government.=20

What makes Yucca Mountain the preferred location? According to the vast amo=
unt of research compiled over the last decade, there are several characteri=
stics that arguably make Yucca Mountain the most appropriate repository sit=
e: it is a remote location and a long distance from a large population (100=
 miles from Las Vegas); it is located in a very dry climate, with less than=
 six inches of water per year; and, the location offers an extremely deep w=
ater table (800 to 1,000 feet below the level of the potential repository).=
 In addition, Yucca Mountain is located on federal land near the Nellis Air=
 Force Range and the Nevada Test Site, where atomic-bomb tests once took pl=
ace. Thus, it is considered a very secure area. Based on these characterist=
ics, over the last 14 years scientists have generally concluded that Yucca =
Mountain is capable of isolating spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioact=
ive waste.=20

Under the evolving plan, the site reportedly would store underground thousa=
nds of tons of radioactive materials from the nation's nuclear plants for a=
n estimated 10,000 years. Yucca Mountain originally was scheduled to be use=
d as the repository by 1998, but a delay in feasibility studies caused that=
 date to be extended several times. It is presently expected that, assuming=
 the site gains all the necessary approvals, Yucca Mountain would be used a=
s a repository starting in 2010.=20

However, while scientists may have been generally in agreement, reaching co=
nsensus among the other involved parties has been more difficult. From a fe=
deral perspective, President Bush and Vice President Cheney have supported =
the use of Yucca Mountain as a national repository. This belief has been sh=
ared by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. However, Nevada state leaders hav=
e demonstrated fierce resistance toward the use of Yucca Mountain for the s=
torage of nuclear waste, which has caused state / federal conflicts for the=
 last several years. Specifically, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn and the Nevada A=
ttorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa have said that they are opposed to usi=
ng Yucca Mountain as a repository and reportedly believe that the entire is=
sue should be put onto the back burner indefinitely, considering the recent=
 national events.=20

Water permits became one major conflict between state and federal officials=
. In fact, the federal government sued Nevada after the state refused to is=
sue water permits that Yucca Mountain would need to operate. Nevada had gra=
nted water rights to the federal government, but only for the study purpose=
s and not the actual use of the site. The issue is still working itself thr=
ough various courts. The latest word is that an appeals panel said a federa=
l court should decide the case because the proposed dumpsite is authorized =
under federal law.=20

Those who oppose using Yucca Mountain as a repository have consistently out=
lined their concerns in public meetings. Basically, the top concern is that=
 the radiation from the nuclear waste could seep through groundwater and in=
to the aboveground environment. Yucca Mountain is reportedly located near a=
 fault line, which has exacerbated concerns that the ground covering the po=
tential repository could be subject to shifting. The location of Yucca Moun=
tain, while touted as an advantage for proponents of the plan, has also bee=
n used by opponents as an argument against the plan. Specifically, opponent=
s say that Yucca Mountain is too close to a commercial air corridor (locate=
d about 11 miles away), and that a large number of military flights routine=
ly cross over the site.=20

In addition, the events of Sept. 11 certainly have heightened concerns abou=
t potential targets for terrorist activity, and despite reassurances from s=
cientists that the site is secure, opponents believe that no site would be =
attack-proof. Another concern is the actual transport of nuclear waste from=
 various locations across the country to the proposed site at Yucca Mountai=
n. The federal government reportedly claimed that it would not be responsib=
le for the actual transport of nuclear materials to the Yucca Mountain site=
 because the transportation would be handled by private companies. Critics =
of the plan say that this creates an unacceptable vulnerability for the cou=
ntry.=20

The next step will be for Energy Secretary Abraham to review all of the pre=
viously obtained material and make a recommendation to President Bush about=
 whether or not the federal government should proceed with using the Yucca =
Mountain site. All indications have suggested that Secretary Abraham will s=
ide with scientists that Yucca Mountain is an appropriate site and, after n=
early two decades of study, the pros of using this site outweigh the potent=
ial risks.=20

Regardless of the ultimate decision, action on nuclear waste is necessary. =
The sources vary on their estimates of how much highly radioactive material=
 waste exists in the United States. However, if we take the range of estima=
tes, it would equate to a football field ranging from 15 to 20 feet deep. T=
hat estimate takes into account all high-level nuclear waste generated in t=
he United States since the start of a nuclear program in the 1950s. Compare=
d to other hazardous materials, the amount of nuclear waste generated per y=
ear is very small. In the United States, all of the nuclear plants produce =
about 30,000 tons of spent fuel a year, whereas 300 million tons of chemica=
l waste are generated per year.=20

770,"I was in India last week meeting with partners and we all agreed that the 
best thing to do to move ahead regarding the old unrecovered cash calls 
(""joint interest billings"") was to file an arbitration proceeding and get an 
objective  third party to settle the issue.  As you know, Reliance and ONGC 
owe EOGIL approximately  $7.1 and $10.3 million, respectively (including 
interest on non-payment).  The arbitration notices reflected only the 
non-payment numbers which are $5.8 and $7.3 million for RIL and ONGC 
respectively.   We finalized the drafting and dated the notices on July 29th 
and we delivered the official notice during business hours Monday July 31, 
2000.  This was the final step in a very long effort to resolve this issue in 
other means, but as I noted to the OOC after the June meetings this was the 
only solution in the end.   While nobody likes to file arbitration, the good 
news is in the end all parties seen this as the only solution and as best as 
I can tell, at least internally ONGC and Reliance support this decision.  If 
the issue gets external, I don't know how any of the parties will respond.  
Our goal is to keep it as low keyed as possible, but this is India and I 
would expect someone to try to make a big issue out of it.

I will be in contact with John Ambler today to discuss the details of the 
submittal and to prepare for any response to the media that may be 
necessary.  While both parties were expecting the notice, it may leak into 
the media over the next few days.  Please defer any questions or comments to 
either John Ambler, Larry Morse or myself regarding this issue.  Until John 
advises us otherwise, our comment will be as follows;

"" The parties (ONGC, Reliance and Enron Oil and Gas India Limited) have had a 
dispute on certain cost items and together we have agreed it is best for the 
joint venture to have this dispute resolved by an independent third party 
using the guidelines as set forth in the Joint Operating Agreement.""

Mike Smalling in our office will coordinate this matter with John Ambler and 
the appropriate staff.   I will be available to respond if necessary and my 
contact numbers are as follows;

on this and any other official E&P business in India and Wade/Sanjay would 
you share this note with the appropriate people in your office so nobody is 
surprised if something comes up.  Mike Smalling, John and/or I will keep you

You may also want the following  additional information:

Dynegy may terminate the merger agreement if there has been a breach by Enron of any of its representations, warranties (such that there would be a Material Adverse Effect), covenants or agreements (in all material respects) set forth in the merger agreement and such breach is not curable, or, if it is curable, is not cured within 30 days after written notice of such breach is given by Dynegy to Enron.

Note, the merger deal may not occur for certain fiduciary duty reasons - say for a superior proposal.  I would not at all get into this area; note that there are ""no-shop"" provisions, that prohibit any encouragement of offers.  If asked, I would just refer anyone to the technical terms of the merger agreement.

In any event, I would tell people that the discussion of the merger agreement is qualified to the terms of the merger agreement, a copy of which will be filed with the SEC under a Form 8-K, first thing in the morning.

Good morning.  

As a follow up to the voice mail that I left for you, following are some 
background and preparatory notes for a potential phone call today between 
Chancellor Reed and yourself.  Communications and indications from the UC/CSU 
team are that he may call you today as a follow up to your discussion with 
him on February 2, 2001.  As I mentioned at the Executive Committee meeting 
on Tuesday, 2/20/01, all things are moving along well in California with our 
clients, PG&E and SCE.  The current exception to the ""smooth sailing"" is 
UC/CSU.  Tom Riley, the account manager for UC/CSU, has prepared the 
following outline of business concerns, sequence of events and suggested 
talking points.

Ken, thank you for your assistance and continued participation with this 
client.

Regards - Dan



******************************************************************************
*********************
Business Concerns

UC and CSU have business concerns regarding Enron's action to De-DASR their 
accounts.  They have not communicated their concerns with enough detail that 
would allow us to address them, but I have been able to surmise that they 
consist of the following:

1.  UC/CSU is now a bundled access customer instead of a direct access 
customer.  AB-1X, recently signed by Gov. Davis, has ban language preventing 
large commercial/industrial customers from going Direct Access.  Per Jeff 
Dasovich of Enron Gov. Affairs, it is not clear, but possible, that if we had 
not De-DASRed the accounts, that UC/CSU might have been grandfathered as a 
direct access customer.  Further, SB-27X (still pending), which is Senator 
Bowen's attempt to reverse the ban language of AB-1X, may have a financial 
ramification for customers switching to and from Direct Access status.  
Dasovich is investigating further.

2.  UC and CSU bought approximately 130 meters from Enron as we implemented 
the contract.  Our action is forcing the utility to remove these 
University-owned meters, meaning that their meters will become useless.  We 
are currently using those meters to provide daily 15 minute interval data as 
required in our contract. (Our operations and billing group have come up with 
a transition plan that SCE has agreed to. SCE would install dual-sockets 
allowing for the installation of the SCE meter, while keeping our meter in 
tact, mitigating their concern.  At this point, UC and CSU are not listening 
to our business solutions so we have not received feedback from them on this 
solution).

3.  We have a contractual obligation to be the Universities scheduling 
coordinator (SC).  As a result of our action, we are no longer their SC.  
They are concerned this may inhibit our ability to act as their SC for their 
recent proposal to the ISO under the Demand Reduction Program.



Sequence of Events

February 1 - I informed the UC/CSU electricity oversight board leaders and 
contract administrators of Enron's decision.  I walked through the power 
point presentation.  They expressed no concerns at that point, and even 
expressed appreciation we were standing by our contract.  I sent the UC and 
CSU contract administrators the letter later that day advising them of our 
decision.

February 2 - Ken Lay called Chancellor Reed assuring the Chancellor that we 
will honor the contract.  I have since heard that this call was extremely 
well received and that the CSU campus VPs have been advised of the call and 
Ken's assurances that were communicated.  We offered the call to the UC 
President as well, but were channeled to his SVP.  By the time I made contact 
with the SVPs administrator, we had begun receiving letters (below), so I 
backed off on arranging the call.

February 5 - UC and CSU contract administrators inform us they have been 
speaking to their regulatory advisor and asked for some clarifications.  
Maureen Palmer and I speak to the contract administrators and answer their 
questions.  

February 8/9 - UC and CSU send letters to their PG&E and SCE account managers 
advising them they have concerns regarding Enron's decision, and that they 
(PG&E and SCE) should only De-DASR on the Universities' request.

February 12 - I received a letter from the UC/CSU contract administers asking 
for clarifications regarding our action, and requesting we re-DASR their 
accounts.

February 14 - I responded with a letter providing them with responses to 
their clarification questions, but did not offer to re-DASR their accounts as 
they had requested.

February 16 - UC informed me they were unhappy we did not comply with their 
request to re-DASR and indicated they would be sending another letter.  I 
suspect this letter will express potential legal recourses.

February 20 - CSU and UC informed they would hold off on the letter pending 
outcome of a call between Chancellor Reed and Ken Lay.

Throughout the entire process, I have been asking that the business 
administrators meet with us so Enron can hear their concerns.  I gather CSU 
would like to do this, however, UC is more inclined to write letters and seek 
legal remedies.



Suggested Talking Points for Call and Desired Outcome


1.  We were faced with a difficult business decision, and made our California 
decision with our customers in mind.  We have kept our contracts in tact.  
Other energy service providers have left the market and their customers.

2.  We are an energy outsourcing company.  We should source supply from the 
""best available"" source in the marketplace. We feel we have a contractual 
right to have made the decision.

3.  Desired outcome is that we want to sit down with the University business 
administrators to listen to and address their concerns.  We have not been 
afforded this opportunity to date though we have offered.  However, the 
Chancellor needs to understand we are not willing to re-DASR their accounts 
in the meantime.



I will be available for the debrief with Ken if desired.  I can be reached at 
925-543-3703 (office), or 925-548-0326 (mobile) if you have any questions.

Regards, Tom

is your idea of the perfect vacation, Costa Rica is the place

Fix your mix

In volatile markets like this one, sectors behave in radically different
ways. Here's what you need to know to find today's best opportunities.

By Michael Sivy

When the economy is purring along, most stock groups rise and fall
together. But amid uncertainty and turmoil, different groups suffer at
different times and rebound with varying delays. That's what's been
happening this year, and investors preparing for 2001 need to examine each
sector independently to find the best bargains and to minimize risk.

Since January, there have been three big divergences in the market. The
first has been between tech stocks and defensive groups. The second has
been between issues with high P/Es and those with low P/Es. And the third
has been between companies with big market capitalizations and those with
small caps.

After many months of leadership, tech stocks peaked in March and have
declined as evidence of an economic slowdown accumulated. Technology
companies began warning that their earnings might fall short in upcoming
quarters, and the entire sector suffered as money managers and individual
investors began reducing their exposure. By Thanksgiving, even the
strongest and most popular tech stocks, including Cisco and Oracle, were
down a third or more from their highs. And even at current levels the
stocks aren't cheap with P/Es as high as 50. They'll be vulnerable to
further declines until it's clear that the economy has completed its 
downswing.

By contrast, consumer stocks (which are defensive because they aren't as
tied to economic cycles as tech stocks are) benefited from investors'
flight to safety. After having dropped by a third to less than $60 a share
in March, Procter & Gamble [PG] rebounded 35 percent to $74. And
Anheuser-Bush [BUD] has rallied more than 70 percent over the same period
to $48. Those stocks are now trading at more than 20 times next year's
earnings, so they're no longer exceptionally cheap. But such defensive
issues may still be worth buying to balance a portfolio that has been
overloaded in tech.

Energy stocks have also benefited immensely as a defensive sector, but they
were helped even more by this year's sharp runup in the price of oil.
ExxonMobil [XOM], one of the most conservative international oil companies,
has gained 20 percent since March to $89 a share. I doubt, however, that
oil can remain above $30 a barrel for more than a year or two -- today's
high prices will bring on more supply and an economic slowdown could reduce
demand. As a result, I think energy stocks may have seen the best parts of
their gains.

While constrained supply has pushed up prices in the oil business,
oversupply has done the opposite in telecommunications. Fiercely
competitive phone companies have overbuilt their networks so much that they
have been undercutting each other on pricing and cutting back on further
equipment purchases. The result is that stocks throughout the sector --
from service providers like AT&T [T] and WorldCom [WCOM] to equipment
manufacturers like Lucent [LU] -- have lost more than half their value
since the spring. Statistically, I think stocks in the group are
undervalued by a third, but they still may represent dead money for the
next six months.

These divergences among industry sectors are the most visible symptom of
the roiling market, but they aren't the only one. The largest U.S.
companies have average P/Es in the mid-20s, and the most popular giants
have P/Es double or nearly triple historical levels. By contrast, small
companies -- those with market caps of less than $3.5 billion -- have
average P/Es of below 18.

 From all these cross-currents, two important ideas emerge. At any point
there's likely to be at least one sector that's deeply undervalued. Don't
try to predict the turns -- just buy one or two of the blue chips in the
sector that looks cheapest. Right now, defensive stocks are still in an
uptrend but they're no longer cheap, while the techs are still falling
(their decline isn't over yet). You can either buy good tech values and
ride out any further decline or wait until they look fully washed out. The
other important idea is that high-P/E blue-chip growth stocks are way
overvalued compared with everything else. Of course, those are the stocks
everyone most wants to own. But be smart -- diversify with a value fund or
a fund that holds mid- and small-caps with an average P/E below 20. They're
out there.

794,"Austin, TX (Dec. 4)--Attorneys for Texas Governor George W. Bush filed suit
in federal court today, seeking to prevent Santa Claus from making his list
and then checking it twice.  The complaint seeks an immediate injunction
against the beloved Christmas icon, asking the court to
effectively ban his  traditional practice of checking the list of good boys
and girls one  additional time before packing his sleigh.

The suit filed in Federal District Court in Austin, asks a federal judge to
""hereby order
Mr. Claus to cease and desist all repetitive and duplicative  list-checking
activity, and certify the original list as submitted without  amendment,
alteration, deletion, or other unnecessary modification."":   There are no
standards for deciding who is naughty, and who is nice.  It's  totally
arbitrary and capricious.  How many more time does he need to check?  This
checking, checking and re-checking over and over again must stop now,""  said
former Secretary James Baker

Baker further claimed that unnamed GOP observers witnessed an elf remove all
boys named Justin from the 'nice' list, filing them under 'naughty' instead
because ""everyone knows all boys named Justin are brats.""    Gov. Bush cited
the potential for unauthorized list tampering, blasted what  he called the
""crazy, crazy mess up there at the North Pole.""    ""Their security is really
awful, really bad,"" said Bush.  ""My mother just  walked right in, told 'em
she was Mrs. Claus.  They didn't check her ID or  nothing.""

Meanwhile, Dick Cheney, issued a direct plea to St. Nick himself.  ""Mr.
Claus, I call on you to do the honorable thing, and quit checking your list.
The children of the world have had enough.  They demand closure now."" Cheney
said, adding that his granddaughter has already selected a name for the pony
she's asked for.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson was quick to respond to the latest development with
plans to lead his protesters from Florida to the North Pole via dogsled. The
""Million Man Mush!"" is scheduled to leave Friday.  ""We need red suits and
sleighs, not law suits and delays,"" Jackson said.

Santa Claus could not be reached for comment, but spokeself said he was
""deeply distressed"" by news of the pending legal action against him. ""He's
losing weight, and he hasn't said 'Ho Ho Ho' for days,"" said the spokeself.
""He's just not feeling jolly."" ","George W. Bush Claus James Baker Baker Justin Bush Dick Cheney Cheney

803,"It was just brought to my attention by Dave Steiner that the Estate will continue to own the F(urniture), F(ixtures), and E(quipment) and that UBS will be able to use it for free so long as we are in this building.

As you both know, it is possible that we will move from this floor and would like to take a good portion of the FFE with us.  My understanding is that Enron is leasing the furniture in Houston and owns the furniture in Portland.  Therefore, it makes sense for the Houston office to continue to use the furniture but not move it.  It doesn't make as much sense here as it will be expensive for the Estate to dispose of the furniture here and it will be even more expensive to move it to sell it.

Here's the issue -- the Estate should convey the furniture in Portland to UBS.  Is this possible?  What do we need to do to make this happen?",Dave Steiner,,Estate UBS FFE Enron

EnronOnline started to see message delivery slow down drastically at 8:40am.  At 8:50 updates were so slow that all products were suspended from trading.  At 8:56 we brought the site offline to insure that trading would NOT continue, as our traders could not manage their products.

At 9:10 we were able to isolate the issue to a single disk, in a brick of storage, that was responding extremely slowly, but not failing over like it should.  We removed the storage from the configuration and brought the database back online.  Once we verified the database was healthy we brought EOL back online at approximately 9:28am.  At this point all our users, both internal and external, started logging back in.

The issue was caused by a bug in the firmware on the disk.  The vendor of the disk has already provided us with a patch for this bug.  We will be applying this patch to all of our storage, one brick at a time starting this evening.

We had to take EOL offline for a second time at 11:17am due to a failure on another brick of storage.  This failure was caused while we were verifying the root cause of the issue we experienced earlier.  We brought the site back online at 11:56.  During this outage we verified that there was NO corruption or loss of data, due to either of the outages.

Enron Discusses Credit Line of $1 Billion to $2 Billion With Banks
By Jathon Sapsford and John Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp., scrambling to restore confidence in its finances, is negotiati=
ng with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion, a=
nd is likely to close a deal within days, according to officials familiar w=
ith the matter.=20
The new credit line is intended to bolster Enron's financial condition and =
head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence=
. The new credit would supplement existing lines, which are largely tapped =
out after Enron last week drew down about $3 billion to increase cash reser=
ves and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets.
An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit l=
ine, but said he couldn't supply any further details.=20
Houston-based Enron is the nation's biggest energy trader and a principal i=
n nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favo=
rite of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convi=
ncing a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, i=
ts finances remain sound.=20
Confidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier th=
is month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 b=
illion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions =
it had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, An=
drew Fastow.=20
Last week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Excha=
nge Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consisten=
tly said that the transactions were proper and legal.=20
Enron's stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading o=
n the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. E=
nron shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a S=
ept. 18, 2000, high of $89.63.=20
Late last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that m=
oney being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial p=
aper, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Stan=
dard & Poor's said he believes that Enron was ""getting a bit more resistanc=
e"" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enro=
n probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstandin=
g, he said.=20
The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and=
 still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on ha=
nd would give it more financial flexibility.=20
Also last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing=
 Enron's debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lowe=
r rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses.=20
Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor c=
onfidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last =
week could impair ""Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital mark=
ets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business.""=20
The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are =
doing business with Enron on ""essentially the same terms"" as they have in t=
he past. ""There has been no significant change in the credit conditions,"" h=
e said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron =
would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's f=
inances.=20
The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase=
 & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the n=
ew credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said.=20
Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to=
 show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. ""Confid=
ence in this company was lost,"" said one bank official involved in the nego=
tiations for a new credit line. ""But confidence will be restored.""=20
Corporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demons=
trate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have a=
ccess to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines.=
 Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illu=
strates the pressure Enron is feeling.

Manager's Journal: How Enron Ran Out of Gas
By Paul Kedrosky

10/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A22
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Is troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy mark=
ets, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too man=
y of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those a=
re the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial rele=
ases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern.=20
A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking=
, Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of=
 which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for=
 the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled.
Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron=
's revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No l=
onger. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenu=
es, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues =
and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and s=
elling stakes in energy producers.=20
The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at arou=
nd 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation =
than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke=
 Energy.=20
But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a ""new economy"" Web-ba=
sed energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. Ac=
cording to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be value=
d accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the compan=
y's stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its p=
rice then.=20
Then the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under stra=
nge circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in Califor=
nia's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial stat=
ements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic=
 scholars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's=
 troubles were hiding in plain sight.=20
It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure the=
re was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or=
 how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that=
 they really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad.=20
Not that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low r=
eturn on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came f=
rom asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from =
energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how=
 -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter.=20
Enron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the compan=
y filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership=
. According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a ""senior officer of Enron is the m=
anaging member"" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron ""ma=
nage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar asset=
s by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars."" It was=
, in a phrase, Enron's house hedge fund.=20
There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market=
 -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managin=
g and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially =
when the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he sev=
ered his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this yea=
r -- and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had bee=
n done.=20
As stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow's LJM partnershi=
p allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enro=
n relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion=
-dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM's wrong-foo=
ted hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission =
were left with many questions, and very few answers.=20
To be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a y=
ear ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow/LJM and the co=
mpany. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea =
that horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of =
the wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of =
which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003=
.=20
We didn't do anything wrong is Mr. Lay's refrain in the company's current r=
ound of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be se=
en, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and hero=
ic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial trans=
parency.=20
Where has Enron's board of directors been through all of this? What kind of=
 oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and r=
etired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. =
It is time Enron's board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house=
 -- perhaps neatly finishing with themselves.=20

876,"PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

I wanted to highlight my preliminary thoughts.  I suggest we get together so I can get a feel for where you want to go.

Objectives:

Primary objective is to avoid repayment of the principal Lenders prior to at least January 1, 2002.

Secondary objectives are (a) to avoid the Lenders being able to declare a default resulting in on-balance sheet treatment, and (ii) securing firm replacement financing from OPIC, but without risking the availability of the OPIC financing caused by a delay in Completion (I do not have good feel for this aspect of the matter yet, and need to pursue it with Ranabir Dutt when he returns from meeting with OPIC).

Primary Issues:

1.	Under the Construction Agency Agreement (CAA) can we (ESAT) state definitively that there will not be Completion before 	01/01/02?
2.	Is the current running of the Project, for commissioning and testing, risking an argument that there has been Completion?
3.	Can Completion be deferred without the Lenders declaring a default (Agent Event of Default) under the CAA , resulting in 	balance sheet obligations?

Other Issues:

4.	Can the timing of the availability of the OPIC financing be delayed to accommodate a deferral of Completion, without risking 	the firmness or availability of the OPIC financing, particularly in current capital markets?
5.	Are lost energy/capacity payments/revenues from deferring Completion a material commercial consideration?

The following deals only with items 1 -3.  As mentioned, I need to get a better feel for the OPIC side of things, and item 5 is a commercial matter.

Outside Payment Date:

As I understand it, the repayment obligation occurs upon the earlier of:

	(a)	Final Completion (as certified by ESAT) under the EPC Contract; or
	(b)	an Agent Event of Default; or
	(c)	the Maturity Date - August 31, 2002.

Alternative #1:  Deferring the activities of the EPC Contractor, including to stopping current testing operations, to ensure Completion does not occur this year.

The risk is the Lenders declaring an Agent Event of Default. This will also put some risk on the Lenders, however, for improperly declaring an Agent Event of Default for any of our resulting losses, noting:

(a)  Completion arguably means (although not entirely clear) Final Completion under the EPC Contract, requiring (i) Facility Substantial Completion (we need to confirm where we are on that); (ii) completion of the final punchlist; (iii) completion of all NEPCO clean-up and final documentation obligations; (iv) NEPCO receiving all releases and lien waivers (knowing the lien release requirements and timing are under applicable law is fundamental); and (iv) NEPCO satisfying all warranty and other obligations under the EPC Contract.  It is fundamental to determine if Final Completion is even a reality before year-end?

(b)  It is ESAT that certifies when Completion occurs.

(c)  Although there are obligations within the Scope of Authority under the CAA to take all Required Actions (Completion within the Budget and the Plans and Specifications) there is some scope or leeway for ESAT to unilaterally amend the Plans and Specifications, and thereby affect the timing for Completion, provided Completion occurs before August 31, 2001.  It may be too late  

(d)  An Agent Event of Default is subject to a 10-day curing period after notice.

(e)  The Termination Payment is due within a further 10 days after notice.

Alternative #2:  Deferring the process is not necessary.

The risk is that we may be moving the Project closer to Completion in the current year and/or an interpretation that the Project is in fact Complete, noting:

(a)  The definition of Completion under the CAA does not necessarily require Final Completion or even Facility Substantial Completion under the EPC Contract.  The test is more vague, and could be to a lower standard.  Noting this difference, and understanding the mood of the Lenders is fundamental. 

(b)  There is an obligation on ESAT to take the Required Actions under the CAA for Completion, as well as potential good faith obligations.      

(c)  The Project is currently operating (although as noted, apparently for testing and commissioning purposes).

(b)  We may still run the risk, in any event, of the Lenders declaring an Agent Event of Default.

Other Items to Consider:

916,"El Paso Open Season Was 'Rigged,' CPUC Says

Armed with a ""smoking gun"" discovered in just-released data, the California 
Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has launched a fresh offensive against El 
Paso Natural Gas' 1.22 Bcf/d transportation contract arrangement with 
affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. 

Based on information uncovered in an internal e-mail, the CPUC now contends 
that the open season last February for one third of El Paso's firm 
transportation capacity was ""rigged"" to show preference to El Paso Merchant. 

The e-mail revealed that during the open season El Paso Merchant had 
""secretly negotiated"" a two cents/MMBtu transportation discount rate on 
Mojave Pipeline, another El Paso affiliate, for service from Topock to 
Southern California Gas at Wheeler Ridge for quantities above 100,000 MMBtu/d 
effective March 1, 2000, the CPUC told FERC. The interruptible discount would 
last the entire 15 months of the new contracts offered in El Paso Natural 
Gas' open season, state regulators said, adding that Mojave had withheld 
announcing the discount until Feb. 18 ",,two cents,"El Paso Open Season the California

929,"Westcoast, Coastal Split Engage Energy Assets

To prepare for El Paso Energy's looming takeover of Coastal Corp., Westcoast 
Energy Inc. and Coastal are splitting up Engage Energy, their three-year-old 
marketing venture, with each retaining a half interest in the Houston-based 
gas marketer. The split should be completed by the end of the week. 

Coastal, headquartered in Houston, will merge with El Paso Energy in a $16 
billion deal by the end of the fourth quarter (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19), and 
company officials said that several transactions needed to be completed 
before the merger could be finalized, including dismantling the Engage 
venture. Vancouver-based Westcoast and Coastal each own 50% interest in 
Engage, which has 12 regional offices throughout North America and employs 
300. One of the top North American gas marketers, it purchases natural gas 
from every producing basin in North America, and trades electricity within 
all NERC regions. Engage estimates it will add another 1 Bcf/d to its natural 
gas deliverability by the end of this year. 

NGI ranked Engage in 12th place in its 1999 North American power marketers 
list, dropping from eighth place in 1998, losing about 15.2% in sales. Engage 
reported a sales volume of 5.6 Bcf/d last year, compared with 6.6 Bcf/d the 
previous year. It sold an estimated 2,100 Bcf of natural gas in 1999. 

Westcoast and Coastal formed Engage in 1997 to offer a full spectrum of 
energy services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity 
trading and sales, energy management services, structured storage and 
transportation-related services, structured power and management services and 
energy risk management services. The companies said that those services would 
continue as before. There is expected to be little impact on either company's 
existing asset valuation. 

Under the restructuring plan, Westcoast will retain the Engage Canadian 
business entity and certain natural gas and power activities in the United 
States. Westcoast also will retain the right to use the Engage Energy name 
and will continue to conduct business from Calgary, Southfield, MI and other 
U.S. locations. Coastal will retain the U.S. business entity, with 
headquarters in Houston. 

""By taking full ownership of our natural gas and electricity marketing and 
trading functions, we can better capitalize on the knowledge, experience, 
track record and infrastructure that we have built over the past three 
years,"" said Michael Phelps, Westcoast CEO. 

When Coastal merges with El Paso, it will be joining a company that already 
has a strong gas marketing arm. NGI ranked El Paso seventh on its list of gas 
marketers in 1999, noting that it traded 6.7 Bcf/d of natural gas last year. 
It also was ranked seventh in 1998.",Westcoast Michael Phelps,"$16

930,"UtiliCorp to Re-Acquire and Then Become Aquila 
UtiliCorp United announced plans to buy back the 20% of its trading and risk management arm, Aquila Inc., that it sold to the public earlier this year and adopt Aquila as its corporate name. The move is a strategic reversal apparently prompted by the weakening economy and industry changes. Executives dodged questions as to whether the move was spurred by the financial troubles at the energy industry's largest trading house, Enron Corp. 
On this busy Wednesday, UtiliCorp also released its earnings, and reported that it has entered into an acquisition agreement with a FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary. 
UtiliCorp said its board of directors voted to make an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common shares of its 80%-owned Aquila Inc. subsidiary due to the ""recent significant changes in the merchant energy sector, the general economy and the impact of these changes on the capital markets."" 
""The most significant influence, however, was the realization that greater shareholder value could be obtained by recombining the financial strength of UtiliCorp with the growth opportunities that lie ahead for Aquila,"" said Richard C. Green, Jr., chairman and CEO of UtiliCorp. ""With its larger asset base, earnings potential and cash flow, the combined company will have more efficient access to capital to execute its ambitious plans. Industry-watchers questioned whether some of the spark for the recombining of the trading operation with the hard-asset backed parent, could have been prompted by Enron's current debacle. 
When asked during the conference call if the Enron situation factored in the decision to combine UtiliCorp and Aquila, Robert Green said, ""The decision evolved over the recent few weeks as we evaluated the opportunities in front of Aquila, and the current conditions in the capital market. [We] effectively came to the conclusion that if we are going to put Aquila in a position to execute on these opportunities, it is essential that we recombine the businesses and the balance sheets to execute on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace that are precipitated by the decline in the capital markets, and the fact that the equity markets are shutdown."" 
""The merchant strategy behind Aquila's rapid growth has been a key driver behind UtiliCorp's achievement of aggressive earnings targets,"" Richard Green said. ""We decided that UtiliCorp shareholders would be better served by embracing the Aquila energy merchant strategy as the company's core strategy, rather than spinning the business off as a separate entity. To symbolize that change in thinking, we intend to adopt 'Aquila' as our corporate name after our exchange offer is completed."" The company said in its conference call that it expects to complete the reacquisition of Aquila by ""early January."" 
Richard Green also said he will take on a new role, effective Jan. 1, 2002, initially as chairman of UtiliCorp and later of the new company that will be formed from UtiliCorp United and Aquila, Inc. Robert K. Green, president and COO of UtiliCorp, will be elevated to president and CEO of the new Aquila. 
UtiliCorp said all public Aquila shareholders will be offered 0.6896 shares of UtiliCorp common stock in a tax-free exchange for each outstanding share of Aquila Class A common stock. Based on yesterday's closing price of $17.99 per share for Aquila Class A common stock and $30 per share for UtiliCorp common stock, the offer represents a value of $20.69 per Class A share of Aquila and a 15% premium to yesterday's closing price of those shares. ""Aquila shareholders will have the opportunity to continue to participate in Aquila's growth through their ongoing ownership of UtiliCorp shares, and to receive cash dividends as UtiliCorp shareholders,"" Richard Green said. 
The offer requires that at least a majority of Aquila's publicly held Class A shares are tendered. After successful completion of the exchange offer, UtiliCorp has committed to complete a 'short-form' merger of Aquila with a UtiliCorp subsidiary. In the merger, each remaining Aquila Class A share will be converted (subject to the exercise of appraisal rights) into the same number of shares of UtiliCorp common stock as are paid in the exchange offer. UtiliCorp plans to file its offering materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission and commence the exchange offer as soon as possible. 
""Over the past year, I have devoted an increasing amount of time and energy to raising other chief executives' awareness of Aquila's broad capabilities,"" Richard Green said. ""We have a unique position in the emerging market that is being created by the convergence of the insurance, capital and energy businesses, combining our expertise in risk management, wholesale energy, structured financing, generation assets and other related activities. We can help clients in countless industries in ways they've never thought of, and that opportunity is largely driving this change in executive roles."" 
The company also reported Wednesday that it expects to enter into an acquisition agreement with FirstEnergy Corp. under which UtiliCorp and a financial partner will purchase FirstEnergy's wholly owned Avon Energy Partners Holdings subsidiary, the holding company for Midlands Electricity plc. Midlands Electricity is the fourth-largest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom and serves 2.3 million network customers. UtiliCorp said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2002 after receipt of regulatory approvals. In the company's conference call, Robert Green said the acquisition would likely be ""strongly accretive"" in 2002. 
In releasing its earnings, UtiliCorp followed the strong third quarter results from its Aquila subsidiary and reported earnings per share for the third quarter 2001 were $0.58, up 16% from last year's third quarter after adjusting for the $0.30 gain from the 2000 initial public offering of Uecomm, Ltd. in Australia. The company posted earnings for the quarter of $68.9 million, a decrease from the $74.9 million mark for the same quarter of 2000. UtiliCorp said energy sales for the quarter were $9.3 billion, up 16% from $8 billion during the third quarter of 2000. 
""At Aquila, we continue to see increasing client demand for our risk management solutions,"" said Robert Green. ""In addition, our recent capacity acquisitions are performing beyond our expectations. Our network businesses continue to help fuel our core growth in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Combining that with the solid results from Aquila, UtiliCorp continues to be on track to deliver at least 15% earnings growth this year."" 
UtiliCorp CFO Dan Streek said during the conference call that the company expects 2001 EPS to be in the area of $2.95. The CFO added that this ""far exceeds"" the company's 15% growth target. For 2002 guidance, Streek said the combined EPS for UtiliCorp and Aquila would be around $2.92. 
Earnings before income taxes (EBIT) for the quarter UtiliCorp were led by strong contributions from Aquila as well as the international business segment. Aquila's operations increased from $40.8 million to $44.2 million (net of minority interests of $7.4 million) in the 2001 third quarter, marking a 26% increase. UtiliCorp attributed some of Aquila's growth to the fact that gas and power commodity markets are slowing down, forcing Aquila's clients to focus more on risk and how they can minimize exposure. As a result, Aquila has seen an increase in its client-focused businesses. Additionally, Aquila's December 2000 acquisition of interests in six power plants through its purchase of GPU International have provided stronger-than-expected operating results. 
The company reported that gas trading volumes in the third quarter increased 11%, from 12.1 Bcf/d during the third quarter 2000 to 13.4 Bcf/d. Power volumes increased 98%, from 44 million MWh to 87 million MWh. 
EBIT from international networks increased 57% to $48.5 million from $30.9 million in the 2000 third quarter, excluding last year's gain of $44 million or $.30 per share from the initial public offering of Uecomm, Ltd. The company said EBIT from Canada and Australia increased, primarily due to the full quarter contribution of electric properties in Alberta, purchased on Aug. 31, 2000, and strong performance in Australia related to continued strength in the United Energy business and the addition of AlintaGas, which was purchased in October 2000. 
In the United States, UtiliCorp's networks had EBIT of $47.4 million in the third quarter of 2001, compared to $45.3 million in the 2000 period. The company said the contribution from the St. Joseph Light & Power division, acquired at the end of 2000, was partially offset by higher operating costs.

Don't worry.  Our printed newsletter isn't going anywhere; it's still the

for fast-breaking news about and around Enron.  It's called eBiz, and it will 
change the way you get news.  It might even change the way you think about 
news.  

eBiz will come racing across the Enron intranet on home.enron.com every two 
weeks, and we will post breaking news and announcements as they happen.  The

are also working on one for ANR.  The purpose was so Marketing could

 ",,,
1000,"Stuart:

Yes.  My view of the remaining activities is as follows:

 #1. We (Mark Gershon/Karen Way/myself) are currently working with the 
Village of Manhattan to fufil our obligation under the Annexation Agreement 
to complete certain roadway improvements.  The Village has conducted a bid 
process and selected a winning bidder to complete the work.  Unfortunately, 
no bidders submitted a fixed price bid to the Village.  The Village wants us 
to assume the financial risk (up to $500k) of any cost overruns.  We have 
pointed out that the annexation Agreement does not require us to assume that 
risk.  We are attempting to work this situation out with the Village.

 #2. Karen Way is working with Chicago Title to bring to closure the issues 
related to the pipeline lateral easements and obtain the title policy on the 
entire lateral.  It was recently brought to our attention that during the 
pipeline's construction the lateral was routed across a piece of People's 
Energy property without an easement being executed.  The pipeline project 
manager (Dave Lazzarro is currently working to obtain this easement).  

Stuart:  Can you confirm for Karen/myself if the Northern Border easement was 
recorded?

 #3. Mark/myself are working with the Village and the plant manager on these 
issues.  There are only a couple of improvements still remaining to be 
completed including a ditch being re-graded and possibly a road re-graded 
with gravel.  This should represent a small time commitment to close out.

 #4.  Mark/myself are working with the Village on this issue.  We have 
notified our surveyor of our need to prepare platts of dedication for the two 
roadways bordering the project site.  The first one to be completed should be 
Pauling road since that is the roadway that issue #1 relates to (the project 
owns to the middle of the roadway - we do not wish construction workers 
working on our property and creating any potential liability).

 #5.  There are no current plans for expansion of the facility, so this item 
should require negligible work.  We have filed an air permit application for 
an additional 7FA turbine at the Project, but this is just to allow for 
expansion if we choose to do so.  The annexation Agreement allows us to 
expand the facility without any additional local approvals.

Additional:  I have had discussions with Merle Churchill (plant manager) 
regarding the potential purpose of an 8 acre parcel nearby.  Merle has been 
approached by a local electrical contractor who would like to relocate his 
shop out to the county.  This 8 acre parcel would be ideal and would allow us 
to close out a potential sound receptor necessary for the expansion turbine.  
Also, the potential need for a special use permit for the generator lead 
needs to be evaluated.  I will talk with Mark Gershon on this issue.  If we 
decide to proceed, then this would likely be a 3-4 month project, similar to 
what we completed on the facility last year.

In general, I am working to wrap up Piper Rudnick's(PR) work on the Lincoln 
Energy Center ASAP.  With regard to other Illinois development sites (Pontiac 
and Plano),  I have tried to keep the majority of the work to Mark Gershon 
and Karen Way.  There have been some cases where others were needed and I 
have tried to limit their roles to very short, specific engagements 
(environmental, sound, real estate).  I met with Chris Townsend 3 weeks ago 
and stressed our desire to have Mark and Karen handling the majority of the 
development work (in my opinion, they are the best and most productive uses 
of personnel at PR).  The rapid speed of our development activities at Plano 
and Pontiac have required them to take on very integrated roles.  This pushes 
the costs up but also is a big part of our successes, thereby eliminating the 
need to re-complete numerous stages of the lengthy zoning process which exist 
in Illinois counties.  Having said that, we need to watch PR and their 
charges closely as they have a tendency to want to involve additional people 
into our development activities.

Call me to discuss.

previously had such authority as General Manager (she is a VP at ENA).  If 
she now becomes the Board Member, can she also sign on behalf of enovate?  If

be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become 
standard at ENA.

description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The 
responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve 
such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide 
substantial professional services.

 2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised

$25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by 
the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee 
before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional

Ben, Steve and I have had a couple of discussions, and we have agreed that on a going forward basis, I will need to be involved in all strategy decisions and decisions impacting our legal fees.  Obviously, this does not go to the point of needing permission to handle to routine matters, but does involve needing approval before engaging in legal research, preparing motions and conducting discovery.  It is Enron's policy to enforce this by disallowing any fees and expenses not approved in advance.  I know it sounds harsh, but I believe it is workable given the team we have working for us.

provision that seems to capture what I was concerned about.  I have included 
the ARCOS provision below for everyone's review.  Some of the defined terms 
do not match, but.....


14.18.2.2 If the corrections to reduce a Shortfall are completed before the 
Power Island achieves Acceptance and:
(i) such corrections are made and are complete prior to commercial operation 
of the Station, and
(ii) such corrections cause a reduction in the performance Shortfall
then Purchaser shall:
(a) refund to Seller an amount equal to the Performance Liquidated Damages 
associated with such reduction in the Shortfall, and/or 
(b) reduce the offset associated with such reduced Shortfall; however, such 
reduction in offset or amount of refund shall not exceed the amount actually 
offset (payment withheld) in accordance with Clause 30.8 or paid in 
accordance with Clause 14.15 for such Shortfall.
14.18.2.3 If the corrections to reduce a Shortfall are completed after the 
Power Island achieves Acceptance, and such corrections are completed within 
one hundred eighty (180) days after the Power Island achieved Acceptance, and 
such corrections cause a reduction in the performance Shortfall, then 
Purchaser shall:
(a) refund to Seller an amount equal to the Performance Liquidated Damages 
associated with such reduction in the Shortfall, and/or 
(b) reduce the offset associated with such reduced Shortfall;
however, such refund of Performance Liquidated Damages or reduction of offset 
will not exceed the amount actually offset in accordance with Clause 30.8 or 
paid in accordance with Clause 14.15 for such Shortfall and the amount of 
such refund or reduction of offset shall itself be reduced by the following 
amounts for each day that passes from date of the Performance Test on which 
the Performance Liquidated Damages were originally based upon until the date 
that Seller demonstrated the improved performance:
(c) At a rate of $0.23/day for each kW that the Net Electrical Output 
Shortfall of the Power Island is reduced (the ""Output Liquidated Damages 
Refund Reduction"").
(d) At a rate of $45.00/day for each kj/kWh that the Net Heat Rate Shortfall 
of the Power Island is reduced (the ""Heat Rate Liquidated Damages Refund 
Reduction"").
14.18.2.4 No refund of Performance Liquidated Damages shall be made if the 
corrections are made after one hundred eighty (180) days after Acceptance of 
the Power Island, unless Purchaser elects to do so as a result of the 
corrective action plan presented by Seller prior to the expiry of such one 
hundred eighty (180) day period.  In the event Seller determines the cause of 
a portion or all of the Shortfall prior to the expiry of the one hundred 
eighty (180) day period following Acceptance, but in spite of its reasonable 
efforts is not able to effect the necessary corrections to the Plant, Seller 
may present a correction plan that extends beyond such one hundred and eighty 
(180) day period. Purchaser, at its sole discretion, may elect to permit 
Seller the opportunity to make such corrections.",Arcos Shortfall,0.23 45.00,"Section ARCOS Performance Liquidated Damages the Performance Test kj/kWh the

Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it, however, 
we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the extra wood 
package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we asked for a 
price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.  They offered 
to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.  When we priced 
these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the wood package 
instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount the options by a 
third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get reasonable over these 
options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to ""work on it"".  The fellow 
you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.

I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my Lexus.

1. Development fee is a commercial question.  This will need to be vetted 
with Herman if we go with it.  Personally, I'd skip it and push to sign next 
week.

2.  I have a call in to Dale.

3.  No LLC.  Kathleen will handle.  The closer the creation is to the signing 
of the letter, the better, taking into account the time required to get the 
docs back and set up.  Someone needs to name it.  We should also look at a 
minimal list of officers.

4.  I don't have the attachment in front of me, so I will have to look it 
up.  I'll get back to you.  The concept is that ENA is only responsible for 
changes in the amounts owed to GE as of the closing date.  I thought the 
language was awkward, and tried to make it more clear, but obviously failed!  
As soon as I get the break out contract from Dale we can check on the 
definitional questions. It SHOULD be the same as in the CA breakout contract 
with GE, but I won't make that assumption.  Drop dead date on put/call Dec.

5. This needs to be discussed with Ben.

available in Houston starting the afternoom of 14 June and continuing through 
about end-June for PRC's and to discuss and finalize the Pacific Basin LNG 
strategy and organization issues that we highlighted when you were in Korea.  
As we discussed in Korea, I believe that if we intend to develop a Pacific 
Basin LNG business, (including the US west coast), we need to define and 
articulate a vision and strategy to the LNG group by the end of June or we 
risk having our Pacific team members drift away to our competitors.

There is a lot happening in the Pacific and our key people are well known and 
well thought of.  There is a genuine feeling within the team at this time 
that Enron's LNG focus is on North America/Atlantic basin and that there is 
little top management support for the commitment of time and resources to 
build a more global business.  

I'd like to set up a meeting with you to discuss this, preferably on 21 or 22 
June (i.e., right after the PRC reviews).  I need some advance warning on a 
date because I want Clay and Wayne to be there and they both have a heavy

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

How are you doing?  I know I have been delinquent in sending you a note but=
 there has been a lot going on these days.  The move still is not quit comp=
lete, I still have things I need to do up there and I probably need to do a=
 weekend trip to get everything cleaned up.  I ended up selling you curio (=
sp?) cabinets and keeping you TV. cabinet.  Hence I have a cheque for you t=

ame as your basement in Summerland.  Nothing major got damaged, in the move=
 so that helps.  I still have to switch over my car registration and insura=
nce, and we all know how much fun that is so I've been procrastinating.

I've done a couple of fun things since being down here.  I've gone to two c=
ollege football games, one at College Station to watch Texas A&M beat Notre=
 Dame, and one in Austin to watch the University of Texas beat Colorado.  T=
hey were both day trips about two and a half hours from Houston, so the dri=
ves were not that bad.  Its just kind of neat to be in a Stadium with 90,00=
0 other fans.  It is truly amazing to hear the noise that can be made by th=
at many people.  Two weekends ago I watched the Texaco Grand Prix of Housto=
n.  This is a car race similar to the ones they have in Vancouver and Toron=
to each year.  There are two Canadian drivers in this racing series but bot=
h of them had a bad day.  One of them crashed and the other finished way ba=
ck.  The highlight was that Enron had sponsored a car just for that race th=
at was doing very well up until the second from last lap when it crashed.  =
Oh well, at least it was fun to have some one to cheer for, and it was a pr=
etty nice day to sit out side and drink a beer.

Work is hard and not going as well as I hoped, but I think I just need to g=
ive it some time.  Enron also has been in the news a lot these days for all=
 the wrong reasons.  It sounds like one of the ""way high-ups"" had a questio=
nable kick back deal with Enron that has come under attack.  The Board of D=
irectors has been sued by shareholders and all the regulatory people are st=
arting to ask questions now.  It looks like my plan for early retirement is=
 out the window as our stock price this year has fallen from a high of $90 =
to $25.  So much for getting stock options as your bonus.

Anyway, the World Trade attacks have not really changed much down here.  Th=
ere seems to be more hype than anything else, you know anything the media c=
an latch its teeth into rip apart.  I'm actually getting tired of all the r=
umors and fear mongering that is going on.  I figure if my time is up, than=
 so be it, but I'm not going to spend all day worrying about it, its a wast=
e of energy.

I hope the new job goes well.  I'm glad to hear that your back working, I w=
as starting to worry about you a little.  You know what can happen when peo=
ple lock themselves in their house and don't get out enough they tend to st=

Please see the message below from Neil Davies.  Neil works in HR under David 
Oxley and was instructed to call Mr. Reitze last night.  I asked him not to 
mention the dinner with you.  A problem that is coming up is that the 
interviews are required to run late (8:30ish) and the person that has been 
pushed to the end of that line is Hunter.  What are your thoughts on this and 
is him going to dinner with the two of you a possibility at all?  If you need 
me to help with reservations or anything, please let me know as I would be 
happy to help.

Also note that Greg Whalley would like to meet with him.  Eddie does not want 
to come in any earlier than 4.  That can be a problem.  Maybe another thought 
is to have him come in twice, but I am afraid if we pick that option, it may 
be tough to get him back.

Anyway, look over this message, tell me your thoughts and after I hear back 
from you, I will arrange the interview schedule for Eddie on the 23rd.

1135,"Gerald, one thing that Chris asked for was an expansion of the area in which 
Lost Creek would agree not to compete for gathering.  They asked to include 
Long Butte in the area in addition to Madden.  Both Mark and I have rejected 
this idea as I have already had discussions with the operator of Long Butte 
about gathering their gas on Lost Creek.  That really wasn't the deal to 
begin with anyway.  Also, have you drafted the ENA IT gathering agreement 
with Lost Creek?  We really need to execute that thing in the next two weeks!

I just got off the phone with Chris at BR.  He has reviewed the agreements 
with Lee and Lee had a couple of points.  One is if the Administrative 
Manager goes to a cash-out method of balancing the system for some reason, 
and Lost Creek owes under the balancing provision, where do the funds come 
from?  I know that it would come from the sale of the excess gas that has 
been delivered to Lost Creek but I guess it is now clear how the gas is sold 
and how those funds are handled.  The same would apply to funds received from 
a shipper who is under balanced.  Again, Lost Creek would use the funds to 
purchase gas to restore line pack but what about the excess funds?  How does 
Lost Creek purchase the gas?  Actually good questions.  Also, Lee had some 
clean up language he wanted to propose on the fuel disposition issue.  Would 
you call Chris to get that and discuss it directly with him?  If you want me 
on the call, just let me know.

Just a couple of things.  First the risk type on the spreadsheets needs to be 
the same as on the files I sent to you.  Second, I am attaching a copy of the 
positions that I queried out of GRMS after I loaded your text files.  The 
positions aren't even close to the IM Positions file you save out to our

Our goal with the text files is to eliminate the need for plugging your

calculation.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you resolve 
this variance.

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order. 

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each set of ""zeros"" for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

1267,"Panel OKs Subpoenas for Energy Companies 
Electricity: Special state Senate committee will demand pricing information 
in inquiry into whether California has been gouged. 
By CARL INGRAM, MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers


SACRAMENTO--The Senate Rules Committee agreed Monday to issue subpoenas to 
eight out-of-state power generating companies demanding documents on pricing, 
bidding and other aspects of electricity sales in the state. 
Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of the special Senate committee that is 
investigating whether power wholesalers are illegally profiteering from 
California's energy crisis, said he expects the companies to resist. That 
would set the stage for a court fight, he said. 
In addition to subpoenas aimed at the private generating companies, the 
committee also put the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power on notice 
that unless it voluntarily provides information on its power sales to the 
state, the data will be subpoenaed as well. And the panel threatened to 
subpoena records of the state Department of Water Resources unless it turns 
over information on how it has spent more than $7 billion to keep electricity 
flowing in California. 
Under Senate regulations, Dunn's panel needed approval of the Rules Committee 
to issue the subpoenas. 
Industry executives deny that they have broken any laws in selling 
electricity at premium prices to California's financially strapped utilities 
and the state water department. 
The subpoenas will be issued to Reliant Energy, which Gov. Gray Davis has 
publicly accused of price gouging, Dynegy Energy Services Inc., Williams 
Energy, Enron Corp., NRG Energy Inc., Duke Energy, Mirant Inc., and AES Corp. 
Dunn said executives of the generators seemed cooperative when the 
investigation was launched two months ago. Since then, he said, they have 
raised barriers, including demands that the confidentiality of their 
documents be protected. 
The demand for information from the Los Angeles DWP and the state's water 
resources department were pushed by Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine), vice 
chairman of the rules panel. 
""Why are we not attempting to subpoena the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power? There certainly have been suggestions that they have profited,"" 
Johnson said, referring to reports from the California Independent System 
Operator about large profits that DWP made by selling power to the rest of 
the state. 
Reflecting the views of many lawmakers, Johnson said the Legislature also 
needs information on power purchases that the state water department makes 
from wholesalers and the bidding strategies used to make the bids. 
Davis has refused to make details of the purchases public. He contends that 
if generators knew how much the state was spending on power, they might raise 
their prices. Several news organizations and a legislator are suing to make 
the information public. 
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), chairman of the Rules 
Committee, opposed issuing subpoenas to the city and state departments, at 
least temporarily, leading to the agreement for a one-week delay before 
subpoenas would be issued to the agencies. 
The big energy companies also took a hit Monday from a leading advocacy group 
for the poor. 
The Pacific Institute for Community Organization, a coalition of faith-based 
groups that has pressed for California to cover more of the millions of 
working citizens without any health insurance, voiced concern that the energy 
crisis is hitting the poor hardest. 
The group, which scheduled a Capitol rally today, plans to urge political 
leaders to use the economic power of the state's huge pension funds to 
leverage the companies. 
The two pension funds own at least $1.2 billion in stocks and bonds in most 
of the major firms involved in the state energy crisis, from Enron of Texas 
to Duke of North Carolina, the advocates said. 
""They could bring the voice of stockholders into the debate, as a major 
stockholder, and take a more enlightened view of what is happening to 
California,"" said activist Jim Keddy. ""We really have no voice inside those 
companies right now."" ",CARL INGRAM MIGUEL BUSTILLO Joe Dunn Gray Davis Ross Johnson Johnson Pro Tem John Burton Jim Keddy,more than $7 billion at least $1.2 billion,"Senate Times Staff Writers The Senate Rules Committee the

The kind of taxes would be ad valorem taxes.  We have a whole tax department that deals with that stuff.  Besides the Enron defendants named in this suit, see if any Enron entity ever paid these taxes for Zapata County.

	Please keep me closely advised of your progress.

1284,"Drew -- here is Lorraine's update on the Val Verde situation that I mentioned 
in my previous e-mail.   Recall that we've been unable to accept quantities 
of gas from Burlington because of the high temperatures at the interconnect 
in recent years.  I've recommended that we seek amendment of the contract as 
soon as possible to reflect what we CAN do.  

The proposed amendment Lorraine is referring to, which Burlington rejected, 
modified our obligation to provide firm compression sufficient to accept 
250,000 MMBtu.  

//
Burlington Resources - Val Verde Plant - Michelle and I had a follow-up 
conversation with BR Thursday.  I faxed the proposed amendment to BR Monday 
and we hadn't heard from them yet.  They claim approximately $135,000/month 
in lost revenues because we are holding their production down.  Michele and 
Darrell will work to pull together the data on exactly which days we have not 
been able to take BR's gas.  I mentioned to BR that we were putting this info 
together, but they claim since they were told to back off to 180,000 - 
190,000 MMBtu from about mid-June through July, our data would not accurately 
reflect BR's inability to schedule in excess of 180/190.  They will not 
accept our wording in the interconnect amendment, specifically ""best efforts"" 
and ""subject to operating conditions on TW"", so we will need to revise this 
further.

We offered alternate receipt point flexibility at Ignacio and alternate 
delivery point flexibility at El Paso Blanco on their Jackrabbit contract but 
they do not think this is sufficient to agree to amend the interconnect

1289,"Let me clarify two of the more substantive matters that were not included in 
the errata - Wheeler Ridge and the Pooling Revisions.? The first, Wheeler 
Ridge, was not included in the errata because of concerns expressed by IP and 
ORA about the impact these changes would have on Kern River shippers.? 
SoCalGas did not oppose the revision and would accept the language as 
proposed by PG&E, especially if it would gain their non-opposition.? There 
was also a concern expressed by some parties that the WR revisions went 
beyond the bounds of an errata and should be considered a revision of the 
settlement.?? As for the Pooling Revisions, Dynegy expressed reservations 
about the proposed changes that included substantial increases in the number 
of pools available per shipper.? Dynegy was not able to garner internal 
approval in time for us to prepare the errata for filing later today, so 
Pooling revisions were taken off the table.? SoCalGas supports the pooling 
revisions and no other party expressed any concerns.? ALJ Biren asked us to 
file a revised settlement document with the corrected pages included and to 
mail it out to the parties today, so our already compressed deadline for 
getting this out the door was even more compressed.? 

Since I was unable to get resolution from all of the parties of the 
outstanding differences, I could not include the revisions that were 
circulated (to our dismay).? PG&E has now indicated they will file limited 
opposition and they have now served a discovery request upon SoCalGas with 
regard to Wheeler Ridge.

It's February and that means it's time to start getting your tax returns 
prepared, making your IRA contributions for the last year and it's a great 
time to start planning for this year. The subject of this month's newsletter 
talks about how ShareBuilder (Netstock's online brokerage) can help you with 
all of those things.

SHAREBUILDER & H&R BLOCK PARTNER: JUST IN TIME FOR TAXES!
I am pleased to announce ShareBuilder has partnered with H&R Block to offer 
you access to their premiere Online Tax Program. Just go to 
http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partners/netstock/index.html to get started. We 
thought it would be timely to offer an online tax resource to all 
ShareBuilders with services ranging from tax advice to complete professional 
tax preparation.  H&R Block combines 46 years of tax experience, the 
knowledge of a nationwide network of tax professionals, and now the speed and 
convenience of the Internet. The comprehensive list of H&R Block services 
available include:

Ask a Tax Advisor - Quick, accurate answers from knowledgeable tax 
professionals.

Professional Tax Service - Professional tax preparation combined with the 
convenience of the Internet.

Online Tax Program - A do-it-yourself online tax preparation and filing 
program, and a downloadable version of Kiplinger Tax Cut software.

Professional Review - You prepare your return, then H&R Block professionals 
check for possible errors and provide tax-planning tips for next year.

Electronic Refund Advance - Allows you to receive a tax refund advance.


INVESTING ISN'T A SCIENCE... IT'S A DISCIPLINE
In January I talked a little about why it is important to think about 
diversification. Whether you are new to investing or have been for a while, 
you've probably witnessed the stock market's volatility over the past year. 
It's important to realize you have to manage your investment risk and there 
are some simple investing strategies that can help.

Once you have determined the amount you can invest each week or month, the 
next step is to create a diversified portfolio that meets your long-term 
goals. If you're only investing in one or two stocks each month, you're 
putting all the risk into the performance of those specific stocks. 
Increasing the number of securities in your portfolio can help you by 
spreading risk among a broader group of stocks. To set up a ShareBuilder 
Plan, just go to http://www.sharebuilder.com/sharebuilder/account/index.asp 
and select ""ShareBuilder Plan"".

INDEX SHARES... AN EASY WAY TO DIVERISIFY!
Another great way to add diversification is by adding Index Shares to your 
portfolio. Index Shares are securities that represent the composition of a 
broad-market, specific sector, or international index. With Index Shares you 
instantly get exposure to a portfolio of stocks.

Here are the Top-10 Index Shares available through ShareBuilder:
? QQQ - Nasdaq-100
? SPY - S&P 500
? DIA - Dow Industrials
? XLK - AMEX Technology Select
? XLE - AMEX Energy Select
? XLF - AMEX Financial Select
? IWB - iShares Russell 1000
? IWM - iShares Russell 2000
? IYH - iShares  US Healthcare Sector
? IYF - iShares US Financial Sector


THE SHAREBUILDER NO FEE IRA: A POPULAR CHOICE!
In December we introduced the ShareBuilder No Fee IRA, which allows you to 
setup automatic monthly funding for your retirement account. You can invest 
in a portfolio of stocks automatically through monthly contributions, just 
like you would a regular ShareBuilder Plan! This IRA lets you effortlessly 
get invested throughout the year to help fund your retirement.

Instead of writing a last-minute check for $2000 (and missing a whole year of 
investing), open a ShareBuilder IRA now. Not only do you still have a chance 
to contribute for 2000 taxes (before April 15th 2001), you can also set up an 
investment plan for 2001! Simply select the stocks you want to invest in, 
specify your monthly contribution, and the account will run automatically. 
You will be investing your funds throughout the year without your having to 
think about it. Just go to 
http://www.sharebuilder.com/sharebuilder/promotion/index.asp?promocode=iraedu

I need only ensure the funds we will need in order to meet the margin call at 
Morgan is ready.



David,

I expect the needed margin at Morgan to be under $30mm once we move our longs 
out.  Morgan has today agreed to 25% for shorts (from an average of 50%).  Of 
the $30mm needed half is already at Goldman and Bear.  

I anticipate therefore no more than $15mm in needed funds.  It may in fact be 
less I will true up tomorrow

Can we get this by next week, and allow Cheryl to proceed full steam?

1328,"Hello Team, 

Now that we have sent for execution or executed close to 50 new agreements and we have to refer back to these agreements and documents, it is all the more important that we make sure that the administrative tasks we previously  discussed are in fact accomplished.    I suggest that we schedule a meeting to make sure 

(1) that, as per our previous discussions, Stephanie or whichever legal assistant working on brokerage agreements are tracking the agreements sent out and creating the brokerage agreement files once the Agreements are executed.   Also, we want to make sure everyone knows where to go when you need certain documents/where these files are located and what is supposed to be in them.  (I think they were just moved from Samantha's desk to Stephanie's desk, right?)

(2) I recommend that once we get the executed documents, we need a legal assistant to record the account numbers and execution dates in lotus notes when she receives the documents.

(3) Also, I want to make sure that we are keeping a file on Authorized Trader announcements and changes.  I want to resuugest that the legal assistant also needs to send some type of form letter to the pre-existing firms to give notice when the list of authorized traders changes - this is critical, especially now that there are so many accounts and so many changes.  Maybe we can draft a form letter and have a template or something.  We should also create a list of contact persons to whom such a list has to go to.

(4) Also, now that we have more another legal assistant, we should meet to discuss how the assistant can ""take back"" some of the tasks I had taken on to make life easier without such help - getting signatures, preapring the documents, calling the counterparty etc.  This will free-up some much needed time to review ISDA's, Confirms etc.

(5) Which legal assistants will work on what?

Sara may have additional topics, this is just some of immediate concern.

Please read Mike Gildea's issue 2. I work with Mike closely on operating 
policy issues.  He is with Duke NA, the IPP side, formerly with EEI.  I need 
some help on where Enron stands on current legislation as it relates to his 
question.

Do we think the language empowers NERC with too much authority?  Or does it 
allow for any organization, i.e. GISB/EISB to perform the functions.

I know Enron agrees with NERC not imposing restrictions on the RTOs and slow 
down market formation - but we certainly don't want to have to deal with 
every RTO as a reliability standard setting organization.

1358,"PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

This is quick note to let you know that I shall work very closely with Lisa 
on Fireball project (see first project below).  While working in her group to 
provide the required regulatory due diligence, we shall also attempt to:  a) 
link the effort to RAC process (mainly through Dave Gorte), b) Find accurate 
measure to reflect the risk the Enron sees for GA reporting purposes (also 
measures for our contribution to the project).

Not only this project is important in terms of size ($750 million), but also 
in its activity (acquisition of coal company); it is an excellent opportunity 
to document the processes followed as they happen.    

I am grateful for Lisa's help and support.

Please let me know if you have any question.

1365,"Attached is an analysis of the probability of a devaluation in Argentina and 
the contractual protections TGS has in the event of a devaluation.  

Long and short of it is - 

Argentina's economy is primarily dollarized and it would appear that a 
devaluation would do considerable short term harm to the economy. 

Convertibility Law was enacted in 1991.  Large part of the population 
remembers the super inflation of 1989 and 1990.

To devalue the currency, Argentina would have to amend the Convertibility Law 
- this requires  approval of the Federal Congress.

TGS has numerous layers of protection from a devaluation - in addition to the 
Convertibility law, it has protection through its license and regulations.  
Indeed, as you remembered, the tariff is indexed to the exchange rate.

A concern is - to the extent the Government takes action as drastic as 
changing the Convertibility Law to implement a devaluation, and it is willing 
to suffer the short term economic and political harm of a devaluation - then 
there is a reasonable chance they would go the extra step and find a way 
delink the tariffs of the privatized regulated companies from the dollar.    
In this case Enron would have protection under the BIT treaty.

The impact on Enron's P&L is a function of whether or not we use the Peso as 
the functional currency.  If we use the Peso as the functional currency - 
Enron would have a signficant negative translation adjustment from a 
devaluation.  If we use the dollar as the functional currency - there would 
be no impact on our income statement.   I will research this further in order 
to ensure we can use the dollar as a our functional currency.

I would think you need to get Tim Belton and Wes Colwell comfortable with any proposal to settle with SCE.   ""Final"" invoices have been received for ISO settlements for the months of December and January.  However, I believe the ISO can continue to make changes to these months, if they chose to.  I do not have an issue with the below, however, these should be the easiest months to settle as there is little disagreement re this period  (FERC refund case is the only outstanding issue).  I would want to get some understanding of what they will support for the period beginning January 19, 2001.  

Please consider something like this for the pro-ration language:
The utility bills for the month of January should be  bifurcated into two periods, days on or before January 18th and the days after January 18th.   Prorating or allocating the bill cycle for January would be incorrect.  I believe SCE actually calculates a daily rate, and therefore it would be appropriate to only pro-rate volumes, but not rate.  

Call to discuss. 

Wanda

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Please review the language below; it is a first attempt at making a non 
binding proposal to Noble Drilling.  Please return your approved language 
asap.

Thanks
John A. Peyton



Dear Mark Mey,

We appreciate your interest in our new dayrate financial products.  

For your consideration, we would like to indicatively propose a transaction 
in which Enron North America would purchase a Financial Call Option (""Cap"") 
from Noble Drilling Corporation for the Calculation Period  April 1, 2001 
through June 30, 2001 for one Rig.  The Strike Price would be $65,000 per 
(Rig*Day) and the premium which we would pay to Noble Drilling Corporation 
(within Five Business Days of the Trade Date) would be US Dollars $200,000.

The Commodity Reference Price would be the arithmetic mean of the high and 
low Rig Day Rates for JU-300'-IC as published by Offshore Data Services, 
Inc., or its successor, in the last issue of Gulf of Mexico Weekly Rig 
Locator, or any successor publication, published during the applicable 
Calculation Period, on the page entitled ""Gulf of Mexico Rig Utilization and 
Day Rates"".  The Payment Date(s) would be the fifth (5th) Business Day 
following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.

We have authority to enter into the above transaction and would be able to 
move quickly toward providing you with an executable contract.  Because the 
market for dayrates is highly volatile and because we may have made similar 
proposals to other counterparties, this indicative proposal is only good 
until August 31st, 2000.  We look forward to further discussions. 

This document contains indicative terms only and is not intended to create a 
binding or enforceable contract nor is it an offer or commitment to enter 
into any transaction.  All terms are subject to change until agreement as to 
a specific transaction has been reached.  ENA is not acting as a fiduciary or 
advisor and you should evaluate and understand the terms, conditions, and 
risks of all transactions in making your decisions with respect thereto.  The 
proposal described herein is subject to further review and approval by ENA 
and Counterparty and, among other matters, further review and approval of the 
board of directors of each party, and the negotiations, execution and 
delivery of definitive agreements containing all appropriate provisions, 
including those related to credit, limitations of damages and others.

1402,"Employee Trading

Having discussed this with Donna Lowry and Mark Taylor, there follows a very 
general clarification, highlighting the two main principles which apply to 
Enron employees' personal trading in securities and commodities.

In general, provided an employee does not have non-public price sensitive 
information or confidential information obtained in the course of his 
employment in relation to the issuer of securities, then the employee is 
entitled to trade freely in the securities of that issuer.  This is, of 
course, subject to compliance with the tems of the Restrictive Lists 
circulated periodically by Houston, to the SFA Personal Account Notice 
requirements (where relevant) and any other procedural requirements 
established by the Enron Business Unit in which the employee works.
In general, it would be regarded as serious misconduct for an individual to 
trade for his or her own account in any commodity (eg. gas, power etc.) 
traded by any Enron Business Unit, whether or not the employee works in that 
unit.  

Questions regarding principle 1 above should generally be directed to 
Compliance (or you should seek your own private legal advice); questions 
regarding point 2 above should generally be directed to Ted Murphy.

You should now sign up to the above Policy and comply with its terms, as 
expanded in this note.  Thanks.

Best regards.

Gentlemen,

We wanted to make you aware of some discussions that are going on concerning 
the possibility of ETS clearing trades in lumber futures on behalf of Enron 
Industrial Markets.  Presently, ETS is not a member of the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange, and has an omnibus account with ABN Amro through which our orders 
are placed.

Presently, EIM places its orders through one or more brokers who give up the 
trades at the end of the day to one or two institutions who will clear those 
trades for EIM.  The chief benefit which is sought out in EIM clearing lumber 
futures through ETS is the consolidation of their trade clearance business 
through ETS, and the elimination of the use of third parties that presently 
clear those trades.

As an operational matter, ETS is equipped to handle the business, as it 
already has the infrastructure to do so. 

The discussions are in a fairly preliminary stage, and have been principally 
among the business people.  We would welcome your input on this matter.

1418,"Dear Mark and Mark!
I spoke to Jeanette Elbertson last week and she suggested that I send you 
both a brief outline giving some background which I have pleasure in doing.
My Chairman John Wisbey who founded the company in 1989 is next in New York 
in October 11/12/13 but I am unsure as to where we would possibly meet if you 
deemed it worthwhile?
As his Vice Chairman I am working out of our New York office for 6 months 
generally in an effort to raise our group profile and as active associate 
members of ISDA Rick Grove and his team have suggested that I meet as many of 
the Board members as possible during my time.
Since John founded the company we have established a reputation of excellence 
in financial systems,consultancy and training.Today we do business with about 
45 of the world's top 100 banks.We are based in London with offices in New 
York and Hong Kong.
Our 5 businesses could be summarised as follows:

1)Risk Management:
Firmament is an intellectual capital model for the risk process in a 
financial institution.The areas covered comprise credit,market,liquidity and 
operational risk management.
FirmRisk is a suite of risk management component software all web based used 
to evaluate market risk,credit risk and VaR as well as providing 
netting,collateral and P&L analysis.
2) Trading Systems:
Oberon is an integrated multi-currency trading system for the management of 
interest rate and FX portfolios.
3) Document Management:
Image-Gen Planet provides access to data and documents via the Internet and 
was especailly designed for UK local authorities to manage access to planning 
databases.It is believed to be the first UK-built application offering access 
to a Sybase database through the Internet.
4) Valuation Services:
a ) ValuRisk:This is a monthly/daily service providing closing mark-to-market 
prices in the interest rate derivative markets.
b) ValuSpread:This is a confidential price validation service for market 
makers in credit derivative products.
5) Lombard Risk Consultants:
Provides bespoke training to senior level executives in all aspects of risk 
management including Basel.collateral,credit methodologies and policies.Also 
provides courses on all aspects of the derivatives and associated 
markets.Course are also public and web-based.

I will telephone Jeanette next week to see how we might meet in order to take 
matters further.The area we would ideally like to focus on is Risk Management.

Netting and Collateral Agreements, being:

1. Canadian Natural Resources;
2. our form based upon the form entered into with Canadian Natural Resources; 
and
3. the form recently prepared by Mary Cook in Houston with respect to PG&E 
exposures.

In my experience, these agreements are difficult to put in place for various 
reasons, including:

1. the asymmetry of various issues between the existing governing physical 
and financial master agreements;
2. multiple counterparties, both on the Enron side and on the counterparty 
side, with multiple obligations affecting different physical and financial 
commodity positions; and
3. drafting (i.e., when you get into drafting one of these agreements, since 
both the physical and financial master agreements tend to be ""tightly"" 
drafted and rely heavily on ""defined terms"", marrying concepts relating to 
calculation of exposures, termination amounts, performance assurance, and the 
like, can be very difficult).

In short, these agreements are not easy to put in place, but I do believe 
that in the appropriate circumstances they are worthwhile.

I would think your best starting point may be the precedent form of Master 
Netting and Collateral Agreement that I have referred to as item #2 above.  I 
spent some considerable time on that document and believe it would be the 
best starting point.

Thank you for the below email.  It is good to clear up the confusion
regarding this process.  At the end of the email you ask for our comments on
the ROETA execution process.

We would prefer that the ROETA be executed off-line.  It is on that basis
that we have sought the opinion of overseas counsel.  That said, you may
form the view that online execution of the ROETA is no different to the
operation of a website with a hotlinked disclaimer.  On that basis you may
decide to execute the ROETA online.  We have some concerns regarding
security issues because of the distribution of a password without a
supporting agreement, however, you may form the view that this is a minor
risk.

If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate contact me.

Regards

Regarding the legal comments below:

My impression was that the Joe had settled the choice of law issue:  i.e. the 
umbrella documents (Password Application and Electronic Trading Agreement) 
will be identical to those used in North America containing a New York choice 
of law provision.  These agreements have been approved by local counsel in 
Japan.  This is till my recommendation unless the commercial team decides 
that a document governed by Japanese law is essential.  As is the case for 
all EnronOnline trading, the online GTC's governing various commodities 
contain an appropriate choice of law for that product (e.g. English law for 
UK gas, New York law for US derivatives, etc.) regardless of where the 
counterparty is situated.  When a Japanese product is offered, I would assume 
that you will create a GTC governed by Japanese law, but last I heard that 
bridge is still ahead of us.

I don't know what the ""international contracts"" are that Rousseau refers to.  
There is no standard agreement for online trading.  The ETA provides that if 
a counterparty and the relevant Enron entity have a master agreement in place 
(such as an ISDA Master Agreement for derivatives trading [is this what 
Rousseau had in mind?]) such master will control the relevant transactions.  
The choice of law in that master would be the subject of negotiation at the 
time the master was signed.

In summary, unless the commercial team has changed its mind on the documents, 
the legal side of things is ready to go.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

In spite of the news in the media about Enron, I see
opportunity. Since we've communicated last I've been real
busy selling my services to major energy traders. Actually
Enron is one of the traders that have my company listed as
one of three or four minority businesses that will be
involved with supplying the power for contracts. These
contracts start at $100,000,000 and go up.

Barry, I'm going to forge ahead, but I'd still rather have
the opportunity to work and learn from the biggest and
best.
One of my strong points is to get the deal done, another is
to understand my limitations. If you give me the shot on
the origination side you'd be most pleased. If I can
convince the world's largest energy trader to put me on
their contracts and RFPs after being in business for less
than a year, just think what could be done with a
supportive back office and timely information.

What I'm seeking is a chance to excel with all the tools at
my disposal. Drop me a email and tell me your thoughts.

Further to our discussion this morning, I have attached a draft of a term sheet regarding the development of generation at REU's Clear Creek site with the intent of marketing the output to DWR under a 3-6 year tolling agreement.
 

We think this summer will afford us a great opportunity to negotiate with DWR to obtain significant value substantially offsetting the installed cost of the unit.  To that end, we want to position ourselves so that we can move quickly should DWR make a strong bid for capacity and energy.  Notwithstanding, we appreciate Redding's obligations regarding its load and think that there will be a lot of flexibility with DWR in structuring a transaction that meets everyone's needs.

If you are interested, we propose entering into an MOU that summarizes the general terms of the transaction and roles and responsibilities.  Let's talk after you have reviewed the attached term sheet.
