After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the risk/reward 
play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and generator buying 
would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in price in H, the 
strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.  
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2 
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be 
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching, full 
liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric generation 
demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around 1.5 bcf/d 
greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2 bcf/d out 
of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start really losing 
demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about recession in 
industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think 
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward 
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage 
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

John and Sireesha have just pushed to staging a bunch of enhancements / bug

 1.  Configurable Questionnaire
 2.  Invitee Lists Part I (this does NOT include the upload of the contact 
lists)
 3.  User Statistics
 4.  Fix for the Issuing Entity
 5.  Auction security fix

 7.  Rewrite of the view deal page impacting permission levels in EVERY domain
 8.  The Adapter for the User Registration piece (this should be seamless to 
the user, but be happy that     this change ELIMINATES message brokers from 
this process)
 9.  Various bug fixes including those relating to view closing etc.

The remaining auction enhancements are planned to be pushed sometime early 
next week.

I would recommend everybody spend some time testing next week and reflect 
their comments / suggestions to John and I.  

The location of the test site is:  http://testfinweb1.ecomtest.enron.com.  
You also need to establish new IDs and passwords (since your production IDs 
and Passwords will not work!).  The admin ID and password (if you need to 
approve users and deals to test them are - ID: jspitz; Pwd: pass).

We do PLAN on pushing all this stuff to PRODUCTION (barring any major bugs or

34,"  The ISO will be hosting a Participating Load Stakeholder
meeting on September 20, 2000 at the ISO.  The meeting is a broad
stakeholder meeting to help refine our load participation programs for 2001.
Much of the day will be committed to presentations and discussions on
lessons learned from 2000 and proposals for 2001, including technical
standards, contractual issues, and load management.

  Some vendors have approached the ISO with systems that would
aggregate loads, give them an opportunity to curtail based on day ahead
energy prices, and provide the curtailment instructions and verifications.
This type of program may be ultimately sold to ESPs or IOUs. In order to
accelerate the testing of such systems the ISO may sponsor a pilot program
to test the system/approach with selected vendors.  The pilot program will
test the concepts, the interfaces, and assist in bringing together vendors,
ESPs, SCs, and the IOUs as we move forward toward improving demand
responsiveness in our markets.  We have reserved about 1 -2 hours in the
afternoon, to allow 3-4 vendors to present their approaches to the
stakeholder group.

  In addition, we welcome you to visit a vendor fair that the
ISO is hosting on September 21, 2000.  The ISO has  experienced
considerable interest from the market place in such a vendor fair that would
include entities providing Data Processing Gateway technology for both
Generators and Loads in the Participating Ancillary Services Load Program.
This effort is being encouraged to develop multiple solutions pertaining to
installations of direct telemetry for Generators and Load providing
Ancillary Services to the ISO markets.

  The agendas are attached for both events, including
directions and lodging information.

43,"We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20

49,"SIPPING VODKA
A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly
speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous
on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water
glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning
of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He
proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he
found the following note on the door:

1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not
referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.
8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he
said,""Take this and eat it for it is my body.""  He did not
say, Eat me""
12.  The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,""
13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub
thanks for the grub, yeah God.
14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at
St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.

          A MESSAGE FROM GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                                     Sunday, November 5, 2000


  Dear Friend:

  Tuesday is Election Day and I'm asking for your vote.

  Americans are ready for a fresh start. They want a leader
  who trusts them -- not government -- to make decisions for
  their communities.  They want bold leadership that will
  reach across party lines to get things done.

  I am that leader.  I will work to change the tone in
  Washington, D.C. to use these good times for great
  purposes such as reforming public education so every
  child learns to read and creating an environment where
  entrepreneurs and families can flourish and realize their
  dreams.

  I am also committed to providing immediate prescription
  drug coverage for seniors and strengthening our Social
  Security to preserve its benefits for the greatest
  generation and their children and grandchildren.

  This is a close race. Every vote matters. I'm asking for
  your vote and your help.  I urge you to click on this
  link (http://www.georgewbush.com/you.html) for the tools
  that will help you get one undecided voter to vote.
  Please take your family, friends and neighbors to the
  polls to vote for me on Tuesday, November 7th.


  Sincerely,


  George W. Bush
  Governor
  State of Texas


  P.S. If you receive a phone call attacking me or my
  proposals please record it or make note of the attack
  and report it by calling 1-800-878-9374.

Hi Folks,

?

Matchups to Avoid  and Exploit.?=20

Passing Game  Matchups.?? Here's how I see the matchups this  week.? Please=
=20
note, see the  cheatsheet online?http://www.cheatsheets.net/week15sheet.htm=
? =20
for exactly where I rank playersand to  determine who to start.? Just becau=
se=20
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily=
=20
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup.? The matchup info  is mea=
nt=20
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between =20
players.??=20

Note:? I=01,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last f=
our=20
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mik=
e=20
Hall=01,s excellent FLM League Management Software.? http://www.fflm.com/fo=
r=20
more info.? =20

Here we go:

Locks:? These games heavily favor the Offense =20

Seattle Passing  Game vs Bronco Defense??  If we=01,ve seen one  trend rece=
ntly=20
in defenses it=01,s to start your QB / WR / TEs against the Broncos  and wo=
rry=20
about your RBs.? They=01,re  tough on the running game but easy against the=
=20
pass.? I won=01,t get into whether that=01,s a  =01&chicken or the egg=018 =
situation but=20
the bottom line is go with your passing guys  against Denver.? They rank # =
31=20
in  passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? QB Jon Kitna =
=20
gets another start  and while I have a hard time putting too much faith in=
=20
him, he=01,s been ok.? Derrick  Mayesand  Sean  Dawkinsshould see lots  of=
=20
action and rookie Darrell  Jacksonis working his  way back into the mix.? I=
f=20
you=01,ve  been sitting on RB Shaun  Alexander, coach Mike  Holmgren did sa=
y he=20
wanted to see more of Alexander in passing downs but I=01,m  still not too=
=20
excited about him yet.

Tennessee Passing  Game vs Bengal Defense?? Once again, keep an eye on  QB=
=20
Steve  McNair=01,shealth this  week.? It=01,s early, but he=01,s already  b=
eing called=20
a game time decision as he tries to recover from knee and ankle  injuries.?=
=20
Keep your fingers crossed  as it=01,s a tasty matchup vs the weak Bengal pa=
ss=20
defense.? They rank # 30 in passing yards allowed  per game over the last=
=20
month and are just playing out the season.? Cornerback Rodney Heath is lost=
=20
for the  year with a bad shoulder and that should make things even easier.?=
=20
Derrick  Masonis the clear cut  # 1 WR with Chris  Sanders# 2.? The best=20
receiver on the team (or at  least most utilized) is TE Frank  Wycheckwho=
=01,s=20
starting to  get back to his normal high level of  production.

Denver Passing  Game vs Seahawk Defense??? By now you know the  drill:? Sta=
rt=20
any player vs  Seattle.? Just do it.? The Seahawks are anemic.? QB Brian=20
Griese did start to throw some  but he=01,s still at least a couple weeks a=
way,=20
maybe more.? Gus  Frerottegets another  start and if you=01,re looking for =
him=20
to regain that 400+ yard form he showed  early on, this is his best chance =

ne=20
 Carswelland  Desmond  Clarkare excellent  plays at TE.? I=01,d start eithe=
r=20
one  and feel pretty good about it, especially  Carswell.

Baltimore Passing  Game vs Charger Defense?? San Diego made a run back at =
=20
respectability on defense but I=01,m thinking they=01,ve fallen back down t=
o well =20
below average.? Over the last four  weeks, they rank # 27 in passing yards=

allowed per game.? For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy  Points allowed =
to=20
the opposing QB.?  The Ravens come back after a bye week off and should be=
=20
ready to  roll.? QB Trent  Dilferis playing  exceptionally well and WRs=20
Qadry  Ismailand  Patrick  Johnsoncould do  well.? The most enticing matchu=
p=20
may  be Shannon  Sharpeas San Diego  ranks just 24th in Fantasy Points=20
allowed to the opposing TE for the  year.

St. Louis Passing  Game vs Viking Defense?? I don=01,t think you keep  QB K=
urt =20
Warnerdown for  long.? Sure, he had an awful game  last week but some of th=
at=20
can be blamed on the WRs who I bet you don=01,t see drop  half of what Warn=
er=20
throws this time.?  The Vikings still give up lots of passing yards ranking=
 #=20
26 in passing  yards allowed per game over the last month.? For the year,=
=20
they rank # 24 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing QB.?  Isaac Bruce=
=20
is the best WR  while Torry Holthas been  surprisingly disappointing lately=
.?=20
 He=01,s still worth a start though.?  Az-Zahir  Hakimalways has a  chance =
too.?=20
The Vikings just don=01,t  have the secondary to keep up with these  guys.

?

Prime Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense?

Buffalo  Passing Game vs Colt Defense?? I probably get more mail from my =
=20
ripping Rob Johnson than I do for any other player.? I make no apologies as=
 I=20
really just  don=01,t like the guy.? He simply has  major troubles finishin=
g a=20
game.?  Although he draws a great matchup this week against Indy, one of th=
e =20
weaker defenses in the league.?  Safety Chad Cota has a concussion and is=
=20
questionable so they might be  even less effective.? On the other  hand, th=
e=20
Colts definitely seem to up the intensity at home.? As you can see from my=
=20
rankings, I=01,m not  thinking too much of Johnson again this week, but he =
does=20
have a good  matchup.? Eric Moulds is the  primary WR as always with Peerle=
ss=20
Price and Jeremy McDonald  picking up the scraps.? TE Jay  Reimersma is a=
=20
favorite target and gets plenty of looks.?

Pittsburgh  Passing Game vs Giants Defense?? The Kordell Stewart  Bandwagon=

inspired the team.?? The pass defense still ranks # 25  in passing yards=20
allowed  per game over the last month though.? For the year, they rank # 23=
 =20
in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing QB.? Hines Ward is the WR of=20
choice on  this team and I=01,d feel fine starting him. He=01,s not even th=
e true #=20
2 guy, but  you could do worse then taking a reach on Bobby Shaw.? For some=
=20
reason, I like him over starter  Courtney Hawkins. Even TE Mark Bruener is =
a=20
solid choice as he=01,s  done more in the last two weeks than he=01,s done =
in two=20
years.???

Kansas City  Passing Game vs Panthers Defense? I=01,m  dreading the Gunther=

Cunningham firing as he may make Dick Vermiel look like  Iron Mike.? A soli=

game here could  help him keep his job (which may have Chief fans pulling f=

starter too.? Sylvester  Morris continues to regress which is troubling.?=

Carolina ranks just # 24 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last=
=20
four games although for the year, they=01,ve  fared better ranking # 9 in=
=20
Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing QB.? Part  of that is they seem to=
=20
give up a lot of yards without yielding the TD so be  leery in TD only=20
leagues.?

Carolina  Passing Game vs Chief Defense?? If you=01,ve been fence sitting w=
ith =20
Steve Beuerlein, this may be a week to take a close look at him.? The Chief=

rank # 21 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks and=

they may be missing CB James  Hasty who=01,s questionable with a knee.?  WR=
=20
Muhsin Muhammad is playing like a man possessed lately and he=01,s  a sure=
=20
starter.? Donald Hayes  got through last week=01,s game without reinjuring =
his=20
groin and he=01,s a solid  option as well.? TE Kris  Mangum is no Wesley Wa=
lls=20
but he=01,s a pretty good player.? The Chiefs do get back home where  they=
=01,re=20
tougher but I like this matchup.?

San  Francisco Passing Game vs Saints Defense??  The 49er pass defense is=
=20
better than people think and the Saints defense  is worse than many assume.=
?=20

=20
Garcia picked up right where  he left off last week against a tough San Die=
go=20
defense.? It was great news for Terrell  Owens fans as he looks on his way=
=20
back.? In the meantime, Jerry Rice  showed he still has a few tricks in the=
=20
bag.? I wouldn=01,t be surprised to see Tai  Streets and J.J. Stokes see=20
increased time at Rice=01,s expense though  as many feel the Hall of Famer =
isn=01,t=20
in the 49er=01,s plans for 2001.? RB Charlie Garner is always a threat  cat=
ching=20
the ball.? TE Greg  Clark is suddenly a producer so he=01,s worth a shot to=
o.=20
This could be a  shootout.?

Jacksonville  Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense??  Two teams heading for the=
=20
couch in the post season but that=01,s about all  they have in common.?=20
Jacksonville  just ran out of time as they=01,re playing well now.? Arizona=

for the Jaguar passing game is talking coach Tom Coughlin into calling =20

gain  each time=01(?

Minnesota  Passing Game vs Ram Defense?? You don=01,t need any analysis fro=

Willie  Jackson is a solid # 2 WR and TE Andrew Glover has come alive =20
lately.? =20

??

Even Matchups:? These games  feature no real advantage either way?

Detroit  Passing Game vs Packer Defense?? Of course, all this hinges on the=

ribs of one Charlie Batch.?  If he can=01,t go, all bets are off.?  In fact=
,=20
even if he can go, you should hedge your bets a bit as we=01,ve  already se=

yards allowed per  game.? Johnnie  Morton is likely the top choice at WR wi=

return this week as he=01,s been practicing this week.? I wouldn=01,t start=
 him yet=20
but keep an eye  out as might pay dividends for astute owners who scoop him=
=20
up.? I can see plenty of James Stewart in  this one though as the weather=

could be really nasty for this  one.?

Chicago  Passing Game vs Patriot Defense?? This one=01,s full of story line=

56,"Hi Folks,
?
I'll?have the full blown matchups very late  tonight / Friday morning but for 
you last minute waiver wire watchers, here's  something you might be 
interested in:? Chris Warren might be worth a shot  as the Eagles have signed 
him as anticipated according to the AP.? Full  article is below.? I'm betting 
he's still got something left in the  tank.? I'm also betting coach Andy Reid 
is smart enough to figure a way for  him to contribute in some fashion. 
McNabb is not a QB that must be overly  protected so the fact Warren may not 
know all the pass protection blocks isn't  quite as critical as it normally 
is.? He could be worth a  shot.
?
See you Friday morning,
?
Joe

From the article: http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/eagles/thurs.htm?  The 
Philadelphia  Eagles have said for weeks that they're not looking ahead to 
the NFL playoffs.  But by adding recently waived running back Chris Warren on 
Thursday, the Eagles  may be thinking about what they need to succeed if they 
reach the postseason.  The Eagles claimed Warren one day after he was waived 
by the Dallas Cowboys.  

Warren, in his 11th NFL season,  will join the Eagles for Friday's practice 
and will be available Sunday against  the Cleveland Browns. 

''He's been in the league 11 years and at one  point he was one of the best 
backs in the game,'' Eagles head coach Andy Reid  said. ''Is he that now? I 
don't know. But he's a big back who has played well  this season.'' 

In Dallas this season, Warren rushed for 254 yards and  two touchdowns and 
averaged 4.3 yards per carry He also caught 31 passes for 302  yards and a 
touchdown. 

But in last Sunday's loss to Tampa Bay, Warren  misplayed a pass that 
deflected off his hands and was intercepted and returned  for a touchdown. He 
was benched after that play, and then was involved in a  shouting match with 
a Dallas coach on the sideline. 

Three days later, he  was waived. Dallas owner Jerry Jones said Warren 
''wasn't in the plans moving  forward,'' but Warren said he was cut because 
he wouldn't accept a one-year  contract extension for 2001 at his current 
salary, $715,000. 

Now Warren  is an Eagle. Philadelphia is looking to add a spark to a running 
game that has  been struggling since the season-ending injury to running back 
Duce Staley in  October. 

The running-back-by-committee group of Darnell Autry, Stanley  Pritchett and 
Brian Mitchell has averaged less than 3 yards per carry in the  last four 
games. Philadelphia, 9-5 and needing just one win in games against  Cleveland 
and Cincinnati to make the playoffs for the first time since 1996, has  
relied on quarterback Donovan McNabb almost exclusively to make the offense 
go.  

McNabb is averaging nearly 75% of the team's total offensive output.  

Warren began his NFL career in Seattle and ran for more than 1,000 yards  in 
four consecutive seasons, 1992-95. He made three Pro Bowls during that time.  

Seattle's career leading ground gainer, Warren has 7,654 yards rushing  in 
his career, which began in 1990. 

Warren signed with Dallas as an  unrestricted free agent prior to the 1998 
season. He has been a backup behind  Emmitt Smith the last three seasons. 

To make room on the active roster,  the Eagles waived wide receiver Alex Van 
Dyke.

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 The Hawks activated Mutombo from the injured list today, and he will play 
his first game of the season tomorrow night in Phoenix. He is now cured from 
a mild case of malaria and should help boost an Atlanta team that started 
0-5.  

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Barros, who has missed all four of Detroit's games this season because of a 
back injury, is reprortedly making good progress and could be back sooner 
than expected.  He has started running and is participating in shooting 
drills and scrimmages.     

 Lucious Harris , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Harris is scheduled to dress for tonight's game in Washington, but is 
unlikley to see any action.  He is not  expected to be available to the team 
until Saturday.  

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Sura, sidelined with a strained lower back, is expected to return to the 
active roster after the Warriors conclude a four-game road trip on November 
19.  He did some light running with his team during practice Monday and hopes 
to begin practicing next week.     

 Vonteego Cummings , G GS - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 
 Cummings will be out indefinitely after suffering  a fractured cheekbone.  
He is scheduled to have plastic surgery performed on the cheekbone this 
week.  Vinny Del Negro will play more minutes as the backup point guard in 
his absence.    

 Ricky Davis , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Davis dribbled and shot on the side on Tuesday, but insists he won't be able 
to return to the team until December.  Head Coach Pat Riley said a decision 
could be made today as to whether or not Davis will need surgery to repair 
his injured foot.    

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/08/00 
 Sprewell is reportedly suffering from back spasm which may keep him out of 
tonight's game against the Cavaliers.  Sprewell is currently tied for second 
on the team in scoring, averaging 13.0 points per game.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 
 Ceballos was benched in Saturday's loss to the Bucks, and Head Coach George 
Irvine wouldn't say whether he would be back in the lineup tonight against 
the Sixers.  Irvine is reportedly fed up with Ceballos' lack of conditioning 
and defensive intensity.     

 Randy Brown , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Brown will start at the point for Boston until Kenny Anderson returns from a 
fractured jaw. In his first start, Brown finished with four assists, two 
rebounds and no points in a 30-point loss to the Raptors.    

 Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Hammonds is now eligible to be removed from the injury list.  Head coach 
Flip Saunders hasn't made a decision yet but said that among the players on 
the list Hammonds, who is suffering from sore ankles, is the only one healthy 
enough to play.    

 Tracy Murray , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Murray, last season's eighth-best three-point shooter has played sparingly 
for the Nuggets so far.  He played eight minutes in Monday's game against 
Dallas and got limited action in the season opener against Seattle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Buckner's injured right foot is getting better but it is still not known yet 
when he will be able to return.  He said he won't be out for no longer than a 
week but head coach Don Nelson stated that it could be two weeks.  Buckner is 
suffering from a sprained ligament in his right foot.  Hubert Davis and 
rookie Courtney Alexander have gotten extended playing time in his absence.   
 

 William Avery , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 With Chauncey Billups in town, Avery has gotten very little playing time for 
the Timberwolves so far this season.  He has appeared in two of the T'Wolves 
four games this season playing only two minutes.  Billups is starting at 
shooting guard and is being used the backup point guard as well.    

 Damon Jones , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Reserve guard Damon Jones left Monday's game in the first half with a 
concussion.  He is questionable for Wednesday's game against Dallas.    

 Tony Massenburg , F VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Massenburg confirmed reports on Monday that he has asked for a trade. The 
nine-year veteran signed a three-year free-agent contract with Vancouver in 
the off-season. Grizzlies general manager Billy Knight said he is not 
contemplating a deal for Massenburg.  Massenburg is a bruising rebounder but 
will have very little Fantasy value wherever he plays.  

 Gary Payton , G SEA - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 Payton has been the ultimate Ironman in his career with the Sonics.  His 
game against Orlando marked the 319th consecutive start for him, dating back 
to March 18, 1996, the longest active streak in the NBA.  The last game he 
missed was March 15, 1996, against Dallas when he served a one-game 
suspension that snapped his career-high consecutive games played streak at 
354.  

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/08/00 
 McDyess played in Monday's game against Denver despite suffering from back 
spasms.  He played 31 minutes without aggravating his injury, scoring 12 
points and grabbing 11 rebounds.     

 Howard Eisley , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 He is backing up Steve Nash at point guard but head coach Don Nelson is 
using Eisley to finish games for Dallas.  Fifty-five percent of Eisley's 
total points and 41 percent of his assists this season have come in the final 
12 minutes of the game.  He scored 10 of his 14 points in Monday's game 
against Denver in the fourth quarter.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Williams missed Tuesday's game against the Lakers because of a sprained left 
knee.  He injured the knee when he landed awkwardly on it Sunday against 
Phoenix.   Williams will be evaluated on a day to day basis.  For now he is 
questionable for Thursday's game against Vancouver.  Matt Bullard started at 
small forward in his absence.     

 Juwan Howard , F WAS - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 Howard took a hard shot to his left eye during Tuesday night's game against 
the Bulls.  He left the floor dazed, but would later return to the game. He 
finished the contest with eight points and ten rebounds.   

 Brad Miller , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Miller broke his right hand on Tuesday night and could miss up to a month.  
He broke a bone in the base of his hand as he was grabbing a rebound against 
the Wizards. He had five points and eight rebounds in Chicago's 88-83 loss.   
 

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Sabonis could be back for part of the Blazers' Eastern Conference swing, 
which begins Monday in New Jersey.  He has missed all four of the Blazers' 
regular season games while he recovers from a knee injury.    

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/07/00 
 Geiger, who is recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, went 
through his first full practice yesterday at the Philadelphia College of 
Osteopathic Medicine.  He is eligible to come off the disabled list after 
tomorrow night's game, but the team hasn't disclosed any definite date as to 
when he will return.    

 Sherman Douglas , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Douglas twisted his left ankle slightly during practice on Monday, but is 
expected to be available tomorrow night when the Nets visit the Wizards. He 
is averaging 7.3 points, 1.0 assists and 1.3 rebounds through three games 
this season.      

 Tom Gugliotta , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Gugliotta went through his first practice on Monday since having major 
recontructive knee surgery eight months ago.  He damaged both his anterior 
cructiate and medial collateral ligaments in a game against Utah last March.  
He hopes to begin playing in games in about two weeks.   

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/07/00 
 The Atlanta Journal Constitution is reporting that Mutombo will definitely 
play on Thursday night against the Suns.  He missed most of the preseason and 
the first four games of the regular season after suffering a mild case of 
malaria.   

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/07/00 
 Sprewell was told to watch what he says about Chris Webber joining the 
Knicks in a meeting with league officials on Monday.  In the meeting, 
officials described exactly what the NBA's tampering rules were, and how they 
apply to players.  No disciplinary action was taken against the Knicks' 
forward.    

 Darvin Ham , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Ham will miss 3-4 months after undergoing foot surgery on Monday.  He 
injured the foot while going up for a rebound against the Pistons on Saturday 
night.  Ham averaged 6.0 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in his first 
three games of the season.  He will be replaced in the starting lineup by 
either Tim Thomas or Jason Caffey.      

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 11/07/00 
 Doctors have cleared Coleman to return to the court for the Hornets on 
Wednesday against the Magic.  He missed the entire preseason while adapting 
to new medication for his irregular heartbeat.  Head Coach Paul Silas said 
that Coleman wouldn't start Wednesday's game, but that he would get some 
playing time.    

 Rick Brunson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Celtics on Monday after the team released Greg 
Minor.  He played in 54 games over the past two seasons with the Knicks, and 
was waived by the Miami Heat after this preseason.

broken ankle today and is expected to miss 6-8 weeks  which for most Fantasy

Chat Morton is the rookie from USC who filled in  for Williams. But he's 
short (5' 8"" and light 187#)? and I don't think this  is a situation like 
Denver where the backup RB will step in and perform almost  as well as the

88,"Hola Hermano,

How are you? I have been busy ever since trying to get everything in order
to leave. I think they want to get as much work out of me as possible until
I leave, not that I blame them. It even doesn't make me mad because I
haven't had time to think about it. Anyway the work has also been more
interesting in the last two months than the two before I left for holidays.

I now find myself in peculiar situation similar to maybe going off to
school. I am leaving somewhere where I have made a lot of close friends and
had heaps of great, and trying experiences and am preparing for the next
step in life, oh no a CAREER, ouch that hurts. I however am excited on where
this new road may lead me and as you know man I am ready to come home. I
sure wish you could have been here for the going a way party, it was so
fantastic, other than not getting laid. I am so tired of these foreign know
it all, fascist, snobby, anorexic, egotistical, meniacal, deceptive, nose
ring wearing, no dancing, big shoe sporting, tasteless,  putas! I really
can't wait to meet some nice Texas girls or someone with similar interest.

I miss you a lot too and can't wait to have some nice parties and dinners as
well, I am more of a budding Chef. My guitar playing is getting a little
better. So what's the scoop. Anything happening in work, relationship,
houseshopping, fishing hunting. So what's up there. Mom says you're working
like crazy and occasionally looking for a house. How's that going. I can
tell you, it never fails. No matter where I go I seem to run into decisions
all with the same gravity, I guess if there is third guarantee in life it is
decisions. If you haven't finished by the time I return I would like to help
you

I can't wait! I have had a great time here but I really am ready to return
home. I know now I never wish to permanenetly live outside of Texas. Anyway
I'm so busy packin and taking care of paperwork and contracts and bla bla
bla it takes all my time! My last day of work is Next Wednesday (28th) and
then I will travel and visit some friends for about three weeks. This
weekend, since I'm not at home for Mardi Gras I will go to visit a Thomas in
Cologne Germany and go to one of the greatest Karnival Celebrations in the
world. The following weekend my flatmate David and I are off to Rome and
then Budapest (Hungary). Then the last week (on my home) I will leave Zurich
on the 15th of March and stop off in Den Hague and Amsterdam (Holland) for 6
days to visit Natalie. Well I am not leaving for a while and will constantly
have acces to the internet so write back and let me know how things are
going. All the best on at work and on finding a house und so weiter. By the
way I am searching for some jobs there have you heard from anyone or can I
write to anyone?

Love ya bro,
Travis

Harassment Prevention Training

This training is mandatory for all Enron employees employed since the last 
seminar was conducted  in late 1998 or early 1999.  Those who have already 
attended Enron harassment avoidance training will be offered a refresher 
course in avoiding and preventing harassment.

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training.  

The dates and times available for the sessions are:


 Friday, Feb 23; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15
  Monday Mar 5; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15; 4:30 - 6:00

NO SURRENDER, YET

Al-Qaeda fighters holed up in the Tora Bora area of AFGHANISTAN showed
no sign of surrender, despite punishing American bombing. A new deal
was offered to al-Qaeda diehards: surrender Osama bin Laden and his
close comrades and go free. Some thought Mr bin Laden had fled to
Pakistan.

- - - - - See article: How to keep the peace in Afghanistan
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36746_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_6d

France said it was ready to commit troops to a multinational
PEACEKEEPING FORCE in Afghanistan. Britain was set to lead it, although
Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister, said that many details still had
to be resolved.

A Somali militia leader alleged that the al-Qaeda terrorist network was
moving its operations to SOMALIA, a mostly Muslim country in a state of
chaos. American officials said that they were investigating, but played
down the possibility that military strikes were imminent.

John Ashcroft, America's attorney-general, charged a Moroccan-born
Frenchman with conspiring with al-Qaeda to carry out the SEPTEMBER 11TH
TERRORIST ATTACKS. Zacarias Moussaoui, who had undertaken pilot

Israel ended all direct contact with YASSER ARAFAT and struck at
Palestinian police stations and other targets after ten Israelis in a
bus had been killed by gunmen near a Jewish settlement in the West
Bank. A Fatah militia group and Hamas both claimed responsibility for
the attack, saying that it was in revenge for recent killings of
Palestinians by Israel's forces. Mr Arafat moved to close down all
Hamas and Islamic Jihad offices.

SAUDI ARABIA'S interior minister, Prince Nayef, announced that for the
first time identity cards, carrying photographs of their unveiled
faces, would be issued to Saudi women under certain conditions.
Hitherto, a woman has been named only as a dependant on the card of her
father or husband.

Ruud Lubbers, the UN high commissioner for REFUGEES, accused
governments of basing their policies towards the world's 22m refugees
on ""fear and mistrust"".

Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, announced that a long-awaited
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION will be held in March.

YESTERDAY'S TREATY

President George Bush said he would give Russia notice that America
will withdraw from the 1972 ANTI-BALLISTIC MISSILE TREATY. Mr Bush said
the treaty was written in a ""different era for a different enemy"".

A presidential commission unanimously backed three recommendations that
would allow young workers to invest part of their SOCIAL SECURITY
contributions in the stockmarket. The decision came as concerns grew
over financing the retirement years of the baby-boom generation. The
chances of action seem slim.

Police in Los Angeles arrested two leaders of the JEWISH DEFENCE LEAGUE
on charges of trying to blow up a mosque and the office of an
Arab-American congressman.

ITALY RETREATS

Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, gave way to his EU partners
and accepted plans for an EU-WIDE ARREST WARRANT. Italy had objected to
the long list of crimes it would cover. Changes in the Italian
constitution will be needed. Mr Berlusconi's Northern League allies
were dismayed, both by the warrant itself (too much foreign meddling)
and by his readiness to yield to EU pressure.

In advance of an EU SUMMIT at Laeken, in Belgium, the president of the
European Commission, Romano Prodi, attacked members for agreeing to
plans but then not carrying them out (eg, the proposed ""Galileo""
European global-positioning system). EU summits might become mere
high-level talking-shops, he suggested. Become? jeered cynics.

In BRITAIN, dispute arose over urgings by David Blunkett, the home
secretary, that immigrants should do more to adapt to British ways, and
over a report on some race riots earlier this year, which lamented that
brown and white communities live almost entirely apart. He proposed
more emphasis on the use of English, and a new oath of allegiance for
people seeking naturalisation.

An international tribunal in The Hague indicted SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC for
genocide during the early-1990s civil war in Bosnia. The former
Yugoslav dictator refused to plead, calling the charge a ""monstrous
absurdity"".

Fourteen British and Dutch plane-spotters who had been held in prison
in GREECE on charges of spying were offered bail.

KILLING IN INDIA

Five gunmen broke into INDIA'S parliament buildings. In the ensuing
battle, they and at least six other people including policemen, though
no MPs, were killed.

One week after a new government was elected in SRI LANKA, bringing the
prospect of peace talks with the separatist Tamil Tigers, the rebels
attacked a police station and an army post killing ten people. Six
Tigers were reported to have been killed.

Nine hereditary rulers of MALAYSIA chose Syed Sirajuddin, the ruler of
Perlis state, as the country's new king for the traditional term of
five years.

Tung Chee-hwa, picked by China to run the former British colony of HONG
KONG, is to run for a second five-year term.

Jiang Zemin became the first Chinese head of state to visit MYANMAR
since the military junta seized power in 1988. China supplies Myanmar
with most of its arms.

CHEESED OFF WITH CHAVEZ

VENEZUELA came to a standstill in a one-day stoppage organised by
private business and backed by labour in protest at decrees issued by
President Hugo Chavez. The president threatened to ""turn the screws"" on
the opposition.

96,"Dear Investor,

I'm writing to expose the biggest lie in technology
today...

...one that has individual investors completely in the
dark about an opportunity of immense proportions.  A
LOW-RISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money
by this time next year -- then make your fortune
several times over in the years to come.

I've just put the finishing touches on an Urgent
Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity
and in just a bit, I'll tell you how to get your
FREE copy.

But first, back to technology's biggest lie.  I'm
talking about the so-called ""glut"" of fiber optic
cable.  Here's the REAL story:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet
slowed down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact,
it nearly came to a grinding halt!  That means there
isn't nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into
the system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried
about this problem.  After all, this is the second
time it's happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in
Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore
our economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's
how banks and brokerages transfer funds...how
dispatchers route fleets of trucks...how many Americans
get paid through direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one
example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently
said they're 60% loaded on their network.  That
doesn't sound too bad...until you understand how these
networks operate.  You can't load a network much past
65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually CATASTROPHIC --
because the network spends so much time searching for
open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually
sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation
comes to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed
world.  Internet traffic systems currently run faster
in Australia, Europe and even South America.  That's
because we push out more data than everyone else --
but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the
needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up
fast!  Otherwise business, the economy and our
national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a
""fiber glut?""  Because  95% of all the fiber that has
ever been laid is ""dark"" -- that is, it's not
activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1
supplier of the components needed to do the job.  I'm
looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by this time
next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly
has ""ten-bagger"" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was
nearly 20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government
is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending
into the economy; interest rates are practically zero;
and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore
-- it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time
if you miss out. Get this company's name -- and full
details -- in my urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times
Richer By 2007.  It's yours FREE, simply for accepting
a 100% RISK-FREE trial subscription to my TECHNOLOGY
INVESTING advisory.

TAKE a full six months to measure the value of my
advice for yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't
make the profits you want, just cancel, and your
subscription doesn't cost you a dime.   That's reason
enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right -- and
I'm staking my reputation and my own money on this
call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At
least take a look at TECHNOLOGY INVESTING to see what
you think.  Our unusual six-month guarantee of total
satisfaction means my advisory costs you nothing if
you don't 100% approve.

TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's
already UP 43% since October 1st, in recognition of
this company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is
strained to the limits.  And get this -- data traffic is
DOUBLING every year now.  That means a network
running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the
fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be lit.
Click here to take advantage of this opportunity now.

Angela Sprock forwarded your VM to me regarding the VAR training that you 
were looking to set up for your group.

I've taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them 
about the request and their availability. As well as discussing putting on 
the 2 day course solely for you group, I also discussed with them the 
possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter  modules. Although 
they considered this, they are insistent that the course structure, the 
activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format. 
They are a very busy company, in much demand both within Enron and other 
companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September 
21-22.

Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October 
onwards - but that may be less of a fit).

How does this fit with your group?
Let me know if you want to discuss this further

117,"We have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the 
DPR: 

Return on VaR (ROVAR)
Curve Shift P&L (Delta - Gamma) Sharpe Ratio
Risk - Return (Large)
Risk - Return (Small)

All of these graphs deal with the concept of risk-adjusted return.  The 
markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics.  Furthermore, 
Enron's appetite for risk also differs in each market.  As a result, it is 
difficult to compare returns in absolute terms.  Therefore, the approach of 
these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk, in effect restating 
return numbers into a standard base (how many dollars we earn for every 
dollar we put at risk).


 For each business unit or commodity group, the ROVAR graph shows an average 
of daily total P&L divided by an average of daily VaR.  Higher ROVARs 
indicate better performance (relative to other business units).  For each 
business unit or commodity group there are two bars: the dark blue on the 
left shows ROVAR on a 4 week (20 business day) rolling basis, and the light 
blue on the right shows ROVAR on a 1 week (5 business day) rolling basis.  
Because of the shorter term, the 1 week ROVAR is more sensitive: it can be 
quite high or low, and it changes frequently.


The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept; it shows an average of 
daily curve shift P&L (both delta and gamma) divided by its standard 
deviation. This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non-trading P&L (like new 
deals, reserves, and so forth).  Furthermore, whereas VaR is a forward 
looking statistic (the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given 
probability), standard deviation is backward looking (the actual volatility 
of our returns over the period). This graph also has two bars for every 
business unit or commodity group: a dark brown on the left showing the Sharpe 
ratio on a 4 week rolling basis, and a light brown on the right showing the 
ratio on a 1 week basis.

The Curve Shift P&L Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other 
well.  They measure different things, but if our P&L is composed mostly of 
curve shift, and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift volatility, the two 
statistics should be very close.


Sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the P&L relative 
to the risk.  We therefore put together the Risk - Return graphs.  On the 
vertical axis, they show 4 week rolling average P&L.  On the horizontal, they 
show 4 week rolling average VaR.  The various business units are plotted as 
points on the graphs.  These graphs are closely related to the 4-week ROVARs, 
in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is 
the business unit's ROVAR (average P&L / average VaR).  Another way of 
looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin 
(0,0) with the plotted point of a business unit is its ROVAR.  Books with 
small risks and returns (< $2 million) are plotted on the ""Small"" graph, and 
the rest, on the ""Large"".

These graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize and 
capture the information that is reported in the DPR.  Most, but not all of 
the information in the DPR currently flows from the database.  As a result, 
we do not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit.  As we 
continue to set up exports into the database, we will fill in the missing 
numbers.

We will e-mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the 
intra-net.  Please remember to launch the file in Excel, instead of using the 
Lotus Notes viewer.  The VaR Limit Usage graphs that we created last week are 
already on the web.  We hope that you find all of these useful.

140,"On Wednesday, October 20th, I contacted Ms. Barbara Bernacik at the Office of 
the Pueblo of Laguna, Division of Environment. I contacted Ms. Bernacik at 
the suggestion of Norm Gonzales (TW Laguna Team) to discuss outstanding 
environmental issues at the Station. 

In a conversation with Norm the previous week, Norm indicated to me that he 
had met with Ms. Bernacik and Ray Lucero (Engineer, Pueblo of Laguna) 
recently in regards to backfilling an open excavation which had been 
excavated in 1993 when a diesel UST was removed from the site. The excavation 
had not been backfilled pending authorization from the Pueblo of Laguna. This 
and other outstanding issues were discussed in a meeting with Ray Lucero, the 
Governor of the Pueblo of Laguna, Ted Ryther, Larry Campbell, Butch Russell, 
and myself back in 1995 but there was no resolution of the issues, primarily 
because at the time the Laguna's did not have an environmental staff person 
to address such issues. Subsequently, Ms. Bernacik was hired as the Laguna's 
environmental staff person about two years ago. 

In the course of Norm's conversation with Ms. Bernacik and Mr. Lucero, Mr. 
Lucero indicated some concern that the Pueblo of Laguna had not been kept 
apprised of environmental issues at the Station. In light of this, I have 
prepared a ""Report of Groundwater Monitoring Activities"". This report covers 
monitoring activities between June 1994 and June 1999. As previously 
mentioned, I also contacted Ms. Bernacik for the purpose of introducing 
myself and to inform her that a report has been prepared and will be 
delivered to her office. I also suggested that we meet at the site to discuss 
outstanding environmental issues. The response from Ms. Bernacik was very 
favorable and we agreed to meet at the site at 10:00 am November 16th. Ms. 
Bernacik also indicated that someone from the BIA will be with her.",Barbara Bernacik Bernacik Norm Gonzales Norm Ray Lucero Ted Ryther Larry Campbell Butch Russell Laguna Lucero,,"the Office of

141,"Hi Larry,

Thanks for completing the diamond information request form at 
http://www.DSOURCEVA.com

I did a preliminary search and found the following diamonds for you to 
consider.  There were many extremely nice diamonds at prices substantially 
below your budget so I have include a longer recommendation list than usual.  
This selection should help you determine what is the best value for you.

We filter out the 80 to 90% of diamonds that are cut poorly and only present 
to our customers diamonds that have great cut because we know that cut is the 
primary factor in a diamond's beauty, especially sparkle and fire.

With a round diamond, millimeter measurements are more important than the 
actual carat weight with regard to appearance. More carat weight does not 
necessarily mean more size.  For example, diamonds with depth percentages 
less than 60% will generally have a larger diameter, for the same carat 
weight, than those with depth percentages greater than 60% even though both 
diamonds could be ideal cut.  While we search for diamonds in the top cut 
classes, the preferred combination of depth and table percentages is a matter 
of personal taste and choice.  The three measurement numbers are the longest 
diameter, shortest diameter, and depth in millimeters.  The three letter 
codes after the measurement numbers are the Polish, Symmetry and Fluorescence 
ratings.

Prices in parenthesis are cash discount prices for wire transfers that are 3% 
reduction from credit card prices.  We need to check certification to assess 
specifications marked with ? below.

I've given you a little variety to consider because you need to decide on 
what your priorities are for the right diamond for you.

Which of these diamonds would you like us to order in for inspection?  If 
none of these is what you are looking for, what is it that you would like to 
see different?  The more feedback you can give us, the more effective we can 
be at finding the diamond of your dreams.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

These diamonds were available as of Monday and we have copies of the 
certifications that we can share with you via email at your request.  High 
quality, well cut diamonds like these do not stay on the market long.  If you 
are interested in one of these diamonds, please let us know quickly so we can 
request the wholesaler put it on hold for us.

If you are looking for a really spectacular mounting, check out our favorite 
manufacturer's online catalog at http://www.18karati.com where you can click 
on Catalog then click on Wedding Rings to see pictures of some of the best 
craftsmanship in the industry.  This is a manufacturer's web site so there 
are no prices listed.  If you see something you like, give us the item 
numbers and we will get price quotes that are a fraction of regular retail 
prices.  Our customers have been thrilled with the quality and beauty of 
these mountings so we can highly recommend them to you.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

146,"Four of the six new monitor wells at the Laguna C/S have accumulated 
groundwater. Groundwater samples were collected from these wells on April 
5th. Lab results indicate elevated concentrations of halogenated organic 
compounds in samples collected from two of the wells. Three replacement wells 
will be drilled for the two wells which do not produce water and for one of 
the wells which only has two feet of water in the screen interval. The 
installation of the replacement wells is tentatively scheduled for the week 
of May 8th. A feasibility study for active remediation measures in the former 
impoundment area has been completed.  
The Lockridge semiannual groundwater sampling was completed.  Results will be 
forwarded to the state of Texas.
The quarterly groundwater sampling at the NNG Gomez Plant was completed. The 
recovery system was shutdown from January 17th through April 21st in order to 
evaluate the accumulation rate of PSH in recovery wells. The accumulation 
rate of PSH has been reduced considerably from the accumulation rate prior to 
active remediation. The system was re-started on April 21st and will be 
operated in a similar manner as it was operated prior to the shutdown. 
Transwestern Pipeline Company met with officials of PG&E to discuss recent 
sampling activities on the PG&E system with respect to PCB's.  Results of the 
sampling efforts have shown that PCB's have moved downstream into existing 
interconnects and into lines which feed customers.  PG&E has indicated that 
they will install small filter separators at these interconnects at pricing 
thus far of around $2MM.  This does not include the costs for the mainline 
filter separators which should be in service in June of this year.   PG&E has 
indicated that they will continue sampling at downstream locations to further 
determine the ""front of PCB's""

were as follows:

Home Officing- Employees within OTS and EHS have been asked to pilot a 
telecommunicating and home officing program.  The reson being to make 
available desirable office space within the Enron, Three Allen Center and 
Brookhollow office buildings.

MIke Terraso's Replacement-    John Shafer has been selected to replace Mike 
Terraso as V.P. of GPG for Environmental and Safety.  John was formerly 
Director of Environmetnal and Safety for ANR Pipeline out of Chicago, Ill.  
John will assume responsibilities within Enron on May 8.

Performance Testing of Grandfathered Units-   There was some confusion with 
repsect to the internal position within GPG of testing grandfathered units.  
It was understood by some team members that internal portable emissions 
testing would only occur if the grandfathered unit had permitted limits on an 
air permit  or if there was a special need by the DES.  In order to clarify 
this issue, Bill will discuss this with legal and distribute a notice to the 
appropriate individuals within GPG outlining the GPG position on testing . 

Skill Base Pay- Bill is suggesting a reworking of the O&M, field trainee, and 
Level I, II and III training modules and TV Guides by the SBP review 
committee.  Bill will distribute to the committee existing documents for 
reworking and revision.  The committee will reveiw, make changes and return 
back to Bill by the mid term review meeting.

O&G MACT-    Bill will approach Marc Phillips about conducting an internal 
training for all DES personal on the forthcoming notification and conditions 
of the Oil and Gas MACT regulation and its applicability to the facilities in 
GPG.  Bill will notify each DES as to when the meeting is scheduled and 
where.  An Enron letter will be developed and distributed to the field by 5/5 
to notify EPA of those facilities which are impacted by the new MACT 
regulations.  It will be the DES's responsibility to make the notification to 
the EPA.

MId Term Peer Review Meeting-   Bill Kendrick, Rick Cates and Ken Crowl will 
keep the DES's apprised of the details relevant to the mid term review 
process and procedures to be employed for doing the review.

Cooling Tower Issue-     A request was made by BIll Kendrick to send legal a 
list of histortic or active cooling tower sites within GPG, that may have 
impacted groundwater at a site.   The criteria to be used for this 
notification is knowledge of chromate use in the cooling tower and/or  
relative proximity to a nearby recptor (drinking water well). 

Tracking Cleanup Costs-    MIke Terraso has requested work orders to be 
generated for tracking costs associated with cleanup and remedation of spills 
and releases.  The ""cut line"" for the work order generation is $1,000.

TURQUOISE: DECEMBER'S BIRTHSTONE
======================================
The highest ranking among all the opaque stones, turquoise-
the ""Turkish stone""-is highly prized throughout Asia and Africa,
not for its particular hoe of blue (a beautiful robin's egg or
sky blue) but more important for its supposed prophylactic and
therapeutic qualities.  The Arabs consider it a lucky stone and
have great confidence in its benevolent action.  Used in rings,
earrings, necklaces, head ornaments and amulets, it protects the
wearer from poison, reptile bites, eye diseases, and the evil
eye.  It was also believed capable of warning of impending death
by changing color.  Buddhists revere the turquoise because it is
associated with a legend in which a turquoise enabled Buddha to
destroy a monster.  Even today it is considered a symbol of
courage, success, and love.  It has also long been associated
American Indian jewelry and art.

Turquoise is an opaque, light to dark blue or blue green stone.
The finest color is an intense blue, with poorer qualities
tending toward yellowish green.  The famous Persian turquoise,
which can be very intense and pleasing blue, is considered a
very rare and valuable gem.  The United States (Arizona and New
Mexico) is also an important source of fine turquoise, and is
now the major source of turquoise used in jewelry worldwide.

All turquoises are susceptible to aging and may turn greenish
or possibly darker with age.  Also, care must be taken when
wearing, both to avoid contact with soap, grease, or other
materials that might discolor it, and to protect it from abuse,
since turquoise scratches fairly easily.

But exercise caution when buying turquoise.  This is a
frequently simulated gem.  Very fine glass imitations are
produced that are difficult to distinguish from the genuine.
Very fine adulterated stones, and reconstructed stones (from
turquoise powder bonded in plastic) saturate the marketplace, as
does synthetic turquoise.  Make sure you are buying ""genuine,
natural turquoise.""


THE DRESDEN DIAMOND: GREEN GLORY
=================================
The legendary 40.70 carat Dresden green diamond is now on
display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.,
right next to the Hope diamond, until January 10th of next
year--thanks to Ronald Winston, son of the 20th century's
most famous jewel merchant, Harry Winston.

Today the Dresden is to green diamonds what the Hope is to
blues; the most famous gem of its kind.  Estimated to have
lost at least 60 percent of its original 100-carat-plus
weight during cutting, this green giant takes the prize for
size as well as beauty.

Keep in mind that beauty in green diamonds is nothing like
beauty in emerald, jade, or green grossular garnet.  Natural
green diamonds are extremely uncommon occurrences, the result
of irradiation deep within the earth.  And when they are found,
most are pale in color and light in tone, running a hue
spectrum from apple to algae green.  Don't expect these
diamonds to sport stop light or shampoo-green colors.

Nevertheless, the Dresden is a marvel--from a standpoint of
both shading and size.  True, there are green diamonds
without the vibrancy muting gray of the Dresden, but their
far smaller size makes them seem tiny in comparison.  The
Dresden is such a behemoth, at least as far as green diamonds go,
that it sets a standard that will likely never be challenged,
let alone beat.

DO YOU WANT A COLORED GEMSTONE?
==================================
If you have ever wanted a gorgeous colored gemstone but
never knew how to find one, this is your chance to have one
hand picked for you.  In Tucson, Arizona during the first
weekend of February, the country's largest colored gem
trade show brings gem wholesalers from all over the world.
We will be attending the show to hand select the nicest
gems possible for our customers.

There are hundreds of booths of gems including: ruby, emerald,
sapphire, garnet, amethyst, tourmaline, jade, peridot,
spinel, and tanzanite.  If you would like us to add your
name to our shopping list, give us a call and tell us what
you are looking for. Every year we make many customers'
dreams come true as we find terrific values on the highest
quality gemstones in the world.


MEN'S WEDDING BANDS
======================
While there are hundreds, if not thousands, of women's
wedding ring style, there are relatively few common style of
men's rings.  The vast majority of men prefer some type of
comfort fit wedding band.  The term comfort fit comes from
the rounded inside of the ring that helps eliminate the
sharp edges.  Comfort bands come in a variety of finishes
including polished, two tone, hand craved, and milgrain
edges.

For men, the choice seems to focus more on the width of the
band which can range from 2 millimeters wide alll the way
up to 12 millimeters.  Sometimes couples decide to get
matching bands and/or rings but generally each will pick
what they think looks best and is most comfortable to them.

While the current trend is for the use of platinum in
women's wedding rings, men are often surprised how heavy and
expensive a wide man's band is if it is done in platinum.
Yellow and/or white gold is still the preferred metal for men.

Because men tend to wear their rings all the time, the rings
tend to take much more abuse than a women's ring.  A women
will take her ring off to wash her hands, do the dishes,
or fix dinner.  Men leave their rings on to mow the yard,
fix the car, or participate in sports.  This is probably
why you don't see many diamonds in men's wedding bands--
plus the fact that men learn early that most families
can only afford one jewelry lover.

DIAMOND DISTRICT DANGERS
=========================
When we visit with customers, we often hear that they are
contemplating making a trip to the diamond district in New
York to shop for a diamond.  Many people have heard of the
major diamond trading center located on 47th Street in New
York and the myth is that you can get a good deal there.
In reality, the wholesale trading takes place high above
the street in high-security offices hidden from the public.

The vendors on the street are more skilled at taking your
money than anyone you will find in your community.  They
are fast taking, high pressure salesman who specialize in
letting tourist think they are getting a deal.  They often
sell uncertified diamonds and reply on the difficulty of
customers returning to the Diamond District as part of
their sales strategy.

We recommend you never buy from anyone in the Diamond
District in New York unless you are there with a trusted
retailer who takes you to the true dealers who are not
at street level.  Don't become another statistic of one
who got ripped off while trying to get a good deal in
the Diamond District.


ONLY BUY THE CLARITY YOU NEED
=============================
We see more and more customers being told they need
VVS clarity or they will be able to see inclusions in the
their diamond.  Why pay for something you can not see?

For all shapes except emerald, we suggest VS2 or SI1
as your minimum clarity requirement since with an SI1 you
can not see anything with your naked eye.  The truth is
that you can not see the difference between SI1 and all
the higher clarity grades except with a microscope.
Higher clarity than SI1 does not add to beauty of the
diamond, only the rarity and therefore the price.  By
starting with an SI1 clarity you will get a bigger
diamond and have a better selection for getting a great
cut.  The highest clarity grades cost more but are not
necessarily going to appreciate as much as the grades in
most demand such as VS2 and SI1 as explained at
http://www.dsourceva.com/investment.htm on our web site.
The reality is that the first speck of dust that settles
on the diamond has much more visual impact on the beauty of
the diamond than anything in a diamond that is at least a
certified SI1 clarity grade.


50% OFF SALE
========================
You have all seen the billboards and newspaper ads
advertising half off sale at your local jeweler.  It is
not uncommon for stores to mark up items 300-500% so they
can mark them half-price during a sale. It's no great deal
if you are paying 50%, let alone 150% over wholesale.

Don't fall for sales of any kind.  If a dealer can afford
to mark it down, then they marked it up too high at the
start.


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:

FAMOUS DIAMONDS
===============
Name The Star of Sierra Leone
Weight: 968.90 carats rough

Valentine's Day, 1972.   A routine workday at the diamond
mine in Sierra Leone.  Suddenly, a company engineer and a
plant security officer spot something big on the grease table
(grease sticks to diamonds and is used to separate diamonds
from ore).  At first, neither man could believe what they
saw.  There, trapped by the grease, is a huge diamond, the
size of a hen's egg.

When the stone is first offered for sale, none of the sealed
bids reaches the minimum price of more than $2.5 million set
by the government.  Finally, months later, Harry Winston
makes a deal for the Star.  Winston wants a world-class
diamond from his rough.  A 143.20 carat emerald cut is
fashioned, but upon close examination, it reveals inclusions.
Winston changes his mind, deciding that flawlessness is
more important than size.

The big diamond is recut into seven smaller stones, the
largest of which weighs 32.52 carats.  Besides these, the
rough yields 10 other stones ranging from 1.85 to 53.96
carats.  All told, Winston recovers only 238.48 carats, a
staggering loss of almost 75 percent.  But 13 of the 17
finished stones are reportedly flawless.

GEM OF THE DAY
==================================
Keep smiling.  Even when life knocks you flat on your back,
you are still in a good position to look up.

BEWARE OF FRACTIONS
==================================
The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) allows jewelers to round
off diamond weights.  For example, a diamond labeled 3/4 carat
in weight might actually weigh anywhere between .69 and .81
carat.  While these are small weights, the price difference
can be significant.  For instance, if you bought earrings with
G color, SI1 clarity and 3/4 carat in each ear for $5160, you
might have over paid by $1600 if they really weight .69 carats.

Note: Jewelers are also allowed to be off one color and one
clarity grade.  If you don't purchase a certified diamond,
you could find yourself at the short end on weight, color,
clarity and therefore, value.

INTERNET SALES
==================================
Internet shoppers are expected to spend almost $20 billion
online during the 2000 holiday season, nearly double last
year's total of $10.5 billion, according to a recent survey by
the Gartner Interactive Firm.  About half that revenue is
expected to go to U.S. and Canadian e-tailers, with the rest
distributed among firms in Europe and Asia.

Robert Labatt, principal analyst for Gartner's e-Business
Services Unit, credits the increased willingness to do
business online to the e-tailers' extensive efforts in
increasing the customer's comfort level.  Chat rooms and
opportunities to interact with the internet firms are
encouraging more people to try this form of commerce.

DIAMOND GRADING TIPS: FLUORESCENCE
==================================
Fluorescence, if present in a diamond, will be indicated on
a diamond grading report.  It will be graded very faint,
faint, medium, strong, or very strong.  Some reports
indicate the color of fluorescence as blue, yellow, white,
and so on.  A stone with yellow fluorescence should sell
less since it will appear yellower than it really is when
worn in daylight or fluorescent lighting.  The presence of
blue fluorescence will not detract, and in some cases may
be considered a bonus since it may make the stone appear
whiter than it really is in daylight or fluorescent
lighting.  However, if there is very strong fluorescence,
there may be an oily or milky appearance to the diamond.
We recommend avoiding medium or strong fluorescence since
it is just not worth taking the chance of lower value.


BOW TIE
=======
One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning
in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie, or butterfly effect,
a darkened area across the center or widest part of the
stone, depending upon the cut.  The bow tie is commonly
seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any
fancy shape.  Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will
exhibit some minimal bow tie effect.  Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper
proportioning.  In poorly proportioned stones there is a
pronounced bow tie; the more pronounced, the poorer the
proportioning.  The less pronounced the bow tie, the better
the proportioning.  The degree to which the bow tie is
evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make (cut).


DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS
=========================
One of the best ways to be a better shopper for diamonds and
fine jewelry is to read one or more of the great books
listed at the following web page:

Temporary Extraordinary Procedures and requesting me to reissue ECA20000907A.
Immediately following the memorandum is the ECA itself.  It now carries the
number ECA20001208A.  The memorandum and the ECA are also being posted on the
OASIS.



MEMO


Date:          December 8, 2000

From:          William J. Museler, President & Chief Executive Officer

To:       Steven J. Balser, Manager of Market Monitoring and Performance
James H. Savitt, Market Monitor

Re:       Extraordinary Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw:
HAM Transactions Failing Checkout (ECA 20001208A; re-issuance of ECA
20000907A)


Thank  you  for  the  presentation of the Market Monitoring and Performance
Unit  and  the Market Advisor regarding the progress that has been made with 
the
Market  Participants  in addressing the market design flaw concerning import 
and
export   transactions,  including  wheel-through  transactions,  that  fail  
the
check-out procedure between the completion of BME and the SCD operating 
hour.  I
am  pleased  that  the  Business  Issues Committee gave unanimous support to 
the
NYISO  to  re-issue ECA 20000907A until the Market Participants can consider 
and
approve,  and  the  NYISO can implement, a tariff change required to 
permanently
address the Market Design Flaw.

As  stated in my Memorandum to you of September 6, 2000, I agreed with your
conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a 

?Market Design
Flaw?  as  defined  in  Attachment  Q  to  the ISO OATT, Temporary 
Extraordinary
Procedures  for  Correcting  Market  Design  Flaws  and  Addressing 
Transitional
Abnormalities (the ?TEPs?).  As further stated in that Memorandum, I agreed 
with
your  analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw 
would,
absent  appropriate action, remain at levels different from what would 
otherwise
occur during periods of efficient competition.

I  have  now  determined,  based  on  consultations  with ISO Staff and the
support  of the Business Issues Committee, that it is appropriate to maintain 
in
effect  the  corrective measures adopted as ECA 20000907A while consultation 
and
cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is 
on-going
to  develop  and  implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance 
with
the ISO Agreement.

Please re-issue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action (?ECA?) and
post  it  on  the  OASIS,  for implementation effective at the expiration of 
ECA
20000907A.  The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety (90) days.



William J. Museler, President and CEO
New York Independent System Operator


cc:  Market Participants via OASIS

New York Independent System Operator

Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208A:

Market Design Flaw Regarding HAM Transactions Failing Checkout


Applicability

This Extraordinary Correction Action (ECA) shall apply to:

?    Import and export transactions;
?    that are scheduled for an operating hour in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM) 
by
the Balancing Market Evaluation (BME); and
?    that fail checkout for reasons within the control of the Market
Participant, or that are cancelled at the request of said Market Participant.

Wheel-through transactions shall be treated as both an import and an export
transaction, and the relevant Market Participant shall be billed the sum of 
both
financial impacts, as provided below.  This ECA shall not apply to import,
export, or wheel-through transactions that fail checkout due to NYISO error or
action, or neighboring control area operator error or action.

Rationale

Import Transactions: During the HAM resolution, BME reduces commitments for
energy  resources  within  NYCA  to  accept  scheduled  import transactions 
at a
specific  proxy  bus  indicated  by the Market Participant.  Where the 
scheduled
import  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the real-time energy price 
at
the  proxy  bus  may  be  elevated  above the HAM price due to the failed 
import
transaction.   The  difference  between the real-time price and the BME price 
at
that  proxy  bus is currently charged to all purchasers in the real-time 
market.
Under  this  ECA,  this  amount  (when  positive),  multiplied  by the number 
of
megawatts  of  the  transaction  for  that  hour,  shall be billed to the 
Market
Participant that scheduled the failed import transaction as the financial 
impact
of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Export  Transactions:  During the HAM resolution, BME makes commitments for
energy  resources  to  supply  scheduled  export transactions up to the 
purchase
price  indicated  by the Market Participant at the appropriate proxy bus.  
Where
the  scheduled  export  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  the proxy bus may be depressed below the HAM price due to 
the
failed  export  transaction.   The  difference  between  the  BME  price and 
the
real-time  price  at that proxy bus is currently charged to all loads as part 
of
Schedule  1  costs.   Under this ECA, this amount (when positive), multiplied 
by
the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour, shall be billed to 
the
Market Participant that scheduled the failed export transaction as the 
financial
impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Wheel-Through   Transactions:  During  the  HAM  resolution,  BME  includes
scheduled wheel-through transactions up to the transmission congestion cost 
that
equals  the  decremental  bid  indicated  by  the Market Participant.  Where 
the
scheduled  wheel-through transaction fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  both  the  import  and export proxy busses may be elevated 
or
depressed,  respectively,  due  to the effects on transmission congestion of 
the
failed wheel-through transaction.  Under this ECA, the effects of the import 
and
export  portions  of  the  failed  wheel-through  transaction will be 
calculated
separately,  as though they were separate failed transactions.  The sum of 
those
impacts  shall  be  billed  to  the Market Participant that scheduled the 
failed
wheel-through  transaction  as  the  financial  impact of causing the failure 
to
complete checkout of the transaction.

Implementation Rules


1.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
delivered to the NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity
selling the amount of energy scheduled in BME into the LBMP Market at the
scheduling entity?s BME Bid Price, and buying the energy that was not 
delivered
from the LBMP Market at the Real-Time LBMP prevailing at the external Proxy
Generator Bus.  No payment will be required of the scheduling entity if it is
shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control 
Area
and the energy was not delivered due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
delivering Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the 
Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is lower
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to deliver scheduled energy.

2.   An External Transaction for the receipt of energy from the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
received from NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity 
buying
the amount of energy scheduled in BME from the LBMP Market at the scheduling
entity?s BME Bid Price and selling the energy that was not taken into the LBMP
Market at the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus.  No payment
will be required by the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External
Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not
taken by the scheduling entity due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
receiving Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is 
higher
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to take scheduled energy.

3.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at one
external Proxy Generator Bus and the delivery of energy from the NYCA at a
different external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which 
no
energy is delivered to or received from the NYCA in real-time, will be settled
by applying rules 1 and 2 of this ECA separately to the failed delivery of
energy to the import Proxy Generator Bus and the failed receipt of energy at 
the
export Proxy Generator Bus, and summing the total of the two amounts for 
payment
by the scheduling entity.  No payment will be required by the scheduling 
entity
if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each
Control Area and the energy was not taken by the scheduling entity due to an
error or action by the NYISO or the delivering or receiving Control Area.  No
payment will be required of, or made to the Market Participant for the import 
or
the export portion of the External Transaction if no payment would have been
required had that portion of the transaction been a separate transaction under
rule 1 or 2 of this ECA.

171,"I spoke at length today with Rod Boschee at PG&E.  The main focus of our 
discussion was logistics/planning for the upcoming 4/13/99 meeting between TW 
and PG&E representatives.  Mr. Boschee, as in earlier conversations this 
week, did not mention the 3/25 sample results.  Rather, it was agreed (also 
mandated by his boss, Bill Mazotti) that the time was ripe for a follow-on 
meeting to our initial discussion in Topock back in January.  I provided 
verbal notification to Mr. Boschee that Transwestern had retained an outside 
contractor for purposes of a decontamination process to be accomplished 
tomorrow at our filter separators.  In addition to my verbal notification, I 
told him that TW would provide PG&E with a letter, just to complete the paper 
trail.  I reinforced the importance of communication between the companies, 
both formal and informal.  A copy of the letter I faxed to Mr. Boschee is 
attached below.


Mr. Boschee will be preparing a draft agenda for the 4/13 meeting for TW to 
consider.  In addition to TW providing an update on all interim as well as 
long term plans for the lateral, Mr. Boschee noted two important items.  
First, PG&E would like more information regarding the proposed controlled 
Selexol flush.  Their concern is that the Selexol was colored initially as 
the culprit in this PCB issue, and now is being considered a part of a 
revised interim solution.  Secondly, PG&E would like to discuss the upcoming 
filter change at its station currently scheduled for 4/29.  

We've decided to meet in Las Vegas on 4/13.  The choice of Vegas seemed to be 
more centralized (vs. San Francisco), as well as more convenient for those of 
us travelling all the way from Houston.  PG&E is planning on having the 
following personnel attend the meeting:
 Rod Boschee-  Director of Contract Development
 Dave Anderson-  Attorney
 Mel Wong-  Project Manager, Topock Lateral project
 Jody Garcia-  District Superintendent, Barstow Dist.
 Tony Estrada-  Environmental
 2 as-yet-to-be-named Barstow team members

Transwestern is planning on having the following personnel attend the meeting:
 Jeff Fawcett- Marketing
 Louis Soldano-  Attorney
 Mike Nelson-  VP Operations
 Rich Jolly-  District Ops
 Larry Campbell-  Environmental
 Bob Iversen-  Technical advisor, Selexol/PCB matters
 Earl Chanley-  Engineering

The plan is to take Bill's plane from Houston, pick-up Mike Nelson in 
Amarillo, meet in Vegas, and return (with drop-off in Amarillo) to Houston in 
one day.  I'm coordinating the logistics with Virginia O'Neill.  My guess at 
this point is that we'll plan on being in Las Vegas by 10:30 a.m., with the 
meeting to begin at 11:00 a.m., a working lunch served at 12:00 noon, and 
adjourn somewhere around 2:00 p.m., with a return flight of 2:30 p.m.

Lou Soldano is in receipt of a few of Bill Cordes' suggestions to the letter 
that Bill will send out to Bill Mazotti that will: (1) outline the revised 
Interim Plan, including the Selexol flush, (2) notify him of our initiative 
to decon TW's filter/separators, and (3) reinforce our desire to meet on 
4/13.  If the logistics (KEYEX meeting) can be worked out, the letter will 
probably go out by Friday.

If you have any questions regarding the matters outlined above, please advise.",Rod Boschee Boschee Bill Mazotti Transwestern Dave Anderson-   Mel Wong-   Jody Garcia-   Barstow Dist Tony Estrada-   Barstow Louis Soldano-   Mike Nelson-   Larry Campbell-   Bob Earl Chanley-   Bill Mike Nelson Virginia O'Neill Lou Soldano Selexol,,PG&E TW Selexol PCB Topock Lateral District Superintendent Transwestern District Ops Selexol/PCB decon TW's KEYEX

I am attaching a graph that shows how the CO emissions increase exponentially
(vppm) as the turbine operating power is lowered.  The 50% base load CO levels
are between 215 and 250 vppm.

This graph also shows a wider ambient temperature range.

As stated on the phone today the 45 vppm NOx levels are achievable across the
entire operating range.

I apologize for the SI units on the graph, but I ran out of time to convert

204,"Would you mind checking into something for me?  One of our lawyers was called by someone from Industrial Markets who was laid off.  He indicated that he had an employment contract that has a six month non-compete for involuntary termination.  He said that he called HR to get a waiver of the non-compete so that he could pursue new employment and was told that no waiver would be granted.  Is that our policy or are these issues being addressed on a case by case basis?  I find it hard to believe that we would even think about enforcing a non-compete for someone we've laid off, so why not grant the waiver?  If this is not the policy, we need to get this straightened out.",,,Industrial Markets

If this group of people or some subset thereof remains at Enron then I think we can get good litigation services from them re: broadband claims.  Call me if you have any questions.  Sherron.

Mortgage rates are still attractive today, according to E-Loan, despite climbing from last year's lows. In fact, current rates are as low as those available for most of last year. With these low rates, you could still benefit by refinancing today. 

It's not too late to save
The Schwab Mortgage Center provided by E-Loan makes it easy to compare your rate to the current market <http://schwab.ed10.net/ud/QHF8/572F/0C6E/ID/D4IQ6M>. So you can quickly find out if refinancing now makes sense for you. 

At today's rates, many homeowners find they can still reduce their monthly payments - and put a little extra cash in their pockets. 

Why wait? Find a rate that's right for you.
Visit the Schwab Mortgage Center provided by E-Loan and get an immediate quote <http://schwab.ed10.net/ud/QHF8/UBLK/0C6E/ID/D4IQ6M>. Or call 1-888-924-2882 to speak directly with an E-Loan consultant.

Northern has reviewed the gas composition for the receipts in the area, and gas received by Northern with a high nitrogen content in this area may not be confirmed for receipt or curtailed, if previously scheduled, in accordance with gas quality specifications in section 44 of Northern's tariff.  If this becomes necessary, the points listed below will be allocated or curtailed in the following order based on the gas stream compostion.    List""

227,"The attachment below is the personal response from Charles Jeffress to NAM's 
request for clarification as to the compliance date for enforcement to 
commence for the OSHA final rule on Ergonomics. 

This credits the proposed Enron Grandfathering plan to have the remainder of 
the time to Oct. 15, 2001 in which to achieve full activation of the written 
plans within each of the Enron companies.

While there are substantial numbers of law suits filed over this final rule, 
the outlook for any satisfactory court action is unlikely, as is action from 
Congress. Any repeal actions from a new OSHA administration would likely take 
longer than Oct. 15, 2001 to become effective.

Russ and Carol Blaser were celebrating a friend's 40th birthday with his wife by eating out in Cedar Key, Florida.  They flew out to Cedar Key and were intending to fly back to Gainesville after the celebratory dinner.  Russ Blaser was an accomplished and experienced pilot and in fact had participated in many air shows with his stunt plane.   
 
Shortly after takeoff from Cedar Key, the plane Russ was flying crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. Richard's mom was killed and his father has not yet been found. 
 
The date for the funeral of Carol Blaser has not yet been set.  I will relay any relevant information regarding funeral arrangements and Russ Blaser's status to those on this email list as they become available.  
 
Please take a moment to think of Rich and his family.

234,"Maybe I'm not looking at this appropriately, but why didn't the deferred taxes on the balance sheet disappear as of the date of sale to Dynegy?  My understanding is that the Option provided for a Section 338h10 basis step-up.  That would result in NNG's paying off its deferred taxes as of the transfer date.  I'm particularly interested in knowing how NNG will pay those taxes given that the note with Corporate can only be reduced to $240MM plus accrued dividends.  That tax election complicates the accounting significantly.

253,"Guess I was lazier still.  Agree with your assessment, I just neglected to 
recalc your model in order to determine growth rates necessary to get cash 
flows high enough to justify $14 and $28.  31% and 40% growth rates are (I 
would argue) wildly unrealistic.  In addition, the capex numbers would 
(presumably) have to bump up substantially in order to get you there.  
Therefore, I would argue in the memo that the numbers don't add up for a $28 
price (though ""irrational exuberance"" may permit Netscape to pull it off).  
Unless other folks have comments on the model, I think you're good to go for 
the memo.  Am ready to look at it when you've got a draft.  Great job on the 
case.  Thanks.

261,"Madam Chairwoman,

My name is Gary Ackerman, and I am the Executive Director of the Western
Power Trading Forum.  My forum is a California trade association whose
29 members are buyers, sellers, and exchanges of wholesale and retail
electric power.

We are here today to support the elements of the Community Choice
model.  A workably competitive market is one that has many buyers and
sellers.  Today we have a market with many sellers, but few buyers.  The
Community Choice model provides for many buyers of power, unlike the
present situation where the market is dominated by three; PG&E, SCE, and
SDG&E.  These three buyers represent about 87% of the load in the
restructured electricity market, the balance of which is provided by a
handful of competitive Energy Service Providers.

Community Choice will allow city governments to procure on behalf of
their constituents energy which meets their local energy needs.
Long-term contracts for energy and energy services will be written with
credit-worthy suppliers such as Enron, APS Energy Services, Newwest
Energy, and Green Mountain dot com who will compete to win the business.
""Demand responsiveness"" will be created through the innovation that
these sellers will utilize in order to win new business. Cities will be
able to cooperate with bidders to analyze their loads, and sellers will
be motivated to embrace and offer distributed generation, conservation
measures, and enhanced metering technologies.

Imagine a State whose people within a well-defined geographical boundary
are able to select their default provider.  This is the vision of
Community Choice.  It will bring stability and order to our very
successful spot energy exchanges: the California PX Day-Ahead Market,
and APX=01,s  green energy market. These spot markets will continue to grow
and flourish, and continue to provide instantly transparent prices to
eveyone, just as they do today.  However, with only two or three
dominant buyers as we have now, these spot markets may atrophy, and may
perish.  Dominant buyers are able to redirect their volumes from these
exchanges on a whim, causing tremendous swings in volume, additional
price volatility, and a great deal of uncertainty, and instability when
it is least needed.  Alternatively, when there are many buyers, all of
whom are accountable to their local citizenry, and all of who seek a
reasonable balance between spot purchases, and term purchases, the
situation will become more stable, efficient, and less prone to sudden
changes.

We encourage this Committee to take a hard look at Community Choice as a
way to share the benefits of competition, keep the State on its
progressive course, and provide a timely correction to a system that
will earn the trust and confidence of the public.

Thank you

Clinton Pledges Support for Californians
Under Pressure From High Electric Bills
A WSJ.COM News Roundup
WASHINGTON -- President Clinton said he has asked federal regulators to look 
into the possibility that California electricity producers have engaged in 
profiteering this summer.
Asked Wednesday if he thought the power companies were unfairly taking 
advantage of the power shortages in California he responded, ""Well, that's 
what the [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is] going to investigate.""
Mr. Clinton also announced other steps to help consumers in Southern 
California deal with ""skyrocketing"" electric bills and called on Congress to 
pass legislation to ""build a better energy future over the long run.""
""We'll do what we can to help you get through this summer,"" Mr. Clinton told 
Californians, referring especially those in the San Diego area where the 
price crunch has been most severe.
Speaking on the steps overlooking the Rose Garden moments before leaving for 
a political fund-raising trip to New Jersey, Mr. Clinton said he has ordered 
these steps:
The FERC has been asked to quicken the pace of its investigation into 
wholesale power markets ""so we can better understand what's happening in 
California and provide policy-makers with the information they need to 
protect consumers in a timely fashion."" 
The Department of Health and Human Services will release $2.6 million to 
Southern California families from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance 
Program. Mr. Clinton said that doubles the amount of aid available in the San 
Diego area and will help low-income families and the elderly ""to pay their 
bills and stay cool."" 
The Small Business Administration has been told to put out the word about SBA 
loans ""to help cope with unusually high electrical bills."" 
Residential and business customers who receive power from the San Diego Gas 
and Electric Co., a unit of Sempra Energy, have seen their bills double or 
even quadruple since rates were deregulated in June.
The phased-in, south-to-north deregulation of California's $20 billion 
electrical power industry was supposed to lower prices by creating greater 
competition.
But demand for electricity has outstripped supply because of a growing 
population and a booming high-tech economy and less power available from 
neighboring states that haven't deregulated. A sweltering summer in 
California has contributed to the problem.
Mr. Clinton said the problem has a broader base than just the current price 
crunch in southern California.
""I also renew my call to Congress to work with us to build a better energy 
future over the long run, to take up my energy budget initiatives and the tax 
incentives to promote energy efficiency and conservation,"" the president said.
""I hope they will also pass a national comprehensive bill to foster a new era 
of the right kind of competition in the electric industry, to establish a 
more competitive, efficient and reliable electric power system for our nation 
and to beef up efforts to prevent utilities from abusing their market power 
to raise rates above competitive levels,"" he said.
Mr. Clinton said those steps would save American consumers about $20 billion 
a year.
Responding to questions, Mr. Clinton was asked about high gasoline prices and 
what the U.S. is doing to convince oil-producing nations to increase 
production at lower prices.
He said he will discuss the issue on his trip to Nigeria, a big oil producer, 
later in the week and that renewed economic growth elsewhere in the world is 
""putting more pressure on the oil supplies that are available.""
Mr. Clinton said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will 
suffer if high oil prices trigger regional recessions, causing oil purchases 
to drop dramatically.
He said OPEC will be much better off at a lower, sustainable oil price.
""They don't want to go down to $13 to $15 a barrel again, but it needs to be, 
I think, in the low $20s somewhere,"" Mr. Clinton said, calling that ""the more

Power-Lines Deal
Davis, Edison come to terms but PG&E remains a balky holdout 
Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Saturday,?February 24, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/24/M
N184206.DTL 
Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday he had reached an agreement with Southern 
California Edison to put the state's financially ailing utilities back on 
their feet - but Pacific Gas and Electric Co., crucial to any deal, remained 
a holdout. 
The key to the deal is state purchase of utility transmission lines, which 
would help the companies pay off debt they piled up selling electricity for 
less than it cost them. Edison will part with its lines for $2.76 billion, 
Davis said. 
But PG&E is reluctant to sell, and the governor said no deal will work 
without PG&E. 
In addition to agreeing to sell its transmission lines, Edison said it would 
produce inexpensive power to sell to the state for the next 10 years. 
At a news conference in Los Angeles, Davis said the agreement in principle 
with Edison ""provides value to both sides. The utility gets the financial 
wherewithal to go back into business and keep our lights on. We get 
commensurate value in specific benefits, which provide us long-term power at 
very cheap rates."" 
Davis' framework for righting California's wobbly energy market, however, 
hinges on a similar agreement with PG&E. Those familiar with the talks 
involving the utility, based in San Francisco, said discussions are moving 
""very, very slowly."" 
""They are adamantly resistant to selling their transmission facilities,"" said 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek. 
Ron Low, a spokesman for PG&E, did not comment on Keeley's statement, but 
after talks concluded Thursday, Low said the two sides were ""very far apart"" 
on some issues. 
In a statement yesterday, PG&E Corporate Chairman Robert Glynn said the 
""discussions were an important milestone in the resolution of California's 
energy crisis."" 
""Each utility's issues and opportunities in this crisis are different, and we 
believe that PG&E has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer 
and shareholder interests,"" Glynn said. ""We are confident that continued 
discussions can achieve a resolution for our company."" 
Davis said he made ""good"" progress with Sempra Energy, the parent company of 
San Diego Gas & Electric, but only ""some"" progress with PG&E. 
Davis ruled out a deal that does not include PG&E. 
""I don't believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without acquiring 60 
percent of the transmission lines. That, in turn, requires us to have an 
arrangement with PG&E,"" he said. The other 40 percent of the grid is owned by 
municipal utilities. 
Keeley said Davis is right to insist that PG&E be part of any deal. 
""I think the deal announced is a good first step, and will hopefully put 
pressure on the other companies,"" Keeley said. 
CRITICS CALL DEAL BAILOUT
The purchase price set for Edison's transmission lines is 2.3 times the 
system's book value. Although critics argue that represents a bailout, 
supporters of the plan say the lines are worth far more than book value. 
For example, the cost to replace all the utilities' transmission lines -- a 
figure that probably would come into play during a possible bankruptcy -- is 
estimated at $20 billion. If the state pays 2.3 times the book value for all 
three utilities' systems, it will pay $7.2 billion total. 
The agreement with Edison follows a framework Davis announced last week. In 
exchange for the purchase of the lines, Edison also agreed to return $420 
million that the utility had sent to its parent company, establish 
conservation easements on 20,000 acres of watershed for 99 years and drop all 
litigation against the state demanding the ability to immediately raise 
rates. 
Edison also agreed to continue to sell the power it produces to the state at 
cost for another 10 years. 
Edison said it still believed that it would have won its lawsuit to recover 
costs through a rate increase. But Edison International Chairman John Bryson 
said, ""This agreement is far preferable to perhaps years of protracted 
litigation."" 
NO RATE INCREASE
Davis continued to insist that the deal would not require a rate increase, 
although he has indicated that the rate increase adopted by the state Public 
Utilities Commission last month -- which was supposed to last 90 days -- 
would stay in place. 
Davis has been under pressure to meet deadlines he has imposed himself for 
making progress in the energy crisis, which he said were designed to reassure 
Wall Street. However, he also had a personal stake in making yesterday's 
announcement, as he left immediately for a five-day trip to the East Coast. 
Davis will spend four days at the National Governors Association in 
Washington, D.C., and a concurrent meeting of the Democratic Governors 
Association, which he chairs. 
Much of his time will be spent reassuring his fellow governors that the 
crisis is under control, as well as meeting with President Bush and Energy 
Secretary Spencer Abraham. 
DAVIS ON 'MEET THE PRESS'
Davis also will use the time to make national media appearances, including 
one on ""Meet the Press"" tomorrow. Garry South, Davis' political strategist, 
said the appearances will allow Davis to address some East Coast media 
accounts of the energy crisis. 
""A lot of misconceptions and myths have crept in,"" South said. ""It's not 
helpful to California; it's not accurate on how the crisis came about and how 
we're trying to solve it."" 
After he leaves Washington, Davis will spend a day in New York to meet with 
Wall Street analysts. Yesterday, he suggested that he would be asking for 
their support in California's quest for revenue bonds to help pay for power 
purchases. 
California will have spent $2.8 billion on power by next month, and its 
credit ratings have been downgraded by some analysts. 
Consumer advocates reacted with skepticism to Davis' tentative deal with 
Edison. 
Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN, The Utility Reform Network, said she 
was displeased with the governor's plan because it commits ratepayers to 
paying off an unidentified portion of utility debt. 
""Nothing says what the final price tag is,"" she said. 
Dealing for Power 
-- Power lines: The state would buy Southern California Edison's transmission 
lines for about $2.7 billion, 2.3 times their estimated book value, to help 
bail out the financially strapped utility. 
-- Helping out: Edison parent Edison International would pay the utility 
about $420 million. 
-- Payback: Edison would drop its lawsuit seeking higher electricity rates 
and would to continue to sell the state cheap power for another 10 years. 
-- The other shoe: ''Some progress'' reported in talks over a similar deal 
with PG&E, which is reluctant to sell its lines.

Other Developments 
ENERGY FORECAST
California enjoyed its second straight day without a power alert. Lori 
O'Donley, spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator said 
continued warm weather around the West and completion of maintenance on some 
power plants that had been out of operation kept the state above the percent 
reserve mark. O'Donley said the state should remain out of the danger zone 
during the weekend. 
MORE MEGAWATTS COMING
Mirant Corp., announced that it signed a contract to provide 750 megawatts of 
power to the state during the month of March. ""We became more confident in 
our ability to enter such a contract after we received full payment from the 
Department of Water Resources for a bill due Feb. 20,"" said Randy Harrison, 
executive director of the company's western operations. 
INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR SETTLEMENT
Three generators reached a settlement with the California Independent System 
Operator to continue to supply emergency power to California until March 18 
even though it is unclear who will pay for much of that power. 
Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Cos. and Dynegy Inc. signed an agreement that 
effectively extended a U.S. District Court judge's temporary restraining 
order that had required the generators to supply power to the power grid 
operators. 
In the meantime, the three generators, along with Duke Energy Corp. and 
Mirant Corp., have asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for an 
emergency order forcing the Independent System Operator to provide a 
creditworthy buyer for their power. 
The federal commission on Feb. 14 told the system operator that it could not 
force generators to take on ""unacceptable financial risks"" by selling without 
a reasonable expectation of being paid. 
CONSERVATION REWARD
State Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, said he will propose legislation to give $1 
billion to customers who conserve on their electricity bills during the 
summer months. Perata claims that his bill, which would pay consumers a $10 
refund for every megawatt hour saved, would reduce the amount of money that 
the state would have to spend buying power on the expensive spot market.

Looks great.  Couple of points:

1) Despite promises to the contrary--common theme in this exercise--Burton 
(as I understand) did not remove the condemnation (expropriation?) language 
from ABx6, i.e., the state can just take your power plant (or anything else, 
it seems), if it has the inkling.  That's an egregious provision in ABx6.

2) I don't recall trying to amend ABx18 to say, ""pay them their PX credits.""  
I understood the tactic to be--get a prospective, date certain end to the 
freeze in the bill, which then gives us very firm legal ground on which to 
seek and get the money owed to us.  We could seek the additional language, 
but if putting date certain does the same thing without attracting a lot of 
attention, may be a preferable path.

3) Forgive me if I've just overlooked it, but I got wind of a bill by Ms 
Migden (ABx8?)  that gives one whole heckuvalot of new power--power usually 
left to FERC--to the CA Electricity Oversight Board.  Anyone know about it?

customers to switch to direct access as easily as possible (without an exit

customers can still elect for DA, but must pay the exit fee.  All customers

taking DWR procured power before they switch to DA.

This will be shown to the coalition now as well.  Our goal is to get

worked out their differences and filed a joint recommendation on October 2.
According to the joint recommendation, which I will fax over to you,
Edison's original proposal was to auction off its SO2 credits.  The joint
recommendation accepts the auction approach, except that if no bids are
received for some credits, then those credits will be retained within the
regulated utility, and any future net proceeds will be credited to
ratepayers.  It appears that Edison's original proposal would have
transferred such no-bid credits to an unregulated affiliate at zero cost.
The joint recommendation also states that any no-bid credits retained by the
regulated utility will be deemed to have been market valued, and will have a
zero market value for purposes of determining transition costs.
No Commission decision has been issued on this matter.  No decision in this

303,"Calif May Be Buying Big Power Supplies At Market's Top
By Mark Golden
  
03/07/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 


NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- When market-savvy energy companies like Enron, Calpine 
and Dynegy are selling like crazy, that might be a sign it's not a good time 
to buy. 


Nevertheless, the state of California is signing contracts for $43 billion 
worth of power under supply deals stretching up to 20 years. Some industry 
experts say these contracts could be overpriced by billions of dollars in a 
matter of months. What's more, deliveries for most of the supplies already 
signed for won't begin until after this summer, which is likely when the 
power will be needed most.


""The state should be involved in portfolio contracts to stabilize costs, but 
signing 10-year and 20-year contracts is inappropriate,"" said Michael Zenker, 
director of western energy consulting services at Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates. ""That could end up locking consumers into higher rates for many 
years to come."" 


The near bankruptcy of California's two largest utilities has forced the 
state to step heavily into the power markets. The state's idea behind signing 
long-term contracts is to stabilize its power costs by spreading them out, 
said Vikram Budhraja, whose company, Electric Power Group, is advising the 
state on the contracts. 


""What we set out to do is get California out of the spot market, bring 
stability to the market and get dependable supplies,"" Budhraja said. ""We 
believe we have done that."" 


But some said California could find cheaper prices for forward power if it 
waits. Power prices will continue to be very volatile for the next 12 months 
to 24 months, but the price of power for delivery in 2002 and beyond is 
likely to begin falling at the end of this summer, said Gerald Keenan, a 
senior partner for PricewaterhouseCoopers' utility consulting group. The best 
approach now is to sign contracts covering just a few months or years, he 
said. 


""It's not a good bet that gas prices will stay high for such a long time,"" he 
said. ""And very little of that power will be delivered this summer anyway.""


This week, California Gov. Gray Davis said the state has nailed down about 
7,000 megawatts for the summer - more than half the difference between 
generation already controlled by the utilities and the projected peak demand 
on a very hot day. 


But contract details released by Calpine Corp. (CPN), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke 
Energy (DUK) and Williams Companies (WMB) belie the governor's claim. 
According to press releases from those generators, only 1,640 MW of the power 
they're selling will be available this summer. 


Not everyone agrees the state has overpaid. To head off a meltdown, 
independent power companies in California are giving the state prices 
slightly below the current forward market, said Gary Ackerman, executive 
director of the Western Power Trading Forum. 


""These are probably good deals,"" said Ackerman, who added that potential 
out-of-state suppliers are seeking higher prices because they don't have the 
same political motivation. ""Never guess at what prices are going to do. They 
can always go higher."" 


Still, California's inability to find much power for this summer means that 
the state's imbalance between supply and demand will have to be solved in the 
near term on the demand side, according to one perspective. Once demand falls 
- whether through higher prices, voluntary conservation, involuntary 
blackouts or even a recession - forward electricity prices in California 
could come crashing down. 


Davis has proposed conservation plans that he says will reduce electricity 
consumption by 10% from expected levels this summer. As part of the 
conservation program, Davis wants to install new real-time meters before 
summer at 43,000 industrial and commercial customers which will then get some 
market prices for their power and would be motivated to reduce consumption 
during peak-use hours. 


The current forward market reflects a skepticism that the meters and other 
conservation efforts will be anywhere near as effective this summer as the 
governor says. But some industry experts say the real-time meters alone could 
reduce power consumption by 10%, which would slash both spot and forward 
supply prices, again reason for the state to wait. 


""The state should absolutely install the meters first before signing the 
long-term contracts,"" Zenker said. 


The governor agreed, when asked about this in his press conference, that 
conservation efforts will weaken forward markets. But he said securing stable 
prices now is worth the cost. 


""Consumers will know approximately what it will cost them for power. The 
first two or three years they will probably pay less than the real cost of 
power. In the next five or six years they may pay a little bit more,"" Davis 
said. ""I think that is a bargain that Californians can learn to accept."" 


Moreover, if the state had signed deals for just a couple of years, the 
average price would be double the $69/average price of the longer-term 
contracts announced this week. Such prices, in turn, would have forced the 
state to raise electricity rates, something that is politically unpalatable, 
Zenker conceded. 


Davis and his staff defended their approach, saying that the problem for this 
summer will be so acute that it requires a multipronged attack rather than 
pursuing demand reductions first. 


""There is no one piece that is going to solve this problem,"" Budhraja said. 
""All have to be pursued simultaneously.""

I think we are suffering from not enough time to fully iterate this, as well 
as little information on what
others are going present.

The basic messages as I see them (and not having trued this up with Mary or 
others) are:

1.  The markets are working consistent with physics and economics; demand is 
up, supplies are down and higher
prices are resulting.
2. Characteristics of the retail markets have resulted in risks being passed 
to end users.  Are such issues
impeding wholesale markets?  If so, perhaps FERC can influence movement in 
this area.
3. We shouldn't equate outcomes at the retail level with bad structure at 
wholesale level.  The key is to
distinguish the retail issues so that FERC can focus on the wholesale issues.
4. Any remaining concerns should be studied further rather than simply 
receiving blame for the outcomes we've
seen:  Whether there is market power?  Whether rather it's a matter of 
scarcity rents?  What are appropriate
scarcity rents?  Is monopsony power on the buyers' side (utilities) causing 
undesirable economic and reliability
outcomes.   (And out of this should be consideration of whether an 
across-the-board $250 cap is the right one,
especially given that the ISO staff itself recognizes that this is a poor 
proxy for what buyers are willing to
pay as scarcity rents.)

That's my 2 cents.  I don't know what Mary's additional thoughts are, nor how 
what other parties will say may
affect what we should emphasize.

Certainly, though, your feedback is invaluable.  If you reply with feedback 
I'll do what I can to see that
Enron's message reflects your preferences.

MERRY CHRISTMAS!

U.S. equity index futures are pointing to a slightly lower open 
in the post-Christmas session as economic and equity news is 
sparse. Wal-Mart (WMT,57,f2&f4) and Echostar Communications 
(DISH,27,f1) were among the few U.S. companies in the headlines 
this morning while U.S. Treasuries are lower and Japanese 
markets rose slightly.

Leading retailer Wal-Mart stated that it anticipates December 
same-store sales at the high end of the 4%-6% range, exceeding 
its previous forecasts. For the Nov. 23 to Dec. 24 period, the 
company said same-store sales were in the mid-to-upper single 
digit percentage range.

According to The Wall Street Journal, EchoStar Communications 
Chairman Charlie Ergen wants to expand Hughes Electronics 
Corp.'s (GMH,15.02,f2) satellite Internet service. If regulators 
approve Echostar's proposed acquisition of Hughes, the Journal 
reported, Ergen plans to postpone a ""full-scale deployment"" of 
the Internet service until 2004, opting to spend $1 billion in 
order to design and launch a ""new generation"" of satellites.

Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. (PFE,40.77,f2) received a 
favorable court ruling related to its antidepressant drug 
Zoloft. A federal judge ruled the company is not liable in the 
case of a man who committed suicide while on the drug, despite 
allegations by the widow that Pfizer failed to disclose possible 
side effects.

the
Economist article at
http://www.economist.com/editorial/freeforall/current/index_fn8276.html
will all the pretty pics and graphs, or the plain text version below.


E-xaggeration: The digital economy is much smaller than you think

NEWSPAPERS and magazines are packed with stories about the digital economy,
the information-technology (IT) revolution and the Internet age. That their
pages are filled with advertising from IT firms presumably has nothing to do
with it. Such firms account for a quarter of the total value of the S&P 500,
and this week Dow Jones announced that Microsoft, Intel and SBC
Communications will be included in its industrial average from November 1st.
Not before time, many say, for high-technology businesses now account for a
huge chunk of the economy. Actually, they don't.
New figures published on October 28th by America's Department of Commerce
appear to support the view that IT is very important to the American
economy. The department now counts all business spending on software as
investment (previously, it was a cost). This has both increased the apparent
size of IT investment and boosted America's rate of growth in recent years.
But measuring the size of the ""new"" economy is a statistical minefield. The
most generous estimate comes from the OECD, which tracks the
""knowledge-based economy"". It estimates that this accounts for 51% of total
business output in the developed economies-up from 45% in 1985. But this
definition, which tries to capture all industries that are relatively
intensive in their inputs of technology and human capital, is implausibly
wide. As well as computers and telecoms, it also includes cars, chemicals,
health, education, and so forth. It would be a stretch to call many of these
businesses ""new"".
A study published in June by the Department of Commerce estimates that the
digital economy-the hardware and software of the computer and telecoms
industries-amounts to 8% of America's GDP this year. If that sounds rather
disappointing, then a second finding-that IT has accounted for 35% of total
real GDP growth since 1994-should keep e-fanatics happy.
Perhaps unwisely. A new analysis by Richard Sherlund and Ed McKelvey of
Goldman Sachs argues that even this definition of ""technology"" is too wide.
They argue that since such things as basic telecoms services, television,
radio and consumer electronics have been around for ages, they should be
excluded. As a result, they estimate the computing and
communications-technology sector at a more modest 5% of GDP-up from 2.8% in
1990. This would make it bigger than the car industry, but smaller than
health care or finance. In most other economies, the share is lower; for the
world as a whole, therefore, the technology sector might be only 3-4% of
GDP.
But what, you might ask, about the Internet? Goldman Sachs's estimate
includes Internet service providers, such as America Online, and the
technology and software used by online retailers, such as Amazon.com. It
does not, however, include transactions over the Internet. Should it?
E-business is tiny at present, but Forrester Research, an Internet
consultancy, estimates that this will increase to more than $1.5 trillion in
America by 2003. Internet bulls calculate that this would be equivalent to
about 13% of GDP. Yet it is misleading to take the total value of such goods
and services, whose production owes nothing to the Internet. The value added
of Internet sales-ie, its contribution to GDP-would be much less, probably
little more than 1% of GDP.
This is not to deny that the Internet is changing the way that many firms do
business-by, for example, enabling them to slim inventories-but, in the near
future, as a proportion of GDP, it is likely to remain small.
A Luddite's lament

If measuring the size of the technology sector is hard, calculating its
contribution to real economic growth is trickier still, because the prices
of IT goods and services (adjusted for quality) have fallen sharply relative
to the prices of other goods and services. For example, official figures
show that America's spending on IT has risen by 14% a year in nominal terms
since 1992, but by more than 40% a year in real terms. This figure is so
high partly because it is extremely sensitive to assumptions about the rate
at which the price and quality of IT is changing.
The Commerce Department calculates that the technology sector has
contributed 35% to overall economic growth over the past four years. But
because such figures are based on spending in real terms, the Goldman Sachs
study reckons they are misleading. In nominal terms, IT has accounted for a
more modest 10% of GDP growth in the past four years.
Another popularly quoted figure is that business spending on IT has risen
from 10% of firms' total capital-equipment investment in 1980 to 60% today.
But again, this is based on constant-dollar figures, and so it hugely
exaggerates the true increase. In terms of current dollars (and before the
latest revisions), Goldman Sachs calcuate that business investment in
computers accounts for 35% of total capital spending, not 60%. And even this
exaggerates the importance of IT, because much of the money goes to replace
equipment which becomes obsolete ever more quickly. The share of IT in
additional ""net"" investment is much smaller. Computers still account for
only 2% of America's total net capital stock.
For years economists have been seeking in vain for evidence that computers
have dramatically raised productivity. One explanation for the failure of
productivity to surge may be that official statistics are understating its
growth. Another is that much investment in IT has been wasted: hours spent
checking e-mail, surfing the Net or playing games reduce, not increase,
productivity. A third may simply be that IT is still too small to make a
difference: for the moment, appropriately enough, you can count the digital
economy on the fingers of one hand.
That is changing, and firms are learning. And note this: if you add in all
computer software and telecoms (on the widest definition), the share of IT
in the capital stock rises to 10-12%. As it happens, this is almost the same
as railways at the peak of America's railway age in the late 19th century.
Railways boosted productivity and changed the face of Victorian commerce.
Hype is hype-but the new economy may yet happen anyway.

I'm finalizing what we talked about yesterday and something struck me w.r.t. 
siting reform.

One of our key messages in California and nationally is that price spikes are 
due in no small part to outmoded, arcane siting rules and a shortage of power 
as a result.  Price spikes have led to wholesale and retail price caps, 
investigations, utility under-recovery, and threats of rolling back 
de-regulation, to name a few.  

Understanding that Dave raises some good points about why he's not thrilled 
about getting involved in more siting reform bills, could someone argue that 
from a corporate objective, getting a good siting reform bill passed this

 Longhorn Defense Stifles Buffs; Simms, Benson Spark Offensive Fireworks in
41-7 Romp

The Texas defense forced four turnovers and totoally shut down Colorado's
offense in the second half to lead the No. 9 Longhorns to a 41-7 victory over
No. 14 Colorado in Austin.
The offense also had a great day, with QB Chris Simms throwing for 234 yards
and three touchdowns and true freshman RB Cedric Benson getting 100 yards for
the second straight Saturday. He also scored two touchdowns and caught three
passes for 59 yards.
Benson had the day's biggest offensive play. It came with the Longhorns
leading 17-7 and facing second-and-20 at their own 5 just before the the
half. The Horns were going into a stout wind and Colorado was threatening to
get the ball back in great field position.
But Simms dropped back and, just before he was hit, flipped a shovel pass to
Benson, who caught it, put an awesome move on two Buff defenders and sped 40
yards to launch the Longhorns on an 85-yard scoring drive that broke the game
open.
The UT defense forced four Buffalo turnovers - three fumbles and a pass
interception - and held the potent Colorado offense to just two first downs
and 45 net offensive yards in the second half.
The three fumbles Colorado lost all came in the first half and cost the Buffs
a first-and-goal at the UT 4 with Texas ahead only 7-0, and set up short
Longhorn scoring drives for the field goal that made it 10-0 and the
touchdown that gave Texas a 17-7 lead.
Colorado's starting QB, Craig Ochs, did not play because of a concussion he
suffered in the victory over Texas A&M last week. His replacement, Bobby
Pesavento, is a better passer, but Ochs is a much better runner and his
absence caused the Buffaloes to change their offensive strategy to include
more passing and less double tight end power running. The Longhorn defense
also had something to do with that.
Here, briefly, is how the game went
First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred. Colorado took the ball and the Longhorn
defense stuffed the Buffs' power running game and forced a quick punt.
Starting at their own 40 after a short punt into the stiff wind, the Horns
scored quickly. Benson ran for 5, then Simms hit TE Bo Scaife for 7. A wide
receiver reverse was beautifully blocked, allowing B. J. Johnson to gallop 35
yards to the Buffalo 13. Benson carried three times for a first down at the
3, then Simms, after a fake to Benson going right, rolled left and hit WR Roy
Williams for the TD. Dusty Mangum's kick gave UT a 7-0 lead with 9:09 left.
On the first play after the kickoff Pesavento hit two big passes to the UT
21. Then he threw into a crowd at the Longhorn 10, but WR Derek McCoy
wrestled it away from three Horns and bulled to the four before fumbling.
Freshman LB Derrick Johnson recovered for Texas. The Horns couldn't move and
a short punt gave the Buffs the ball at their own 48. Colorado went to its
power running game and rolled to a first down at the UT 15 before the
Longhorn defense stiffened and forced a 29-yard field goal try that was wide.
CU led in first downs, 6-4, and in total offense, 126-82, but the Longhorns
led, 7-0, because they scored on their only foray deep into Buff territory,
while the Buffaloes'  fumble at the 4 and missed chip-shot FG killed both
their scoring chances.
Second Quarter
DE Kalen Thornton forced a fumble that was recovered by UT CB Roderick Babers
at the CU 21. The Horns drove to the 4 before Mangum kicked a 21-yard field
goal for a 10-0 lead with 11:47 left. UT's kickoff into the wind went out of
bounds, giving Colorado good field position at the 35 and the Buffs got their
running game going and swept in for the TD in just seven plays to cut the
lead to 10-7 with 8:32 left. UT drove into Buff territory, but Simms was
sacked to kill the threat. The third Colorado fumble of the half set the
Horns up at the Buff 35 and they capitalized, but they they had to score two
TDs to get credit for one. First, Simms hit Williams in the end zone and
Williams got a foot down in bounds, but the official waved it off. Benson got
the TD on a 12-yard run and Mangum's kick gave UT a 17-7 lead with 3:22 left.
A quick defensive stop gave the Horns another possession at their 15 with
2:08 left. Simms was sacked at the 5 on the first play, but Benson took a
shovel pass, juked two defenders off their feet at about the 10 and scampered
40 yards down the sideline. Simms passed to WR B. J. Johnson for 22 and to
Williams for 29 before Benson scored from the 4 with 1:10 left for a 24-7
lead. Texas led in first downs, 8-4, and in total offense, 144-118 in the
quarter.
Third Quarter
Texas couldn't move into the wind and had to punt. Colorado drove to the
Texas 32 and went for it on a fourth-and-2, but the Longhorn defense held
Brown to a 1-yard gain to end that drive. The Longhorn offense then drove 69
yards in 7 plays for another TD, with the payoff coming on a 24-yard pass
from Simms to WR Sloan Thomas. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 31-7 lead with 6:47
left. The UT defense stifled Colorado's next effort and Nathan Vasher ran the
Buffalo punt back 44 yards to the CU 18, setting up a 34-yard Mangum FG for a
34-7 lead with 3:53 left. Texas led in first downs, 7-2, and in total
offense, 101-35, in the quarter.
Fourth Quarter
Simms found Thomas all alone in the end zone  for 29 yards and the game's f
inal score on the Horns' first possession in the quarter. Major Applewhite
and Chance Mock took over at QB after that. The Longhorn defense did not
allow Colorado a single first down in the period and the Buffs had only 10
plays for 10 net yards.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday studying the films of the Longhorns 41-7 victory
over Colorado Saturday ""proved what we felt all along - our guys played
really well and really hard all day.""
He also said Colorado ""is a much better team than yesterday's score would
indicate. That was just a game that got out of hand because of turnovers.""
He said he was very pleased with the shovel passes, wide receiver reverses
and other misdirection plays the Horns used very successfully Saturday.
""If you are moving the ball, they usually work,"" he said. ""We've talked about
needing a little more misdirection. All of them are things we need to run
because it makes our regular plays work better.""
He had said last week wanted to ""use more traps, run more gaps and counter
gaps,"" saying it slowed defensive pursuit and created more doubt in the minds
of defenders.
After using a lot of them against the Buffaloes, he said they will remain a
part of the UT offense.
Colorado came into the game on a five-game winning streak and with a powerful
running game that ranked No. 13 nationally at 224.7 yards a game and a strong
rushing defense that was No. 15 nationally, allowing only 91.8 yards.
That had allowed the Buffs to dominate time of possession against their foes.
They were averaging about 36 minutes a game, compared to about 24 minutes for
their opponents.
But Texas dominated the time of possession, 33:33 to 26:27, held the
Buffaloes to 124 net rushing yards, 100 yards below their average, and rushed
on the Buff defenders for 161 yards, about 70 more than they had been
allowing.
Brown said the Longhorn defense did an outstanding job against the CU power
runners, and he said the Texas' offense was successful because it was able to
""stay two dimensional.""
But he said the early UT lead, helped along by the Colorado turnovers,
""forced them to try to play catch-up, and playing catch-up is not their game.""
""I think Colorado is really good,"" he said. ""We've played so well at home,
and our crowd gives us a big advantage at home. I think Colorado will win a
bunch more football games this year.""
Longhorn true freshman RB Cedric Benson picked up 100 yards rushing on 23
carries and scored two touchdowns in his second start.
It marked the first time all season a running back has hit the Colorado
defense for 100 yards.
""That's a credit to our balance, our offensive line and to Cedric,"" Brown
said. ""He's a fine running back who has great vision and who almost always
falls forward. He's getting better every week.""
Brown said he and his assistant coaches talk constantly to their players
about the need to show up ready to play every week, and he also said it's way
too early to worry about the BCS bowl situation ""because there are a lot of
football games still to be played before that comes into play.""
""We talked to our team after Florida lost to Auburn about how you can't
control anything except what you do. Anybody can beat anybody.""{
""Our guys understand the only thing they can do is be the best football team
they can be and be ready to play Missouri this Saturday. What we've got to do
is try to win four more football games and see where that takes us.""

Longhorn Notes, Quotes . .
They say football is a game of inches and UT QB Chris Simms will buy into
that, particularly after executiing the shovel pass to freshman RB Cedric
Benson just before the half that went for 40 yards and helped break the game
open.
""I was nervous dropping back,"" Simms said. ""I was in the end zone and saw the
defensive  end coming, and I didn't know if our tackle got a good piece of
him, and I'm thinking, 'Gosh, I have to get it out.' Cedric's still turning
around, and I kind of threw it just as I was about to get hit and hoped he
could catch it.""
""Cedric just got turned around and he caught it and then made an unbelievable
move down the sideline.""
As for Benson, he says college football is a little more complicated than he
thought it would be.
""In high school, it was basically run left, run right,"" he said. ""Here, I'm
learning how to block, how to fake better and how to run better routes.""
Simms said Benson ""is going to be great. He runs so hard on every play, and
the thing I like about him is every time I drop back to pass and he protects
for me, he turns around after his block and goes, 'Did I do okay?' ""
""I say, 'I didn't get hit, did I?' You did okay.""","Jerry Scarbrough's Simms QB Chris Simms RB Cedric Benson Benson QB Craig Ochs Bobby

344,"Kevin, I am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the 
increased MW's given well known industry issues with the 501F technology.  
Further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in 
any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower 
than 90 degrees at site.  Likely the buyer will run any spread option value 
or multiple value based on 90 degree output.

I may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue 
rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the MW's at any time 
but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse.  Given that 
the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really 
get.  Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of 
Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed 
for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer.

The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost 
savings to fund their fee ($9.0M) rather than further increase to the capital 
cost of the facilities.  As well, given current accounting language, any fee 
we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized 
so I would like to find ways for this to be self financing.

My knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and 
adjust tactics with EECC as necessary.

Statistics Changes 

Statistics for our Fantasy Football games are provided by the same service that keeps official stats for the NFL, and your league is scored according to these official stats. Occasionally we receive changes to the stats we initially post after the games on Sunday or Monday nights. This happens when a stat was incorrectly reported during a game. Please note that you will rarely, if ever, see these changes reflected in published box scores, whether on-line or in print. However, we include all stat changes that we receive by Tuesday at midnight ET each week. 

  _____  

In the Trenches 

Check out our In the Trenches column every Wednesday for a look at all the news coming out of the recent weekend's games. We'll cover injuries, roster moves, depth chart changes and more. Check the Fantasy News area - click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar - for In the Trenches, and make sure your Fantasy facts are up-to-date. Check the Fantasy News area throughout the week for more news and advice from the experts.

yet received third party transport rates, so if you know of any, please let 
me know.  Also, I have zeroed out some volumes on some tickets for June, so 
your schedulers will have to update volumes as they know them.  Rule of thumb 
was that if I had to add a month, I refreshed the rate but left volume at 
zero.  If the months were already on the ticket, then I refreshed the rate 
and left the volume as is.

I would advise that your schedulers check volumes on all pipes to ensure 
they're reflected in Position Manager correctly.  Please let me know if you

need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in 
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer

400,"Steve, I talked to Cindy Burnette about SIT Penalties in February on Monday, 
3/13/2000. Unfortunately Joann and I thought the SIT withdrawal Penalty was 
lifted on 2/3/2000 and reinstated on 2/17/2000. We did not realize that TCO 
lifted the penalty for only one day on 2/3/2000 and reinstated it on 
2/4/2000. TCO lifted it again on 2/15/2000 and reinstated it on 2/17/2000. 
Joann and I missed the period from 2/4/2000 to 2/14/2000.

In early February, Cindy talked to Joann and I about matching the burns to 
the best reading around noon of the gas day that just ended. Because TCO 
allows it shippers to  use SIT, our goal is try to match the burn to about 
500 dkt difference. There are some days we will go a little longer and some 
days we will go a little shorter. Our February 2000 monthly goal was to hit 
close to zero. I'm attaching a spreadsheet that shows Enron's net SIT for 
February was +288. Joann and I also realize that when SIT withdrawal is not 
allowed, that we need to send extra gas to the burn and then back off the gas 
once the actuals are received. 

The attached spreadsheet shows that on days 2/4/2000 to 2/6/2000 that Enron 
had 17,753 Broadrun gas going into Enron's IPP pool. Each day the SIT 
withdrawal was less than 500 dkt. On day 2/9/2000, we did adjust the actuals 
to meet the burn and Joann sent the print screens to Cindy on 3/10/2000 for 
proof to waive the penalties. On gas days 2/11/2000 to 2/14/2000, we were 
short less than 500 dkt and we had 5684 broadrun gas going to the pool. On 
2/18, we did adjust the actuals to meet the burn and sent the screen prints 
to Judy on 3/6/2000 for proof to waive the penalties for that day.

Joann and I are very competent and experienced schedulers and were not trying 
to game TCO's system by abusing the SIT withdrawals. We just didn't realize 
that TCO had reinstated the penalties for SIT withdrawal for 2/4/2000 to 
2/14/2000. The way TCO posts on the bulletin board, it is not always clear to 
the shippers when penalties situations are lifted and reinstated.

My other concern was how this penalty was communicated to us. Julie called me 
on 3/6/2000, and said that Judy wanted Julie to send to me the 8 series 
report. I told Julie I had no idea what she was talking about, but go ahead 
and send the report. When I received the report, it was the report we had 
used for overrun charges. We did not occur overrun changes, so I was not 
concerned with the report. Then Cindy called me about an hour later on 
3/6/2000 to tell me we had Hopewell penalties. I told Cindy I didn't 
understand what penalties we had incurred, since there were no overrun 
charges. She said we had SIT withdrawal penalties. Joann and I looked at days 
1, 2, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We faxed over the proof to TCO for day 18, that 
we had matched the burns to the readings available at noon that day. Joann 
specifically asked Judy if this was the only penalty we had, and Judy was not 
100 % sure but thought so. 

There were no further conversations between TCO Team 3 and Enron about the 
SIT withdrawal penalties, until Cindy called Joann on 3/10 around 4:30 pm to 
tell Joann we had incurred several days of penalties. Joann asked Cindy which 
days, since we had already fixed the days we knew about SIT withdrawal 
penalties. Cindy told Joann about days 4,5,6,9,11,12,13, and 14. Joann faxed 
the proof for day 2/9/2000. Joann asked Cindy if she could do the retro's for 
the other days because we had plenty of Broadrun gas going to our pool. Cindy 
told Joann that she would have to run it past Steve, to waive the other days 
penalties.

TCO's philosophy has been vary accommodating to its shippers in the past. 
Judy had always told Joann and I, if CES/Enron made a good faith effort to 
keep SIT to a minimum, the penalties will not be charged. Enron feels it made 
a good faith effort to minimize SIT withdrawals in February 2000, and would 
like the SIT withdrawal penalties to be waived.

In addition, Enron has a win/win request for our Customer ServiceTeam. TCO's 
penalty philosophy appears to be changing and will not be as accommodating as 
it was in the past. Enron would like our Customer Service Team's assistance 
during the month to identify potential penalty situations. This will 
alleviate disagreements between TCO and Enron at the end of the month.

Before I send the this to Jeanne Adkins and Tom Brasselle, I'm running this 
past y'all. 

Thanks for your assistance and understanding Enron's point of view.

Hello All-

Attached above are the cover letter and proposed tariff sheets filed by Texas Eastern yesterday for a June 1 effective date.  The rate changes reflect under recoveries in their ASA account which tracks their cash-out mechanism and increased cost of system fuel.  The underrecovery in the ASA account has increased from $22,000 to over $22,000,000 over the period September 1--March 31.  Texas Eastern claims that this is largely a result of the gaming of their currently monthly cash-out (which will likely be changed to weekly in their 637 proceeding).  As a result, Texas Eastern is seeking a waiver of the annual filing period in order to begin collecting the underrecovery through a surcharge that would amount to as much as $.0354 from ELA-M3.  Texas Eastern proposes to begin recovery in June so as to extend the recovery period from 12 months (Dec-Nov) to 18 months (Jun-Nov), which will lower the level of the surcharge.

We'll review the filing to see if there are any grounds for protest / comment.  These types of dollars are usually ""rubber-stamped"" by FERC for pass-through but the filing to change the recovery time period may give us some grounds to protest the recovery.

 The full filing can be found at :  http://infopost.link.duke-energy.com/infopost/default.asp?pipe=TE 

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.

We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

415,"We have good news for participants of the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  Last Friday, the creditors' committee and our board of directors approved our proposal to reinstate the company match.  We can enact the match in the normal course of business without bankruptcy court approval.

Beginning July 1, 2002, Enron will again match employee pre-tax contributions to the Plan.  The match will be credited to active participants' eligible contributions on their first paycheck in July.

In addition, from July 1 through December 31, 2002, Enron will double the rate of the company match that was in effect prior to the suspension, with a maximum match on employee pretax contributions of 6 percent of base salary.  In January 2003, the rate of the company match will return to the level in effect prior to the suspension.

Beyond reinstating the match, Enron is also instituting the following enhancements to the Savings Plan:
?	The company match will follow participants' investment elections.  In other words, the company match will be allocated to the same funds in which the participant has elected to invest.
?	Currently, participants are able to contribute one to 15 percent of their base salaries to the Savings Plan.  After July 1, participants will be able to increase their contribution up to a maximum of 50 percent of their base salary.  The 2002 federal limit for pre-tax contributions to the Savings Plan is $11,000.
?	Participants who are age 50 or older in 2002 will be able to contribute up to $12,000 of pre-tax income to the Savings Plan in 2002.  This additional $1,000 is not eligible for company-matched contributions.

Active Enron employees who are not currently participating in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan have until 3:00 p.m. CST on Thursday, June 27, 2002 to enroll in the Plan for their first July payroll contribution to be matched.  The same deadline applies to active participants in the Plan who may wish to increase their Savings Plan contribution rate in time for the first July payroll.  (For now, participants can only increase their contribution rate to the current maximum of 15 percent of base salary.  After July 1, participants will be able to increase their contribution rate to the new maximum of 50 percent.)

To enroll in the Savings Plan or make a change to your current contributions, please log on to <http://resources.hewitt.com/enron>, or call the Benefit Service Center at 1-800-332-7979, option 3.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). ","David Oxley

49 point margin is unacceptable.  I was at the game and it was as if the 
Texas coaches got a bunch of guys from the frat houses this week and put 
together a game plan on Saturday morning before kickoff.  They were out of 
position, slow, unmotivated, and flat out not prepared to play.  I like Brown 
and actually think he is a good fit, but at some point you actually have to 
coach.  I lay this all at his feet.  Obviously the coordinators bear some 
major responsibility as well.  I really don't know what to expect for the 
remainder of the season.  They obviously are not as bad as they showed on 
Saturday.  But the fact remains that they are capable of playing that poorly 
on any Saturday, and I really did not think that with this defense they could 
be humiliated.  I was very wrong.  Something has to change.  The fact is they 
are 3-5 in the last 8 games.  And were favored in all but one.  Lack of 
talent is no longer an excuse.  I think the entire remainder of the season 
hinges on this Saturday.  If they play as poorly as they have all season 
(they have beaten 3 terrible teams, and lost to a bad one) against Colorado, 
they will lose and I could see them finishing at 6-5 and even 5-6 not out of 
the question.  For this reason, I think that this could be the biggest game 
of Brown's tenure at UT.  What do you think?","Brown

479,"	As you might recall, York filed two summonses against Enron and Eric Holzer in two separate lawsuits' connected with the parties' dealings in the paper market. The two summonses (as allowed by Pennsylvania law) lacked any information about York's claims against Enron or Mr. Holzer. The Enron defendants removed their suits to federal court. Dechert is the Enron defendants' outside counsel.  
	We have finally received York's complaint detailing its claims against Enron and Mr. Holzer.  In a nutshell, York claims that Enron hired Holzer away from York in an effort to steal York's customer base and then, contrary to the parties' agreement and custom in the industry, proceeded to steal customers from York. Specifically, York claims that the only reason it let Holzer out of his non-compete agreement with York is because both Holzer and Enron promised: that they would honor the allegedly established practice in the paper industry preventing competitors from usurping each other's client relationships by selling paper directly to each other's clients, and that York would get new business from Enron. It is York's position that Holzer took confidential and proprietary information from York when he left that company, gave this information to Enron and that Enron and Holzer used this information to wrongfully steal York's customers. 
	York has alleged causes of action against Enron and Holzer for:
	1.	Theft of trade secrets,
	2.	Breach of contract (several counts),
	3.	Tortuous interference with contractual relations,
	4.	Tortuous interference with prospective contractual relations,
	5.	Fraudulent inducement,
	6.	Unfair competition, and 
	7.	Civil conspiracy.
	My initial impression is that York should be more worried about having agreements with its competitors preventing business solicitation then Enron should be worried about a predatory pricing claim; however, I don't know enough about the facts to have a firm view of the case. We are in the process of getting more information about these claims and I'll update you again after we have talked to our folks about this.  In the meantime, please call with any questions or comments. ",Eric Holzer Holzer,,York Enron Dechert Holzer

Rod and Kathy,

	Hello to all! How are you guys doing? Great I hope.

	It's been awhile since I last heard from you guys so I
	thought I would drop a short message to you. We are all
	doing pretty well. Lauren has completed her college search
	and has been accepted at Santa Clara University, UC San Diego,
	Univ. of San Diego, Pepperdine and Univ. of Puget Sound. I think
	she'll end up at Puget Sound, she felt most comfortable there.
	She has to decide by May 1st.
	Lauren is in a musical at school this next few weeks. It's called
	the ""Wiz"". She is singing and dancing, she has a few different
	extra rolls. She is having great fun with it.

	I do not remember any of this when we were thinking of college.
	Things have changed just alittle I think.

	Janet is feeling ok, still having alittle stomach trouble. The
	only thing the Dr's. can think that might be causing this is her
	braces on her teeth. I think that is pretty remote. We'll see
	soon next month when her braces come off. I am doing pretty well
	myself, work has been keeping me busy and I've spent a few extra
	hours out in the yard. I hope to complete the landscaping and
	sprinklers some time this year. (Ha ha!)

	How are KC and Cory doing? School still going ok for them both?

	Well your three (3) homes are probably keeping kathy pretty
	busy these days. It nice that they are all fairly close to
	Houston so you can get away to them as often as you would
	like.

	We went up to Seattle and Tacoma last week to vist Puget Sound,
	I really like the area alot. I never new that Seattle was such a
shopper's paradise! The girls shopped for about two days straight.
	Every store you can think of was in a very small section of
	town. A really fun place to visit.

	I just looked at the time and realized I need to get to work
	this morning. Say hello to all for us and write if you have a
	chance. Be good and happy.

	Love,

	Dave, Janet and Lauren..................

Analyst/Associate Program

The most essential determinant of Enron's continued growth is our ability to attract and develop new talent.  The analyst/associate program has been the biggest contributor to our success in this area.  Charlene Jackson, currently leading our analyst/associate program, has taken a commercial position in EES' account management organization.  We thank Charlene for her hard work and many contributions to the program.  Going forward, this program will be administered by a committee chaired by John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe.  The members of this committee are listed below.  Billy Lemmons, currently Vice President of Enron Global Markets, will lead the day-to-day operations of the program. Billy joined Enron in 1992, and has served in a variety of commercial capacities across the company and has been an active participant in the Associate /Analyst program.  Please join us in congratulating Billy on his new responsibilities.

495,"Greetings:

I am attaching my Excel spreadsheet that takes you through the various iterations of the capital expenses and cost-of-service calculations for the Elba Island LNG Terminal.  I have included certain ""estimate"" information that reflects my attempt to derive cost-of-service information to augment what Southern LNG has provided.

Rod Hayslett has kindly agreed to develop the proper algorithm to more accurately calculate this information and to work with Eric Groves on integrating this as a module in Eric's LNG economic evaluation model for the Atlantic Basin.  I believe we will need this in order to analyze the proposals that we expect to receive from El Paso Merchant Energy this week.

I would also like James McMillan to take a look at the commodity charges and electric power rates for the nitrogen injection, air injection and gas liquids stripping cases, as well as at the fixed O&M costs.  Some updating of the ""estimate"" information is likely needed.

I will send copies of the relevant background information received from Southern LNG to each of you.  In addition, I will be sending out a general memo to a wider audience with the attached spreadsheet.

Regards.
Les Webber

Rod,

Here is an update on where we are at on reorganizing, in order to avoid filling the Director's position vacated by Larry Fenstad.   I met with all the OSS Directors and gave them the following attached guidelines and an opportunity to redesign the organzation, without filling back Larry's position.   The org charts below represent the organization that we have agreed to pursue.

I have met with Laura and Brian to review the organization and to have compensation review.   Gary Smith has reviewed the proposal and given his approval.   

While we will encounter a couple of moves, in order to implement this, we will keep the staffing levels whole and reduce by one (1) directors position, and not increase our current estimate.   The real benefits to this organization are:

It provides better supervision and alignment with the field operations.
It will provide for better training opportunities for future management positions.
It will better align our consolidation efforts.
It will off-load some daily supervisory responsibilities from David, Elaine and Barney.
It will free up some time for David, Elaine and Barney to better oversee and improve the quality of the financial data.

When we get some of the following issues resolved and working smoothly, I feel we will be able to support and possibly downsize from our current staffing levels:

SAP
ADAYTUM
DATA WAREHOUSE
iBUYIT
iPayit
SAP Timekeeping
Conversion of MCS/MP2 to MP5
Codes & Compliance - fully implemented for all Business Units
Ex-EOTT Administrative personnel trained
Training for our personnel on the fully functional systems



  

I met with Larry this morning and went over transitional issues.   He will be working with HR to get his severance papers in order.  We are looking at an effective date of September 01, 2001.

Thank you for the introduction.

For my part I am responsible for finance & Regulation at Wessex

Our work over the next month is to set out the heads of terms of contracts
between the regulated asset company and the new unregulated service company.

Attached is a note we have prepared setting out payment principles.  You
will see initial thoughts on issues such as who has what risk.

In considering this it may be useful to note some important points about the
UK Water industry, viz
1    The Licence holder (asset company) retains ultimate responsibility -
and criminal liability - for service delivery
2    The UK industry is very political and hence loose contracts are
necessary to deal with unexpected events.
3    The regulatory reporting requirements are very detailed & will require
annual information on the costs of both the Licence holder & (probably) the
service company

On the timing of your vist I am trying to arrange a tour of Wessex & its
assets for Thursday and or Friday next week.  You can also discuss some of
the issues on the contracts with the in house team.  unfortunatly I have
meeting with the regulator on the Thursday & am tied up much of Friday - but
it is probably better for you to spend time with people doing the  real work
rather than me.

Monday can be used for our meeting with the lawyers.  This will probably be
later in the day and go on into the evening.

I will get you a more detailed itinerary soon.

with best regards

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

540,"Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: ""Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue.""
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.",Copp swain Franz Houston Ballet William atre Imp Karen Dacko Frederic Franklin Peter Farmer Anne Heaton Desmond Heeley Carl Cunningham,,"AZURIX ENRON Corporate Sponsors Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre

But I think he's got alot of other stuff going on in his life now with job and friends and feels that he can't be committed to a relationship and knows he's not going to make the effort.  I don't know if that will change anytime soon or not.  I'm assuming it won't, but hoping it will.  Anyway, I'm just super-depressed now and my birthday is tomorrow!  This will not be a birthday to remember.  :(  I really wasn't ready for our relationship to end, and didn't think it was about to, really.  So, I have to deal with the shock as well as the sadness.

I've updated the transmission rates table for May - here is the location:

M:\Electric\East Volume Mgmt\Transmission\Transmission Rates

If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me 
know and I can put a copy of it whereever.

Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...

First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the 
counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric 
Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has 
not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49

Please pass this along to the rest of the group, if any of you have any 
questions or suggestions - don't hesitate to call.

  Some people are only alive because
  it is illegal to shoot them

  I used to have a handle on life, but it broke.

  WANTED: Meaningful overnight relationship.

  You're just jealous because the voices
  only talk to ME.

  BEER: It's not just for breakfast anymore.

  So you're a feminist...Isn't that cute.

  I need someone real bad...
  Are you real bad?

  BEAUTY is in the eye of the beer holder.

  All men are idiots...
  and I married their king.

  The more you complain,
  the longer God makes you live.

  I(nternal) R(evenue) S(ervice):
  We've got what it takes
  to take what you've got.

  Hard work has a future payoff.
  Laziness pays off now.

  Reality is a crutch for people
  who can't handle drugs.

  Out of my mind...Back in five minutes.

  As long as there are tests,
  there will be prayer in public schools.

  Hang up and drive.

  I said ""NO"" to drugs,
  but they didn't listen.

  Your kid may be an Honor Student,
  but YOU'RE still an idiot.

  Smile, it's the second best thing you can do with your lips.

  I took an IQ test and the results were negative.

  Where there's a will...I want to be in it.

  It's lonely at the top, but you eat better.

  Don't drink and drive...
  You might hit a bump and spill your drink.

  Consciousness: That annoying time between naps.

  Ever stop to think, and forget to start again?

  Always remember you're unique...
  Just like everyone else.

  HONK
  If You Want To See My Finger

  Who lit the fuse on your tampon?

  I don't have a license to kill.
  I have a learner's permit.

  I wasn't born a bitch.
  Men like you made me this way.

  Keep honking while I reload.

  Taxation WITH representation isn't so hot, either!

  Who were the testers for
  Preparations A through G?

  Madness takes its toll.
  Please have exact change.

  5 days a week my body is a temple.
    The other two, it's an amusement park.

  EARTH FIRST!
  We'll stripmine the other planets later.

  If you drink, don't park.
  Accidents cause people.

  If you can read this
  I can hit my brakes and sue you.

  Save the whales!
  Trade them for valuable prizes.

  Whitewater is over
  when the First Lady sings.

  Jack Kevorkian for White House physician.

  My wife keeps complaining I never listen to her
  ...or something like that.

  Sure you can trust the government!
  Just ask an Indian!

  Alcohol and calculus don't mix.
  Never drink and derive.

  If we are what we eat,
  I'm cheap, fast, and easy.

  Stop repeat offenders.
  Don't re-elect them!

have sad news to report.  My neighbor died this morning. You remember the 
little neighbor who got burned, and no one told her that her father had lung 
cancer, well he expired.  Please pray for the family.  I feel so sorry for 
his wife.  I know I never have good news, and if you ever get tired of me 
telling you bad news just let me know.  The devil is so busy, I have to ask 
for help to fight him.  I really appreciate your willing ear. My other 
neighbor went to the emergency room Monday and they will keep her until 
today. She 
thought she was having a heart attack.  We do not know what is wrong with her 
she will go for test on next Thursday.  Help me pray for these families.  You 
know I love you.  I will talk to you later.  Tell all the Saints I said 
hello.

	Many believe the potato chip was born in 1853 in a restaurant in Saratoga 
Springs, N.Y. when a picky customer complained about the thickness of his 
fried potatoes. When the potatoes were returned to wise guy cook, George Crum 
he sliced some potatoes as thinly as possible, fried them and sent them back 
to the customer. To his surprise the man loved them. For more, click here.

	The Long Hack Veil
	Jennifer visited a psychic of some local repute. 
	
	In a dark and hazy room, peering into a crystal ball, the mystic delivered 
grave news: 
	
	""There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just be blunt - prepare yourself to 
be a widow. Your husband will die a violent and horrible death this year."" 
	
	Visibly shaken, Jennifer stared at the woman's lined face, then at the single 
flickering candle, then down at her hands. She took a few deep breaths to 
compose herself. 
	
	She simply had to know. She met the fortune teller's gaze, steadied her 
voice, and asked: 
	
	""Will I be acquitted?""

Fact of the Day

 


Archie Comics fans will be happy to know that a ""real-life"" film version of 
""Josie and the Pussycats"" is in the works and is scheduled to hit theaters in 
2001. Aging Gen X'ers may remember the 1970s Hanna-Barbera ""Pussycat"" series, 
on which Cheryl Ladd of ""Charlie's Angels"" fame provided the singing voice 
for ditsy drummer Melody Valentine. For more, click here.

Joke of the Day

 


*** Accouting for Taste 

The accountant for the law firm of Dewey, Cheatham & Howe was retiring after 
working for the firm for seventeen years. Cheatham was interviewing 
applicants, and was disappointed, as only three had even bothered to send in 
a resume.  

After looking over the application of the first, an accountant with six years 
experience at Goldman Sachs, he called the first applicant in, and asked the 
woman what 2 plus 2 was.  

She answered, ""Four.""  

Cheatham said he would call her if she was selected.  

The second candidate was a CPA from Harvard, and at the end of the interview 
he was asked the same question, ""What is two and two?""  

The CPA replied, ""Four."" Cheatham told him that he would call the young man 
if he was selected.  

The third applicant was a recently-graduated philosophy. Cheatham figured 
that this wasn't going to go anywhere, but thought, ""What the hey? I've got 
nothing to lose.""  

He interviewed the young man quickly and asked, ""I know you don't have an 
accountancy background, but can you tell me what two plus two is?""  

To which the philosophy major replied, ""Can you tell me what would you want 
it to be?""  

And was hired on the spot.

As you requested, I spoke with Brad McSherry concerning the position, salary, 
and immediate supervisor. I asked Brad to provide a formal letter of offer 
and informed him that I needed it before the end of business Friday. 
Unfortunately, I have not received the letter thus far. Although the job was 
well defined, I felt that the administrative details of the position were not 
clearly laid out. For example, I specifically asked last week who my manager 
would be and was told that it would be you. However, I later found out (by 
chance) that this was not the case. Also, it was unclear whether I would be 
in the research group or in Enron communications. 
Although these two issues are not critical and under normal circumstances 
would be resolved, given previous confusion regarding my role and 
compensation with the research group, I feel less comfortable accepting the 
position. To be specific, there was an unnecessary struggle regarding my 
interview reimbursement and there were problems regarding my bonus. In 
general I feel that there has been a significant lack of communication and 
respect.
Therefore I feel that I am left with the decision not to make the move to 
Enron and feel that it would be in everyone's best interest not to pursue 
this any further. Thank you.

I change the storage model output to its total value versus the unit value 
before.
The total value refers to the total present value of the storage capacity at 
given
status (initial conditions).

The way I calculate the unit value is 

(Total PV - S*capacity taken)/total capacity

which could suffer some negative numbers since S, the spot price could be
very high.  The correct way is to define the S as the average injection gas 
price, but
 this would be troublesome to compute.

By switching to total PV, the delta can be interpreted as total commodity 
delta for the
hedge.  Actually, Duffie also suggested using the total PV as the output in 
his audit
review.

markets will likely be introducing some demand-response programs by June,
there is a clear need for continual evaluation of these nascent efforts to
transform the market. The conference provides an opportunity to learn from
different experiences.

This policy research meeting will focus on establishing a foundation for
understanding the key concepts and methods for demand response programs and
to provide an opportunity for participants to raise questions and recommend
directions for additional research and analysis.  Participants will come
from companies, government, and universities.  You can obtain more
information about the conference by checking under ""Meetings"" on our EMF

Please let me know if you plan on attending.  Also, if you would like to
make a brief 15-minute presentation, please let me know your topic and
describe it in a few sentences.  I will try to choose speakers that will
cover the full range of interests represented by this group.  Researchers
should focus on the implications of their analysis for designing demand
response programs rather than on the technical details of their
methodology.  I would also encourage practitioners to discuss their
experience in implementing demand response programs or in raising selected
issues.

I have revised my memo on Chris Hessler, my recommendation for the AA for Air 
slot at EPA, based on some recent developments.  If you have forwarded on to 
Ken Lay, please send this new updated version.

Because Gov. Whitman's credibility and clout in the White House has been 
damaged somewhat in the last week beacuse of the Bush announcement on CO2, 
her recommendation of Chris Hessler for this job may be taken less seriously.

We are hearing that C. Boyden Gray's choice -- Jeff Holmstead -- is becoming 
a more serious candidate for the job, based on his more conservative 
credentials.  Senator Inhofe's choice is no longer considered in the running 
at all.

My recommendation is still that we back Hessler.  We have nothing to lose:  
1)  we are supporting Whitman (which could help our initiatives at EPA).  2)  
we are supporting Hessler -- if he gets the job, we have a great relationship 
with the key EPA air person, if he doesn't, he's still the key Senate staffer 
on Clean Air and can help us tremendously.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
04/11/2001 

GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS SIGNS LANDMARK ENERGY CONSERVATION PACKAGE
APRIL 11, 2001
(Construction noise in background) Well, maybe they're building a power 
plant. Think of it that way.
My friends, for the last 10 years California failed to build a single major 
power plant. Because of that we're facing a power shortage. Rest assured, my 
administration is moving at warp speed to correct the situation. 
Since I've been Governor we have approved 12 new plants; 7 are under 
construction as I speak to you, which is a record; 4 will be on line this 
summer; 3 next summer. By the end of 2003 this problem will correct itself. 
But between now and then we need everyone to do their part to conserve -- so 
we can get through this summer without major disruptions.
The bills I'm going to sign today give incentives to consumers and businesses 
to do their part and reduce the energy consumption they would otherwise use 
by at least 10 percent. 
The centerpiece of these proposals are $500 million in incentives for 
consumers and businesses. Fifty percent rebates if you buy a new refrigerator 
or air conditioner. If you're a business, we'll pay for energy efficient 
lighting -- whether it's dimmers or occupancy sensor devices. We'll pay for 
the cost of the item; we'll pay for the cost of the installation. 
We have a series of proposals including $60 million to municipal power 
authorities like the Department of Water & Power, so they can augment their 
conservation programs. Because clearly, the cheapest megawatt this summer is 
the megawatt we don't have to buy. We need every consumer to do their part to 
help us through this difficult period.
As I said, this problem will correct itself over time -- but you cannot make 
up for 12 years of inaction overnight. Between now and 2003 we need everyone 
doing their part.
It is our hope that the combination of incentives in this legislation, which 
applies to the urban and agricultural areas, commercial and industrial, and 
residential, will save at least 2000 megawatts this summer.
The whole purpose of these bills is to achieve conservation this summer. The 
money runs out if it's not spent by next March. We want a big response this 
summer. And if people can't get it all done this summer, we want them 
prepared to conserve electricity by next summer.
There is also in this package $240 million for low-income people to 
weatherize their homes, making them more energy-efficient. So we have a range 
of incentives for consumers and businesses, and I'm counting on everyone to 
pull together as one state and do their part. 
With 34 million people, even though we're facing a power shortage, we are not 
powerless. We have the power to use less electricity, then the generators who 
are marking up the price by 800 percent want us to use. By using that power 
we will not only reduce our bills, but we will minimize the possibility of 
blackouts.
So I thank Californians for responding to my call. Already they're saving 8 
percent. I want them to get up to 10 percent so we can get through these 
difficult times, but help is on the way. By the end of 2003 we'll have more 
plants than we need. And to make electricity deregulation work, you must have 
more power than you need. 
We currently have a 20 percent deficit. By the end of 2003, early 2004 at the 
latest, those lines will cross and we'll have more power than we currently 
need. 
I intend to get that differential up to 15 percent. Most experts, including 
Alan Greenspan, say you need a 15 percent margin of capacity over demand. 
That forces the price down in the spot market and that gives the state 
leverage against the generators -- rather than generators leverage against 
the state.
I'm very pleased the Legislature responded as quickly as it did. This is a 
big day. The consumers and the business in this state now have financial 
tools to help them conserve power. If you're a consumer we'll pay 50 percent 
of the cost of an energy-saving device. If you're a business, because they 
use 70 percent of our power, we'll pay for the whole cost and install it 
ourselves. We've got one goal - which is to save at least 2000 megawatts this 
summer in this part of our energy conservation program.
Our overall goal, including my 20/20 program, which gives people a 20 percent 
rebate if they save 20 percent of the power they used last year is to save 
between 4 and 5000 megawatts this summer. These bills I'm signing today 
should get us at least 2000 megawatts.
Let me sign the bills and then call on the legislators who helped make this 
possible to add their comments. 
Introductions
They worked long and hard. This represents the most aggressive and the most 
expensive conservation program ever launched in America. It's designed to 
save megawatts this summer. Not five years from now; not seven years from 
now. This summer, and worst case, next summer. 
This is a crash program, all guns blazing. We are paying for conservation 
devices; we're installing them ourselves. We want to make sure that every 
building, every office building, every retail shop, every high-tech 
community, every agriculture concern, squeezes down the megawatts they use as 
much as is humanly possible - and still allows them to continue and make a 
profit. We're going to do with this measure.
Let me entertain any questions you might have.
Questions/Answers
Question: Governor Davis, can you talk about the way this is going to be 
promoted. How is word about this going to get out? I see there's a provision 
in it, but what are people going to begin to hear about how to use these 
incentives?
Governor: We have, as you know, a program run by the Consumer Affairs 
Department, which advertises ways in which people can conserve energy. 
They're going to reinforce the message that these incentives are here; 
they're available to consumers and businesses alike. And they're the most 
attractive incentives ever devised by a state in America.
We hope to encourage people to take advantage of this program. It's not going 
to last forever. It disappears next March. This is a one-time opportunity to 
do the right thing for yourself, and the right thing for your state. 
So basically, through television, through lots of literature that goes out 
from various departments... all the information will be on our web site. 
We'll work through various business organizations from Chambers to -- 
manufacturing groups, homeowner groups. We'll take advantage of every 
opportunity to get the word out.
Question: Is there now an enforcement element in case people maybe don't take 
the carrot, is there a stick?
Governor: We're going to actually contact, just start going down the list 
starting with the largest consumers of power in this state which tend to be 
big businesses and say: We've got a device, we want to install, when can we 
come in. So we're not waiting for them to call us. 
This is a race against time, and we have to fight back against these 
generators. And the best way to fight back is to use less of their power than 
they want us to. That's the best weapon we have. Conservation is the best 
weapon we have against price gouging and blackouts.
Question: Governor, regarding P.G.&E. and the bankruptcy, are you hopeful you 
can somehow you can reopen negotiations with them and come along?
Governor: First of all, I think Southern California Edison proved that if you 
stay at the table... If you're responsible... If you care about the customers 
you're serving - good things can happen. We intend to get a similar 
arrangement with Sempra. An extensive meeting is occurring as I speak to you. 
I hope that can be done within two weeks; it may be sooner.
Then we intend to inform the bankruptcy judge in San Francisco of how we 
we've negotiated settlements with two of the state's three utilities, in the 
hopes that he will order either an identical transaction, or something very 
similar to P.G.&E. 
Because P.G.&E. has chosen to go into bankruptcy, keep in mind its creditors 
did not force it. They chose to go into bankruptcy. That's the form through 
which we have to communicate. But I think if we can get two of the three 
utilities tied down to a similar arrangement, the bankruptcy referee will be 
persuaded by that, and it will lend great weight to that. 
Question: Governor, a lot was said about profiteers around the state today. 
Do you have a comment on the L.A. Times decoding the CAL ISO Study that 
showed the DWP was among the profiteers last year; it was number eight on a 
list of ten?
Governor: First of all, it gives me an opportunity to thank David Freeman for 
helping us secure power on a long term basis. He had no leverage. He began 
the process February 1st. I can't imagine a more difficult assignment. He did 
a great job.
The Department of Water & Power sold us power, which is more than I can say 
for generators. Yes, they had a mark-up, but we desperately needed power. 
They came through. They're part of this state. They realized their obligation 
to serve the entire state. Once they've met their constituents' need, they've 
shared additional power with us.
I don't know how much money we currently owe the Department of Water & Power, 
but it's certainly over $100 billion. So they have provided us power when we 
needed it. I don't think they've excessively priced it, particularly when you 
compare them against some of the out-of-state generators. And they've been 
patient with us, knowing that they would eventually get their money back. And 
they will get their money back.
So I'm not going to join the chorus of critics. Without the Department of 
Water & Power, we would have had more blackouts than we had. 
I told them that if my plan doesn't work, my fallback plan is for the 
Department of Water & Power to ",GRAY DAVIS Alan Greenspan Davis David Freeman,"$500 million $60 million $240 million 8

For Crucial California Trip, Bush Calibrates How Best to Handle State's 
Energy Crisis
By DAVID E. SANGER

05/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 12, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

LOS ANGELES, May 28 -- Days after he suffered the biggest political setback 
of his four-month-old presidency and then won the tax cut that he staked his 
campaign upon, President Bush traveled tonight to California, carefully 
calibrating how to deal with the state's energy crisis. 
After Memorial Day celebrations in Washington and Mesa, Ariz., Mr. Bush began 
his first visit as president to the most populous state, which he lost by 
roughly 12 percentage points in November's election. The visit seems likely 
to showcase the clash between two very different energy strategies and 
political strategies.
Mr. Bush will meet briefly on Tuesday with Gov. Gray Davis, who will insist, 
as he did again today, that the federal government impose price caps on 
wholesale electric power. 
The White House says Mr. Bush will refuse, again. He will argue that such 
caps would only discourage increased production of electric power. ''We think 
that's a mistake,'' Vice President Dick Cheney said on Friday, talking about 
why he rejected those options when he prepared the energy policy the 
administration made public 10 days ago. 
But Mr. Bush knows that how he handles the California energy crisis could 
prove critical to his political fortunes, especially now that his party's 
loss of control in the Senate seems bound to slow or derail passage of major 
elements of his energy plan. 
Moreover, the president can no longer argue that the best cure for high 
energy prices is a tax cut, because that is now legislative history. As one 
of his aides said this weekend, after Congress approved the $1.35 trillion 
tax cut that will be phased in over the next 10 years, ''we will have to turn 
now to the other arguments.'' 
Most of those arguments involve urging the rest of the country not to follow 
California in a partial deregulation of the market, with disastrous results. 
Repeatedly Mr. Bush has chastised California's politicians, and by 
implication Mr. Davis himself, for ignoring politically unpalatable choices 
to avert the state's power-generating crisis. Ten days ago, standing in front 
of a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania, Mr. Bush used the state as Exhibit 
A for his argument about what happens when population rises, when 
over-regulation freezes the construction of new power plants and the 
stringing of new transmission lines, and when politicians fail to plan for 
the long term. 
''The problems in California shows that you cannot conserve your way to 
energy independence,'' Mr. Bush said then. 
At the same time, his aides were pointing to polls showing Mr. Davis's 
approval ratings plunging. They did not mention that Mr. Bush's ratings in 
the state were hardly any better. A series of recent polls show that roughly 
two-thirds of Californians believe Mr. Bush should be doing far more to help 
the state, though it is unclear exactly what kind of help they have in mind. 
So Mr. Bush's aides have been struggling for days to choreograph the two-day 
visit here, trying to find ways to differ with Mr. Davis without seeming 
callous about the problem or in conflict with the state. 
The betting is that Mr. Bush will focus on long-term solutions, in contrast 
to Mr. Davis's call for the quicker fix of price caps. 
The effort started today. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham issued an order of 
chiefly symbolic importance, saying his department would move quickly to 
determine whether investors were interested in financing and co-owning a new 
transmission line that could bring more power to the state. 
''The level of interest will be a factor in the decision to build the line 
later this year,'' the Energy Department said. It said that it would proceed 
with studies of how the land could be acquired, by eminent domain if 
necessary, and that it would speed ahead with environmental reviews. 
But Mr. Abraham left wide open the question of whether Washington would go 
ahead with the project even if no private financing was available. 
''The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a 
long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system,'' Mr. 
Abraham said. ''California's electricity problems developed over a period of 
years and cannot be solved overnight. However, we can move now on actions 
that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after 
year.'' 
The statement was clearly intended as a prelude to the meeting with Mr. 
Davis, which will be closed to the press. So will a meeting with energy 
entrepreneurs. (Mr. Bush passed on Mr. Davis's suggestion of a forum with 
small-business owners and residents who have seen the lights go out.) 
Few expect Mr. Bush or Mr. Davis to change his mind about energy caps after 
their meeting. 
But for Mr. Bush it will not all be tough love. On Tuesday morning Mr. Bush 
is scheduled to travel to Camp Pendleton to repeat his call for the military 
and other federal users of power in California to flip off their switches 
whenever possible. But given his own comments, and Mr. Cheney's, about the 
limited utility of conservation, that order could strike some Californians as 
a little hollow. 
Later he will give a trade speech in Los Angeles, underscoring the message 
that if California hopes to remain the world's greatest exporter of high 
technology -- if it were a nation, California would be the world's 
sixth-largest economy -- it must find new ways to produce and deliver 
electricity. 
Already, leading Silicon Valley companies are threatening to build their 
next-generation chip fabrication plants elsewhere, probably in Texas, which 
has a surplus of generating capacity, a move that would further undermine Mr. 
Davis's stewardship. 
In fact, Mr. Bush's Texas roots will never be far from the political 
battlefield here. Mr. Davis has accused Texas energy companies of 
profiteering at California's expense. To press the case, he has hired two 
political operatives from the Clinton White House, Marc D. Fabiani and Chris 
Lehane, who are being paid tens of thousands of dollars a month to make the 
case for price caps. 
California's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, also a Democrat, suggested to 
The Wall Street Journal last week that some time in jail would be the best 
way to deal with one of Mr. Bush's biggest supporters -- Kenneth Lay, who 
heads the Enron Corporation and has sought to influence the selection of 
members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
The comments may have been partly facetious, but they were not interpreted 
that way here.

In Billing Spat, Enron Project Rejects Payment By Indian State
By Jesse Pesta
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

05/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -- In an unusual twist in their quarrel over unpaid bills, Enron 
Corp.'s Indian power project, Dabhol Power Corp., has rejected a check valued 
at $29.1 million from its only customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board, to make a legal point. 
Dabhol also delivered a sharply worded four-page letter to the MSEB, 
responding to the electricity board's decision last week to rescind its 
power-purchasing contract based on a claim that Dabhol misrepresented its 
""ramp-up"" speed -- the time the plant takes to go from a cold start to full 
power. ""We deny that DPC have practiced any misrepresentation,"" Dabhol's 
letter says. ""Furthermore, we do not think that the MSEB entertains any 
honest belief"" in its own allegation, it says.
It's the latest in a series of rancorous exchanges as both sides try to gain 
an edge in a fight over Dabhol's power tariffs. The $3 billion power plant is 
the largest foreign investment in India, and the dispute is closely watched 
as an indicator of India's hospitality to investors from abroad. India needs 
electricity badly, but many of its state electricity boards are cash-strapped 
due to widespread power theft and lax metering. The Dabhol dispute started 
about six months ago, when the MSEB defaulted on monthly bills totaling $48 
million. 
Dabhol's critics claim its tariffs are unreasonably high, which Dabhol 
denies. Among other things, Dabhol says MSEB draws only about 15% of the 
plant's capacity, down from an average 60% or so before the dispute; the 
reduced usage boosts the per-unit price because the pricing formula includes 
some capital costs. 
In its letter, Dabhol says it rejected the 1.369-billion-rupee check because 
it came with a note saying it was submitted ""under protest,"" a reference to 
the MSEB's decision last week to rescind the contract. ""The MSEB cannot have 
it both ways,"" says the letter, signed by Enron executive K. Wade Cline. 
Either it's rescinding the contract, or ""it is affirming the validity of the 
[contract]"" by making payments. 
However, MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal said that after the check was rejected, 
the MSEB went ahead and direct-deposited a payment to a Dabhol account, 
unaware of the letter's contents. Mr. Bansal said that he hadn't read the 
letter yet, so he wouldn't comment on it. 
He said the MSEB is eager to pay because the April bill was due on Friday. A 
Dabhol official, while unable to confirm whether payment was received, said 
it would mark ""the first time in history"" that the MSEB has paid on time. Mr. 
Bansal disputed that, saying he believes the two previous bills were also 
paid on time.

El Paso Corp. a villain or scapegoat in Calif. crisis? 
Californians' ire grows as case resumes 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
WASHINGTON -- The lights keep going out in California, and people there want 
someone to blame. 
California is pointing the finger at Texas' energy companies. And first up is 
Houston's El Paso Corp. 
The California Public Utilities Commission has accused El Paso of using its 
power in the natural gas market to drive up gas prices in California. 
That behavior, Californians say, has cost the state's consumers more than 
$3.7 billion in higher energy bills and exacerbated California's dire power 
woes. 
And they want the federal agency that regulates natural gas pipelines to 
force El Paso to hand over the profits from this deal. 
At issue is whether El Paso, the nation's largest gas pipeline company, 
violated federal law by purposely withholding capacity on the biggest gas 
pipeline serving Southern California during a crucial period when gas demand 
was on the rise last year. 
By refusing to make that space available, the state agency alleges, El Paso 
was exercising its ""market power"" to artificially hike prices and keep them 
high. 
El Paso counters that the run-up in gas prices was caused, not by its 
actions, but by an unanticipated -- and unprecedented -- surge in demand. 
And they argue the real problem is pipeline capacity constraints within 
California, not on the supply of gas moving in pipelines bringing gas to the 
state. 
When filed more than a year ago, the state's allegations went all but 
unnoticed by the public. 
But with blackouts expected to roll across California repeatedly this summer, 
the El Paso case has morphed from an esoteric regulatory dispute into the 
test case for the legal battles spawned by the state's power debacle. 
As they wait in darkened elevators and struggle to pay soaring utility bills, 
Californians discern a pattern, argues Bruce Cain, director of the Institute 
of Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. 
""It's the same story with slightly different details,"" Cain said. ""And people 
in California are getting very, very irritable."" 
Gov. Gray Davis and other Democratic leaders have repeatedly blamed 
""out-of-state"" energy firms for the state's energy woes. And they have 
excoriated the Federal Energy Commission for failing to take decisive action 
to give Californians relief. 
As President Bush visits California today, Democrats are pointing to the El 
Paso case to show how companies from Texas are ravaging California. 
Whether El Paso is an appropriate target for their anger remains an open 
question. 
El Paso operates a major pipeline system that transports natural gas from 
producing basins in areas such as West Texas and Oklahoma to Southern 
California and other parts of the Southwest. 
For years, the state's two cash-strapped utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric 
and Southern California Edison, and a local gas distribution company, 
Southern California Gas, owned the rights to transport gas along the Edison 
pipeline system. 
But as California moved to deregulate its electric industry and encourage 
competition, the California Public Utilities Commission prodded the utilities 
to give up their capacity on the El Paso line. 
That made room for other gas marketing firms to move in. 
Houston-based Dynegy held the rights to the pipeline capacity for a while. 
Then an Enron affiliate took a brief turn. 
In February 2000, El Paso's pipeline arm, El Paso Natural Gas Co., opened the 
bidding again for about 1.2 billion cubic feet of pipeline capacity. 
That space accounted for about one-third of the capacity of the El Paso line 
and about one-sixth of the total pipeline capacity running into California. 
An El Paso affiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy Co., won the rights to that 
capacity for 15 months with a $38.5 million bid. 
The California Public Utilities Commission cried foul and asked the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission to force El Paso Merchant to ""disgorge"" its 
profits earned under the contract. 
(El Paso has earned $184 million in pre-tax profits since the contract began, 
Ralph Eads, president of El Paso Merchant, testified last week.) 
The case was turned over to Curtis L. Wagner Jr., an administrative law judge 
at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, who acknowledged it would be a 
bellwether case. 
This much was clear. Gas prices skyrocketed at the California border last 
year, rising from an average of $2.84 a thousand cubic feet in March 2000 to 
as high as $25.08 in December, according to Southern California Edison. 
That was no small issue for California's troubled power market because nearly 
one-quarter of electric generators in California are fired by natural gas. 
In making their case, California officials pointed to the difference between 
gas prices in the gas fields in the San Juan and Permian producing basins and 
in California at the other end of the El Paso line. 
Those price differentials began to widen while Dynegy held the capacity, 
state officials said, only to expand dramatically after El Paso Merchant took 
control. 
El Paso Merchant admits significant portions of its capacity went unused. And 
the company acknowledges it was not successful at finding other players to 
take the space, despite the interest of several potential bidders. 
California officials insist the company only went through the motions of 
trying to find other shippers to take the pipeline capacity because it wanted 
to limit supplies. 
Perhaps the most tantalizing evidence in the case surrounds a Valentine's Day 
2000 presentation made by El Paso Merchant officials to El Paso chief 
executive William Wise. 
The El Paso Merchant documents are still largely held under wraps by the 
court, although portions have been revealed and others were obtained by the 
New York Times. 
In those documents, El Paso officials acknowledged the deal for the pipeline 
capacity would give the company ""more control"" over gas markets, including 
""the ability to influence the physical market,"" the Times reported. 
Lawyers for the plaintiff tried to argue that El Paso officials had crossed 
over the invisible line that is supposed to separate the operations of the 
regulated gas pipeline business and the unregulated gas trading arm. 
Wagner grew irritated with Eads last week when the El Paso Merchant executive 
appeared to equivocate when asked whether Wise approved Merchant Energy's 
plans 
""I feel you're trying to pull something over my eyes, which I don't 
appreciate,"" Wagner said, adding: ""You have to get my blood pressure up to 
get the truth out of you."" 
Wagner responded by ordering Wise to fly to Washington for an unscheduled 
appearance on the witness stand. 
Wise conceded he had, indeed, approved El Paso Merchant's plan to make a bid 
for the pipeline capacity, although he said he left it up to El Paso Merchant 
managers to decide the specifics of that bid. 
For El Paso's part, Harvard University professor Joseph Kalt argues that the 
real problem is a lack of capacity on the systems inside the state of 
California. 
In other words, even if El Paso had delivered more gas along the pipeline, 
the intrastate pipeline network would not have had the capacity to take that 
gas to users there. 
Eads also argued that if El Paso officials had been trying to push up gas 
prices, they would not have used a risk management technique known as 
""hedging."" 
Hedging allows a company to protect itself against a major drop in prices, 
but it also keeps it from reaping the full benefits of a jump in prices. 
El Paso Merchant had suffered $691 million in hedging losses through March 
31, including $429 million in the first quarter of this year. 
""If we had thought that we could drive up prices ... we certainly would not 
have hedged,"" Eads said. 
And as for the infamous Valentine's Day, El Paso officials insist the 
comments were misconstrued, although they still want those documents to be 
kept secret. 
Testimony in the case will resume today. Wagner plans to issue his opinion by 
June 30. 




Enron India: No Comment On Power Tariff Cut Reports

05/29/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

BOMBAY -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co., 
Tuesday declined to comment on whether it would cut its power tariffs after a 
second round of talks with a top panel set up to try and resolve an ongoing 
power supply dispute. 
After a 90-minute meeting between officials from the state and central 
governments, Maharashtra State Electricity Board and Dabhol executives, an 
Enron spokesperson said he wouldn't comment on newspaper reports Tuesday that 
Dabhol Power Chief Operating Officer K. Wade Cline had told domestic lenders 
the company is ready to cut power tariffs by 10%.
Power tariffs, deemed ""unaffordable"" by the state government, are at the core 
of this simmering dispute. The $3.0-billion Dabhol power plant in western 
India will generate 2,184 megawatts of power when the second phase is 
completed later this year. 
After the meeting, Cline said Dabhol Power ""submitted no proposals before the 
committee."" Dabhol Power has consistently maintained it won't renegotiate the 
power purchase agreement between the company and the MSEB, which sets tariffs 
for consumers. 
Industry analysts say Enron may be willing to reduce the power tariffs if it 
can find other buyers for its electricity. At the moment, the state 
electricity utility is the only buyer and has defaulted on $48.0 million of 
power payments. 
Earlier in the day, an Enron spokesperson also declined to comment on a 
report New Delhi has turned down a Maharashtra state proposal that seeks the 
National Thermal Power Corp. or the Power Trading Corp. to buy and distribute 
Dabhol's power. 
Indian state officials said another meeting of the panel will be scheduled 
for later but no date has been fixed yet. 
Indian financial institutions with more than 50% loan exposure to Dabhol 
Power will meet Wednesday to devise a strategy prior to their meeting with 
foreign lenders in early June in a bid to save the power project, senior 
officials at the Industrial Development Bank of India said Monday.

this 30,000 foot level presentation, then follow up with specifics in the Q&A 
session.

Please look it over and we can discuss.  You can call me tomorrow at 
202-466-9166.  Otherwise I'll meet you for dinner tomorrow night at your 
hotel, and I can make substantive changes then, in time for the 9:30 
presentation on Tuesday morning.

Dear Peter,

Everyone has their own definition of paradise. For some it's 
unspoiled beaches and lush tropical jungle. For others it's a more 
developed resort. For others, it's not about the outdoors at all--if 
you're one of those people who thinks a place called ""Sin City"" 
sounds just about perfect, we can help you, too. However you like it, 
Travelocity can help make it happen. Whether you're traveling with 
your sweetie, or just into the romance of traveling, Travelocity can 
help you plan and book the perfect trip. And that sounds like 
paradise to us.

The island of Oahu just might be the perfect place for a romantic 
getaway. That's because if you and your other half can't agree on a 
vacation here, we're not sure you're ever going to agree on anything. 
She likes seclusion, and you like bustle? No problem. Lively Waikiki 
is complemented by dozens of other beaches on the island, some of 
which you'll have practically to yourselves. Or maybe he's a city

Grupo Taca is Currently Offering Sale Fares to Costa Rica!
Costa Rica, with its unspoiled beaches and abundant wildlife, is 
pretty close to paradise on earth. It's not highly developed--don't

and the best birdwatching of your life. If getting away from it all 
is your idea of the perfect vacation, Costa Rica is the place 
for you.

As discussed, we propose a 3% adjustment to the base salaries of the under $100k employees to be included in the NETCo offer letters we may produce next week (this is separate from any promotions we may want to make - we will give you a list by Friday pm). I have spoken with John and Louise and they are in agreement. Following our last conversation I believed you also were in agreement. Please confirm.

The salary increase will NOT be communicated as a subsidy for additional benefits costs, but as a modified/streamlined annual base salary review which we would do at this time of year, in the normal course of business.

After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called ""PACE"", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

with additional comments on the issues and procedures.  I also had
perspective from Nancy Peretsman, who couldn't participate in the call.
There are some differing views, I know, but let me suggest the following
next steps.

First, Tim Koller and I will prepare two things to send around:

1)  A list of the key issues, together with either (a) a suggested stance
for the panel on each; or (b) a clear statement of the different approaches
we could take.

2)  An elaborated treatment of the ""intangibles"" issue, together with more
examples and a shaper definition of a proposed recommendation.

On the basis of these two papers, we will ask each of you to e-mail or fax
your comments to me, and I will circulate the entire package of views to
everyone on the panel.

Tim and I will then prepare an agenda for a face-to-face meeting for late
January or early February.  This will give us time to digest the comments,
talk to one another, etc.  Based on the comments you send me, as well as any
subsequent discussions we have, we will also be able to prepare another
draft report for the meeting, no doubt with several bracketed parts that
will include questions for the group.

Thanks once again for your energetic participation.

681,"Ken,

In my pre-Enron life, I taught history (years and years ago).  

Recently, while culling files in preparation for moving from EB to 3AC,  I 
came across a pamphlet about the origins of the Transwestern Pipeline Company 
and found it very interesting - for the second or third time.

In particular, I am impressed by the vision these pioneers had.  My concern 
is that our Enron preserve some record of those early people and days of the 
entities that make up the bigger Enron.  They were awesome.

In another pre-Enron segment of my life, I worked for a rare and out-of-print 
book dealer.  One of the collections we worked hard to accumulate and then to 
sell as a collection was a group of business histories.  The collection was 
snapped up the first month we put it on the market.  Great business stories 
go on and on being researched by and inspiring new generations of 
entrepreneurs.

Not having practiced my craft as historian for many years, I am no longer 
familiar with the important names in historical writing (except for popular 
historians such as Stephen Ambrose).  If Enron doesn't already have a 
historian, we need an established writer of substantial stature - someone 
whose produced work would reach a lot of people.  

Maybe someone from the Rice University staff could point the way?  Or, maybe 
even someone from Rice has the qualities needed to produce an exciting 
history of Enron.

Because ours is such a great story, I would like to see a project such as 
this pursued.  I would like to know what you think about this suggestion.

Thanks for letting me send this your way.

* Financial Summary

Powerball International, Inc. (the ""Company"") was formed in July
1997 for the purpose of raising capital to invest in a joint venture to
develop certain technology relating to the production of hydrogen,
to generate hydrogen for sale, and to market hydrogen generating
equipment and products. During 2000 the Company acquired the
remaining interest in the joint venture, Powerball Technologies,
LLC, (""Tech"") which is now operated as a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company.  The Company, through Tech, is involved in
research and development efforts of commercializing the
technology.

Powerball expects that initial revenues will be generated primarily by
the construction of a commercial sodium plant in Green River,
Wyoming.  Additional revenues may be derived from the licensing
of the Technology and/or manufacturing and sale of hydrogen
generation systems. Powerball had no revenues for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and has had
no revenues since July 9, 1997.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2001,
Powerball had total operating expenses of $146,455 and $433,550,
respectively, compared to $126,831 and $293,026 For the three and
nine month period ended September 30, 2000.  The increase in
operating expenses is attributable primarily to a substantial increase
in research and development costs of $32,201 and $215,391,
respectively, offset by small decreases in general and administrative
expenses ($8,070 and $8,508, respectively) and professional fees
($1,613 and $10,612, respectively).  The increase in research and
development costs reflects the Company's acquisition of 100%
ownership of Powerball Technologies, LLC (""Tech"") in the second
quarter of fiscal 2000, and consequent responsibility for all the
research costs associated with Tech.

As a result of the merger, Tech is the wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company, and all the expenses of Tech are consolidated with
those expenses of the Company. The Company expects that it will
continue to incur operational losses for the next twelve months,
primarily as a result of expenditures related to the operation of the
Pilot Sodium Plant in West Valley City, Utah and the general
overhead thereto.  The Company believes that the Pilot Plant will
demonstrate successful completion of the milestones set for it before
the end of 2001.  Once continuous operation and product quality
have been verified in the Pilot Plant and Industrial Revenue
Development Bond funding obtained, construction may begin on
the commercial sodium facility in Wyoming that will produce initial
revenues.

* Business Description

 - Powerball Technologies is focused on innovative hydrogen
distribution technologies. At the heart of its technology is the
proprietary hydride pellets or Powerballs(TM) which dramatically
increase the storage density and distribution efficiency for hydrogen
through incremental and on-demand production of hydrogen for a
wide range of applications from industrial hydrogen to portable fuel
cell systems.

 - A revolutionary technology for the production of sodium metal
from sodium hydroxide using natural gas energy is being
demonstrated in a pilot plant facility. Sodium metal as produced by
this recycling plant will be used in the manufacture of sodium
hydride which can be pelletized and individually encapsulated with
polyethylene plastic for the highly dense yet safe storage and
distribution of hydrogen.

 - Hydrogen gas is produced incrementally and upon demand
through the use of a patented portable hydrogen generator system.
The plastic coated pellets are sliced open one at a time within the
generator to provide hydrogen as needed. A gallon of sodium
hydride is capable of producing 1,307 gallons of hydrogen gas,
which is an equivalent hydrogen storage density more than 6.4 times
greater by volume than a compressed hydrogen tank storing
hydrogen at 3,000 psi.

 - Since the powerball fuel pellets can be delivered and utilized at
near room temperature and pressure, the usual problems and costs
for highly pressurized hydrogen or cryogenically stored hydrogen
can be safely eliminated. Additionally, the pellets are considerably
more energy dense and can provide hydrogen for an end user at a
cost less than through the more traditional means of delivering
hydrogen.

 - An exciting future potential use for powerball fuel pellets is for
the supply of hydrogen to fuel cell vehicles. To supply hydrogen
fuel as powerball plastic coated hydride pellets is unique. More
conventional methods for supplying a fuel to a vehicle usually
require that a hydrocarbon is pumped from the ground, refined and
then burned onboard the vehicle to provide energy. There are a
number of problems with a ""business as usual"" approach to fuel
supplies for vehicles.

1. More than 1/2 of all transportation fuel for vehicles is currently
imported from other countries, which makes the USA potentially
vulnerable to and dependant upon other foreign countries.

2. As hydrocarbons are burned onboard vehicles either by reformers
or by combustion engines, the CO2 emissions are exhausted into the
atmosphere. More than 6200 million metric tons of carbon as CO2
waste is exhausted into our air each year. The incredibly large
amounts of CO2 waste are beginning to have costly environmental
impacts on our planet.

3. As hydrocarbon fuels are transferred from refineries into trucks,
from trucks into tanks at fuel stations, and from fuel stations into
vehicles, a large amount of hydrocarbon emissions are produced
which contribute to unhealthy air with negative impacts on health to
millions of people living in cities around the world.

4. Hydrocarbon fuels are produced by the earth at a rate more than
1,000,000 times slower than we are consuming them which means
that hydrocarbons are a non-renewable resource.

 - Powerball fuel pellets can be produced using a variety of energy
sources. Powerball's current recycling plant is powered by natural
gas. When natural gas is used to produce powerballs, CO2 is
produced. Conveniently, CO2 from a central plant can be stored,
unlike CO2 produced onboard a vehicle which cannot be stored and
must be exhausted into the atmosphere. Even more exciting is that
solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric energy, or even fusion
power (if developed) could be used to produce powerballs. Since
powerballs are merely an energy storage medium, and not an energy
source, whatever energy source is available can be used to produce
the coated fuel pellets. Powerball technology, if used on a large
scale nationally, would enable the USA to produce its own fuel for
vehicles without having to rely on other nations for oil. We have
large supplies of natural gas in the USA which can be used to
produce NaH powerballs from waste NaOH. Additionally, as
powerballs are shipped, stored, or transferred from tank to tank,
there would be zero harmful hydrocarbon emissions. Polyethylene
coated pellets cannot evaporate and neither NaOH solution or water
produces harmful emissions.

 - The cost for producing powerballs from waste NaOH and
recycled polyethylene ball shells is greatly reduced by producing
very large volumes of pellets. Powerball is focused on the
production of hydride pellets in large volumes from waste NaOH.
As the technology is improved and as the production volumes
increase, the powerball pellets will represent an inexpensive
alternative source of hydrogen for hydrogen customers who
currently receive hydrogen in bulky and expensive compressed
hydrogen tube trailers. Eventually, as very large volumes of fuel
pellets are produced, the pelletized fuel along with ordinary tap
water could one day become the infrastructure fuel of choice for
fuel cell vehicles.

* Analyst Summary

""The Powerball concept allows for cheap, easy and safe storage of
hydrogen, and requires very little in the way of specialized storage.
There are no special temperature or compression considerations that
need to be worried about.""

-- Princeton University Chemistry Department


The concept behind Powerball Technologies is to tame energy, (so
to speak) and to store one powerful element - sodium (or sodium
hydride) - in order to later get Hydrogen on Demand.

Powerball(TM) fuel pellets store and produce hydrogen on demand.
Each gallon of powerball fuel pellets produces hundreds of gallons
of hydrogen upon contact with water on an as-needed basis.
Powerball fuel pellets offer a safe, compact, and inexpensive
alternative to the delivery, storage and use of compressed or liquid
hydrogen for a wide range of applications which require a clean
source of hydrogen.

Powerball fuel pellets are not an energy source. The Company will
never drill a hole in the ground and discover a large reserve of
hydrogen or hydride pellets. Instead, fuel pellets can be used as an
efficient energy carrier. The hydride pellets can be produced using
energy from diverse energy sources all over the world such as
biomass, natural gas, wind energy, hydroelectric power, and solar
energy. Because they are safe and energy dense they can be
distributed to buses, boats, houses, and hydrogen users by rail, sea,
or highway. Powerball fuel pellets offer new options for the
distribution of energy that do not rely on oil pipelines or electricity
transmission lines. Even a disruption in a natural gas pipeline, for
instance, would not preclude the distribution of powerball fuel
pellets via trucks, trains or ships to where energy is needed.

Additionally, when powerballs are used to provide hydrogen to
vehicles or stationary applications there are no point-of-use
hydrocarbon emissions or CO2 emissions. When powerballs are
transferred from one tank into another tank, there are also zero
emissions. Therefore, powerball fuel pellets are a responsible and
environmentally friendly energy carrier.

Powerball is currently in the  research and development stage in
preparation for commercializing the technology.  Revenue and profit
projections show sales commencing in FY2003.  The projections
show steady growth from $22.9M in FY2003 to $33.6M in FY2004
to $37.0 in FY2005.  Net profits forecasts are equally impressive;
$2.6M in FY2003, $5.4M in FY2004, $6.6M in FY2005.

The associated Earnings Per Share project to $0.79 for FY2003,
$1.64 for FY2004, and $2.00 for FY2005.  We place Powerball in
the Energy sector.  Utilizing the associated 16 to 1 Price to Earnings
ratio for this sector, we target PowerBall's price to:

  o $12.64 for FY2003, a 174% return on investment from price at
recommendation

  o $26.24 for FY2004, a 470% return on investment from price at
recommendation

  o $32.00 for FY2005, a 595% return on investment from price at
recommendation

Note: To meet the suggested target prices, the Company would have
to trade at least at the Energy sector multiples and the Company
would have to achieve earnings and revenue estimates provided by
management for this report. A divergence either up or down from
the projections could materially affect the target prices.

stock is above its 50-day moving average at 3.42 which also
confirms its Bullish (up) trend. The stock is extremely overbought
according to the Stochastic indicator (84.10), so look for a possible
pullback.

Long Term Opinion: HOLD
On a long-term technical basis, the stock (PRBL) is trading below
its 200-day moving average which implies it is in a negative trend.
The stock has broken down through support at 5.56, so look for
new support at 4.34.

The stock has support at 4.34 and 4.09. If the stock breaks down
through support at 4.34 then it will probably continue lower to 4.09.
The stock has resistance at 5.10 and at 5.56. If the stock breaks up
through resistance at 5.10 then it will probably continue higher to
5.56. The 200-day moving average is at 5.10. This will also act as
resistance.

735,"FERC Restructures California Power Market

Responding to a California power market gone haywire and teetering on the 
brink of operational and financial disaster, FERC Friday issued a series of 
remedial measures, virtually stripping the Cal-PX and Cal-ISO of their 
control of the market and calling market stakeholders together to negotiate 
bilateral forward contracts. 

The Commission's main action, effective with the issuance of the order after 
the Friday afternoon meeting, removes the requirement that California 
utilities buy and sell exclusively through the California Power Exchange 
(Cal-PX) and clears the way for bi-lateral contracts in the forward market. 
FERC scheduled a settlement conference for Dec. 19 in Washington of parties 
in the state's power market to negotiate those contracts. 

""California does [not] have the benefit of a competitive market,"" Chairman 
James Hoecker said, noting he had heard the state's power market called 
""crisis by design."" The design was ""an unworkable state law, the product of 
command and control that described in detail"" exactly how the market should 
function. ""It wasn't competition,"" Hoecker said. ""It's time to get serious 
about saving the future of competitive markets...Competition did not fail in 
principle at either the wholesale or retail level because it was never 
well-conceived or tried. This version of competition was a disaster."" 

Commissioner William Massey defended the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission's backing away from price caps. ""Rather than cap the spot market 
created by the state of California, the order would simply shrink its size 
and diminish its influence."" This will ""give back participants' ability to 
find the right price; This ability is what California has taken away from 
that market."" 

Massey said the action would allow bilateral transactions, support forward 
contracts, and allow the parties to manage risk. He urged the California 
Public Utilities Commission to ""step up to its responsibilities"" in 
supporting the FERC-directed activities. 

Massey said the transfer of wealth in what he described as the ""apocalypse"" 
in California ""is absolutely staggering. The two largest utilities are 
virtually bankrupt."" He predicted a court, acting on accepted law and 
precedent, would eventually rule the utilities are entitled to recover the 
costs from customers, spreading the costs out over the entire state. 

PG&E Corp. officials lambasted the Commission's actions, saying they left 
California's electric customers ""exposed to price gouging and future electric 
supply reliability uncertainty."" 

""The California wholesale market is broken. And we are extremely disappointed 
by the insufficiency of today's FERC order,"" PG&E officials said in a 
statement. ""The remedies outlined in the order do not go nearly far enough to 
provide a solution that ensures reliability of the state's electric supply 
and equally importantly, provides relief from future price gouging,"" the 
Northern California utility company said. PG&E said it was particularly 
disappointed that FERC did not call for retroactive price refunds for 
California electric customers, as was requested by Gov. Gray Davis. The 
utility also said it was ""especially troubled"" that FERC shortened the 
timeframe for the electric price cap from the end of 2002 to April 2001, 
""leaving customers exposed during the high-demand summer season."" 

Sen Dianne Feinstein, (D-CA), said FERC's action was unacceptable. ""Rome is 
burning, our utilities are close to bankruptcy, Californians are facing major 
blackouts, and the Commission is fiddling."" 

Hoecker said similar competitive problems in states in the Pacific Northwest 
have led to pleas from governors and others for regional price caps. But he 
pointed to the fact that FERC is severely limited in what it can do in that 
region. For one, it lacks authority over the Bonneville Power Authority and 
other federal operations there, which make up a major portion of the market. 
Further, there is no Northwest spot market that can be capped in the way caps 
operate in California. There also would be problems with the many purchasers 
who already had hedged or protected themselves in some way. Hoecker strongly 
urged Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to convene a conference to try to 
identify regional problems, and offered his help in this. 

Commissioners Curt Hebert and Massey said they would issue concurring 
opinions. Hoecker said he will submit a concurring opinion next week on items 
such as RTOs that are beyond the scope of the order. The Commission's 
actions, which went beyond recommendations it had made earlier (see Daily 
GPI, Nov. 2), came at an emergency meeting following a week of continuous 
power alerts and emergency measures to avoid rolling blackouts in the state. 

The Commission's reforms call for: 

 No retroactive refunds for California customers; 

 Elimination of the requirement that California's three investor-owned 
utilities ",James Hoecker Hoecker William Massey Massey Gray Davis Sen Dianne Feinstein Bill Richardson Hebert,,"FERC California Power Market Cal-PX Cal-ISO Commission the California Power Exchange the California

738,"PG&E to Expand Pacific Northwest System

Responding to tight energy supplies in the Pacific Northwest and California, 
PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group revealed plans Wednesday to begin an open 
season early next year, kicking off a five-year expansion effort. The first 
phase would add 200 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity out of western 
Canada on its Gas Transmission-Northwest (GTN) pipeline system. The PG&E GTN 
group expects the phase one expansion to be in service by November 2002 at 
the latest. 

""As we have been anticipating, the western natural gas market is at a 
critical point in the need for additional pipeline capacity,"" said Thomas B. 
King, president of the PG&E National Energy Group (PG&E NEG) West Region. 
""Gas supplies into the Pacific Northwest and California are very tight. At 
the same time, the market is strong and growing, and the PG&E Gas 
Transmission Northwest pipeline system has been operating at or near maximum 
capacity levels for the greater part of the year. We believe GTN is now 
positioned for an aggressive expansion period that will result in additional 
supplies of natural gas ","Thomas B.

Strong business mix pushes energy firm past estimates 

MONDAY, JANUARY 22, 2001 11:19:00 AM EST 
By Andrew Kelly
HOUSTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, on Monday reported a sharp rise in 
fourth-quarter operating earnings, surpassing expectations, as online trading 
drove strong growth at its core wholesale energy operations.
Enron said it took a net non-recurring after-tax charge of $287 million in 
the fourth quarter related to its troubled water affiliate Azurix Corp. AZX 
</quotes/quotes.asp?symb=AZX&source=>. Enron announced plans last year to 
finance a buyout that would take Azurix private.
Earnings before non-recurring items rose 34 percent, to $347 million, or 41 
cents a share, from $259 million or 31 cents a share a year earlier.
Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 35 cents a share, according to 
First Call/Thomson Financial.
In early Monday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron's shares were 
up $3-1/8, or 4.41 percent, at $74.
Fourth-quarter net income including the Azurix charge was $60 million, or 5 
cents per share.
The company's fourth-quarter revenues rose 271 percent from a year earlier, 
to $40.8 billion.
""The impressive thing is the overall growth that they experienced,"" said 
Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. ""I think it had been in most people's 
forecasts that they would have to do something to clean up Azurix.""
ANALYST MAINTAINS BUY RATING
Eassey said he was retaining a ""buy"" rating on Enron's stock and considered 
the company one of his top picks.
""I think that they will sustain a higher growth rate on average for the next 
several years going forward, as they have for the past 10 years, because of 
their innovation and their way of attacking the markets,"" he said.
Analysts pointed to the strong volume growth in Enron's core energy business 
and played down the significance of the charge for Azurix.
Enron, which has branched out beyond energy into fields such as broadband 
telecommunications and metals trading, saw its stock rise 87 percent in 2000, 
outpacing a 54 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's utilities index  
</quotes/quotes.asp?symb=&source=>.
Electricity and natural gas stocks were boosted by safe-haven buying in 2000 
as investors lost faith in other sectors.
So far this year, Enron's stock is down 12 percent, broadly in line with the 
S&P utilities index, which has fallen as investors have cashed in some of 
last year's gains. Concern about possible fallout from California's power 
crisis has also hurt the index.
Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling said in a 
conference call that the company's fourth-quarter earnings were not 
significantly impacted by the power crisis in California, where rolling 
electricity blackouts were imposed last week and the state's top two 
utilities are close to bankruptcy as they face soaring wholesale electricity 
costs.
""We do not expect the California situation to have any significant effect on 
Enron's financial outlook, specifically our ability to hit 2001 targets,"" he 
added.
Meanwhile, Enron said its physical wholesale gas and power deliveries rose 90 
percent in the fourth quarter from year-earlier levels, with strong growth 
both in North America and Europe.
EnronOnline, the company's Web-based trading system, completed its first full 
year of operation in 2000, executing 548,000 transactions with a gross value 
of $336 billion.
Besides gas and power, Enron uses the online system to make markets in 
commodities such as pulp and paper, petrochemicals, metals and broadband 
capacity, also known as bandwidth.
ORIGINS AS PIPELINE COMPANY
Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron has pursued opportunities 
created by deregulation to become North America's biggest wholesale gas and 
electricity marketer. It is building a similar business in Europe, where 
energy markets are also gradually opening up to competition.
Enron regards its knowledge of volatile energy and commodity markets as its 
key strength, allowing it to profit from price swings while saving money for 
its customers and managing their exposure to potentially costly movements in 
prices.
Fourth-quarter earnings before interest and taxes at Enron's wholesale energy 
business almost tripled from a year earlier, to $777 million.
Enron Energy Services, which helps business customers reduce their energy 
costs, posted earnings before interest and taxes of $33 million, up from $7 
million in the fourth quarter of 1999.
On Friday Enron Energy Services said it had signed an energy management 
agreement with Owens-Illinois Inc. OI </quotes/quotes.asp?symb=OI&source=> 
worth $2 billion over 10 years, its biggest deal to date.
Enron said its broadband telecommunications business, which was launched last 
year and is still in the start-up phase, posted a loss of $32 million on 
revenues of $63 million for the fourth quarter. Enron has said it will take a 
few years for the business to become profitable.
The company sells bandwidth on its own fiber optic network and is also 
pioneering the development of standardized tradable bandwidth contracts.",Andrew Kelly Azurix Donato Eassey Jeff Skilling,"$287 million $347 million 41

793,"Hi Dr. Leerburger,

Thanks for your feedback.  I know how busy you must be - I have three kids (7,5 and 2) so I realize how precious time off is.  I applyed to DIA, NSA and CIA about three weeks ago.  I got letters back stating my application had been recieved.  The DIA said I have been put into their applicant pool.  My company (Enron) has offered me a position in London managing a trading desk for crude oil and refined products.  They want me to move over in January or Febuary, so hopefully I'll know something before then.  If I'm not offered anything by then, I'll probably go and plan on applying to Georgetown in one to two years.  I really hope I'm offered a position now - London would be interesting - but with everything that is going on now, I'd rather start this new career now.

Thanks again for your feedback and I hope to speak with you when time permits.  If you are teaching the Threat Assesment course at AMU Spring 2002, I'll probably be in your class.

801,"This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option 
pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and 
calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls 
are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will 
result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index 
premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

worded would require all parties concurrence on any press release.  In
meeting the spirit of the CA, TransCanada would like to state that it
would like to meet that deadline for issuing a press release and would
ask each of you to indicate whether you would support that or not.  We
will have some points available within a week outlining what we feel the
release would say but it would be similar to what we discussed
previously.

- on the issue of entities to be covered by the CA, we would ask that El
Paso consider a corporate entity rather than ANR.  Our reason is that
resources are likely to be seconded from groups other than ANR within El
Paso and we would like the CA to cover all relevant entities and
personnel directly than indirectly through ANR.

As a final note, the first draft of the Joint development agreement
should be ready late Wednesday.  Recognizing that Thursday is a holiday,
the draft should be on your email by Friday morning for your review. -

I did spot a potential issue with the Transport piece of the proposal.  If ENA holds transport on NNG, it cannot simply sell use of that capacity to Unocal.  The shipper of record with NNG needs to hold title to the gas that is being transported.  For Unocal to utilize this capacity, they would need to either directly contract with NNG for such capacity, or ENA would acquire the capacity then ""Capacity Release"" the capacity to Unocal.  The Capacity Release would be subject to NNG bulletin board posting requirements.    Let me know if you want to discuss further.

We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.

The following are the most significant revisions which have been made to the August 21 drafts:

1.	Any Utility Invoice Credits from ""green"" power will accrue to the benefit of EESI, rather than Kinko's.  Section 2.8 of the Master has been restored to the original ""form"" version to reflect this.

2.	Cross-default language with respect to Kinko's and its subsidiaries has been added to Section 3.1 of the Master. 

3.	The ""deemed insecurity"" provision has been deleted from Section 3.6 of the Master.

4.	The right to terminate because of a change in law has been made unilateral in favor of EESI, rather than reciprocal.  Section 3.8 of the Master has been restored to the original ""form"" version to reflect this.

We are hoping to send the drafts out to Kinko's this afternoon.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments with respect to the attached documents.

916,"A Charlotte, NC man, having purchased a box of very rare and expensive
   cigars, insured them against fire, among other hazards. Within a month,
   having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made
   even
   his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against
   the
   insurance company. In his claim, the man stated that the cigars were
   lost
   ""in a series of small fires"".
   The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that
   the
   man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The man sued ... and
   won! The ruling judge agreed that the claim was frivolous. He stated,
   nevertheless, that the man held a valid policy from the company in which

   it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that

   it would insure against fire, without further defining what would be
   considered to be an ""unacceptable fire,"" and was obligated to pay the
   claim. Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the
   insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the
   rare cigars he had lost in the ""fires"".
   And now the good part...After the man cashed the check, the insurance
   company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance
   claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the
   man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and
   sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine.",,"15,000 $24,000.00 fine",
917,"1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

Normally, there is a short period during startup when the NOx goes to 
approximately 35 ppm.  This is very short in duration and occurs while the 
gas turbine is loading.  Our site is permitted to normally operate between 
70-100% turbine load.  These emissions have subsided within the few minutes 
required to attain 70% load.  Our permit constraints require that we do not 
exceed our emissions limits on a 3 hour rolling avarage.  Therefore these 
short-term startup emissions are not an issue.  

CO is a calculated value.  I do not have short-term CO2 numbers at present.  
However, I don't believe they are at issue since they are related to excess 
air which is pretty high during startup.

There is a condition called lean-lean firing which can and has occured from 
time to time.  A transition takes place above 40MW when the nozzle gas 
arrangement normally goes to a firing state called ""premix steady state.""  If 
this transition fails for some reason, the machine goes into a lean-lean 
state and the NOx level can rise to 40-50 ppm.  The turbine activates and 
operator alarm when this happens.  We can count the number of occurances that 
this has happened on one hand at Caledonia.  When this conditions occurs, the 
operators correct the condition by reducing the load to about 35MW and then 
increase the load again.  Typically this resolves the faulty transition and 
it configures the nozzles correctly on the second attempt.



2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

No industrial stormwater permit is required at Caledonia.



3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

The fuel sampling schedule for both sulphur content and heating value at 
Caledonia is once per month.

strategy of selling the assets to PNE.  They are as follows (with 
comments/status provided):

Wisvest - both PNE and Ecogas are working towards a settlement/restructuring 
which will include them releasing Ecogas from all obligations and dismissal 
of their pending suit.  We're trying to get this completed prior to closing.
Tom Hall - Ecogas owes Tom $41K (Tom says $46K) for which we've offered to 
settle with thim pari-passu with all other creditors at 50 c/$ ($21K).  He 
has rejected the offer and is planning to move forward with depositions, 
etc...  Our plan per my conversation w/ Lisa yesterday is to escrow the money 
($21K) we offered in the Settlement sent to him last Friday, 12/1.
Lyon Credit/United Hudson Bank - I am trying to contact them to see if I can 
get them to either dismiss the suit or settle for $25K or less.
WMI/Davis St. - Richard is supposed to be contacting WMI's legal to discuss.
Victoria Sterling - I am trying to contact her to see if she'll settle for 
$25K or less.
ISCO (has sued EZ Products, Ecogas and Enron) - Richard is supposed to 
contact their legal counsel to discuss merits of suing Enron.

Is there anything else we should be doing to mitigate potential problems if 
we can't get any of them to settle/dismiss their suits?  Who is handling 
responses, filings, pleadings, etc... for each of these cases while they're 
status is uncertain?  Currently, we have no counsel re: Victoria Sterling and 
ISCO.  I'm not sure who's doing what on Wisvest, Tom Hall or Lyon Credit.  
Previously, Milbank Tweed was handling WMI but I haven't seen or heard of 
anything being done so I'm not sure about this either.

strategy by bankruptcy counsel in the event they won't settle and end up

950,"Hey Bronwyn,

I just realized I never emailed you back ( I am a bad, bad person).  Glad to 
hear things are going well with you.  It was so neat to run into you in 
Houston, I see your brother around the building quite a bit but I don't think 
he recognizes me.  I'll have to make a point to reintroduce myself the next 
time I see him.  

So what's new with you?  Have you moved?  I know you were thinking about LA a 
while back...I've got a couple of friends from high school who are living out 
there and are really having a good time.  Anyway, I completely understand the 
urge to try something new.  I too am thinking of making a move before next 
summer ( I don't know exactly where, but somewhere outside of Texas...I 
really need to experience something different).  Speaking of which, Emily is 
in London going to graduate school right now.  I've already been to visit her 
once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there.  I would 
actually love to go, if there was a job with Enron there that interested me.  

As for my dating life, it is relatively unchanged.  I was seeing one guy for 
a while, really liked him, things were going great ( I thought )...then he 
seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos. into things to tell me he has 
issues and that he'd been married before.  Needless to say, that was pretty 
much the end of things.  It's made me a little hesitant when it comes to 
meeting new guys, but at the same time I had so much fun in the beginning 
that I'm still optimistic about my dating future.  How about you?

Concerning Kappa...I'll give you a run down on everyone I still keep in touch 
with.  Corey's in Law School at Texas ( doing great of course) and has 
already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in Galveston when she 
graduates.  Jessica Bateman is now Jessica Pulliam - and she too is in Law 
School at Texas and has secured a federal clerkship with a judge in Dallas 
when she graduates.  Elizabeth's is in Med School in San Antonio and dating a 
fellow med student there.  Stephanie Spence is now Stephanie Williams and is 
living and working in Dallas.  Lisa Meador is getting married next April to a 
guy from Texas ( he was a KA, there Brad Thealman (sp?) ) who is absolutely 
perfect for her.  That about sums it up, but if there's anyone else you're 
wondering about just ask...I can probably find out some scoop.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

ISSUE

For a number of business reasons, a company may enter into contracts that are 
indexed to, and sometimes settled in, its own stock. Examples of these
contracts include written put options, written call options (and warrants), 
purchased put options, purchased call options, forward sale contracts, and 
forward
purchase contracts. These contracts may be settled using a variety of 
settlement methods, or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice 
of
settlement methods. The settlement methods are:

     Physical settlement - the party designated in the contract as the buyer 
delivers the full stated amount of cash to the seller, and the seller 
delivers the full
     stated number of shares to the buyer.

     Net share settlement - the party with a loss delivers to the party with 
a gain shares with a current fair value equal to the gain.

     Net cash settlement - the party with a loss delivers to the party with a 
gain a cash payment equal to the gain, and no shares are exchanged.

The contracts described above may be either freestanding or embedded in 
another financial instrument. A freestanding contract is entered into 
separate and
apart from any of the company's other financial instruments or equity 
transactions, or it is entered into in conjunction with some other 
transaction and is legally
detachable and separately exercisable.

This Issue applies only to freestanding derivative financial instruments (for 
example, forward contracts, options, and warrants). This Issue does not apply 
to
security price guarantees or other financial instruments indexed to, or 
otherwise based on, the price of the issuer's stock that are issued in 
connection with a
purchase business combination [Note See STATUS section.], nor does it address 
the accounting for either the derivative component or the financial instrument
when the derivative component is embedded in and not detachable from the 
financial instrument. This Issue does not address the accounting for 
contracts that
are issued to compensation employees or to acquire goods or services from 
nonemployees.

The issue is how freestanding contracts that are indexed to, and potentially 
settled in, a company's own stock should be classified and measured.

EITF DISCUSSION

A. Framework for Accounting

The Task Force discussed the accounting for freestanding contracts that are 
indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock and reached 
several
consensuses, as described below. The consensuses in this Issue are to be 
applied to all freestanding derivative financial instruments that are indexed 
to, and
potentially settled in, a company's own stock; however, nonpublic companies 
may continue to apply the consensus in Issue No. 88-9, ""Put Warrants ,"" to the
instruments covered by that Issue. Hereinafter, the framework for accounting 
that is established in this Issue is referred to as the ""Model.""

(1) Initial balance sheet classification

The initial balance sheet classification generally is based on the concept 
that contracts that require net cash settlement are assets or liabilities and 
contracts that
require settlement in shares are equity instruments. If the contract provides 
the company with a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares, the 
Model
assumes settlement in shares; if the contract provides the counterparty with 
a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares, the Model assumes 
net cash
settlement. However, this Model is not applicable when settlement 
alternatives do not have the same economic value attached to them or when one 
of the
settlement alternatives is fixed or contains caps or floors. In those 
situations, the accounting for the instrument (or combination of instruments) 
should be based
on the economic substance of the transaction.1

          1 For example, if a freestanding contract, issued together with 
another instrument, requires that the issuer provide to the holder a fixed or
          guaranteed return such that the instruments are, insubstance, debt, 
the issuer should account for both instruments as liabilities, regardless of 
the
          settlement terms of the freestanding contract.

Accordingly, unless the economic substance indicates otherwise, contracts 
would be initially classified as equity, or as assets or liabilities, in the 
following
situations:

Equity instruments

     Contracts that require physical settlement or net share settlement

     Contracts that give the company a choice of net cash settlement or 
settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net share settlement).

Assets or liabilities

     Contracts that require net cash settlement

     Contracts that give the counterparty a choice of net cash settlement or 
settlement in shares (physical settlement or net share settlement).

(2) Initial measurement, and subsequent balance sheet classification and 
measurement

The Model requires that all instruments be initially measured at fair value 
and subsequently accounted for based on the initial classification and the 
assumed or
required settlement method in (1) above.2 Contracts that are initially 
classified as equity are accounted for in permanent equity. If physical 
settlement was
assumed or required and the company is obligated to deliver cash as part of 
the physical settlement,3 then public companies should refer to ASR 268, which
provides guidance by analogy for those transactions, and account for the 
transactions as provided below under ""Equity instruments - temporary equity.""

          2 For contracts that are classified as equity instruments that 
provide the company with a choice between either net share settlement or 
physical
          settlement that may require that the company deliver cash, net 
share settlement should be assumed. For contracts that are classified as 
equity
          instruments that provide the counterparty with a choice of either 
net share settlement or physical settlement that may require that the company
          deliver cash, physical settlement should be assumed.

          3 For example, if the company sells put options indexed to its own 
stock that enable the holder to sell shares back to the company at the strike
          price.

Equity instruments - permanent equity

     Contracts that require that the company deliver shares as part of a 
physical settlement or a net share settlement should be initially measured at 
fair value
     and reported in permanent equity. Subsequent changes in fair value 
should not be recognized.

     Contracts that give the company a choice of (a) net cash settlement or 
settlement in shares (including net share settlement, or physical settlement 
that
     requires that the company deliver shares) or (b) either net share 
settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash 
should be
     initially measured at fair value and reported in permanent equity. 
Subsequent changes in fair value should not be recognized. If such contracts 
are
     ultimately settled in a manner that requires that the company deliver 
cash, the amount of cash paid or received should be reported as a reduction 
of, or
     an addition to, contributed capital.

Equity instruments - temporary equity4

          4 Classification and measurement in temporary equity is required 
for public companies. ASR 268 provides guidance by analogy for transactions
          classified as temporary equity.

     Contracts that (a) require that the company deliver cash as part of a 
physical settlement, (b) give the company a choice of either net cash 
settlement or
     physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash, or (c) 
give the counterparty a choice of either net share settlement or physical 
settlement
     that requires that the company deliver cash should be initially measured 
at fair value and reported in permanent equity, and an amount equal to the 
cash
     redemption amount under the physical settlement should be transferred to 
temporary equity.

Assets or liabilities

     Contracts that are initially classified as assets or liabilities should 
be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
and disclosed
     in the financial statements. If contracts initially classified as assets 
or liabilities are ultimately settled in shares, any gains or losses on those 
contracts
     should continue to be included in earnings.

B. Hedging

The SEC Observer stated that the SEC staff has consistently held the position 
that hedge accounting is not permitted for transactions involving the 
contracts
within the scope of this Issue because those transactions have not met all 
the criteria of Statement 80. The SEC staff also believes that hedge 
accounting for
transactions involving those contracts is inconsistent with paragraph 28 of 
Opinion 9.

Because of the SEC staff's position, the Task Force decided to end its 
discussion of whether the contracts described above can qualify for hedge 
accounting.

C. Application of the Model to Specific Instruments

The following reflects several Task Force consensuses with respect to the 
application of the Model, described in Section A of this Issue, to certain 
freestanding
derivative financial instruments that are indexed to, and potentially settled 
in, a company's own stock.

(1) Written put options5 and forward purchase contracts

          5 Includes shareholder rights (SHARP rights) issued by the company 
to shareholders that give the shareholders the right to put a specified number
          of common shares to the company for cash.

Description

The company (the buyer) agrees to buy from the seller shares at a specified 
price at some future date. The contract may be settled by physical 
settlement, net
share settlement, or net cash settlement, or the issuing company or the 
counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods.6

          6 Application of the Model to purchased call options is discussed 
in C(3).

Consensus

The Model would be applied as follows:
                                                One Settlement Method

                                                                 Physical (a)
                                                                              
        Net Share
                                                                              
                            Net Cash



 (1) Initial Classification:

 Equity

                                                                      x

                                                                              
            x

 Asset Liability
                                                                              
                               x

 (2) Initial Measurement, Subsequent Classification and Measurement:

(3) Purchased call options

Description

The company (the buyer) purchases call options that provide it with the 
right, but not the obligation, to buy from the seller, shares of the 
company's stock at a
specified price. If the options are exercised, the contract may be settled by 
physical settlement, net share settlement, or net cash settlement, or the 
issuing
company or the counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods.

Consensus

The company should follow the table included in (2) above in accounting for 
the call options.

(4) Detachable stock purchase warrants

Description

An enterprise issues senior subordinated notes with a detachable warrant that 
gives the holder both the right to purchase 6,250 shares of the enterprise's 
stock
for $75 per share and the right (that is, a put) to require that the 
enterprise repurchase all or any portion of the warrant for at least $2,010 
per share at a date
several months after the maturity of the notes in about 7 years.

Consensus

The proceeds should be allocated between the debt liability and the warrant 
and the resulting discount should be amortized in accordance with Opinion 21.
The warrants should be considered, in substance, debt and accounted for as a 
liability because the settlement alternatives for the warrants do not have the
same economic value attached to them and they provide the holder with a 
guaranteed return in cash that is significantly in excess of the value of the 
share
settlement alternative on the issuance date.

(5) Put warrants

Description

Put warrants are instruments with characteristics of both warrants and put 
options. The holder of the instrument is entitled to exercise (a) the warrant 
feature to
acquire the common stock of the issuer at a specified price, (b) the put 
option feature to put the instrument back to the issuer for a cash payment, 
or in some
cases, (c) both the warrant feature to acquire the common stock and the put 
option feature to put that stock back to the issuer for a cash payment. Put
warrants are frequently issued concurrently with debt securities of the 
issuer, are detachable from the debt, and may be exercisable only under 
specified
conditions. The put feature of the instrument may expire under varying 
circumstances, for example, with the passage of time or if the issuer has a 
public stock
offering. Under Opinion 14, a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of 
debt with detachable warrants must be allocated to those warrants.

Consensus

Because the contract gives the counterparty the choice of cash settlement or 
settlement in shares, public companies should report the proceeds from the
issuance of put warrants as liabilities and subsequently measure the put 
warrants at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. 
Nonpublic
companies may continue to classify and measure the put warrants in accordance 
with the consensus in Issue 88-9.

D. Earnings per Share

The Task Force reached the following consensus on how written put options 
affect the earnings-per-share calculation:

If the written put options are ""in the money"" during the period being 
reported on, the potential dilutive effect on earnings per share should be 
computed using
the reverse treasury stock method. Under that method, the incremental number 
of shares is computed as (a) the number of shares that would need to be issued
for cash at the then current market price to obtain cash to satisfy the put 
obligation less (b) the number of shares received from satisfying the puts.

The Task Force discussed whether it should comprehensively address issues 
relating to earnings per share in this Issue. The Task Force agreed that the 
FASB
should address the issues relating to earnings per share as part of its 
project on earnings per share. [Note: See STATUS section.]

STATUS

In February 1997, the FASB issued Statement 128, which supersedes Opinion 15. 
Statement 128 is effective for financial statements for both interim and
annual periods ending after December 15, 1997, and earlier application is not 
permitted.

Statement 128 affirms the consensus reached by the Task Force on how written 
put options affect the earnings per share calculation. That is, in computing
diluted EPS, Statement 128 requires use of the reverse treasury stock method 
to account for the dilutive effect of written put options and similar 
contracts that
are ""in the money"" during the reporting period. Statement 128 states that 
purchased options should not be reflected in the computation of diluted EPS 
because
to do so would be antidilutive. At the July 23 and November 18-19, 1998 
meetings, an FASB staff representative made an announcement (Topic No. D-72,
""Effects of Contracts That May Be Settled in Stock or Cash on the Computation 
of Diluted Earnings per Share "") that for those contracts that provide the
company with a choice of settlement methods, the company shall assume that 
the contract will be settled in shares. That presumption may be overcome if 
past
experience or a stated policy provides a reasonable basis to believe that it 
is probable that the contract will be paid partially or wholly in cash. For 
contracts in
which the counterparty controls the means of settlement, past experience or a 
stated policy is not determinative. Accordingly, in those situations, the more
dilutive of cash or share settlement should be used.

At the July 23-24, 1997 meeting, the Task Force addressed the accounting for 
contingent consideration issued to effect a purchase business combination in
Issue No. 97-8. ""Accounting for Contingent Consideration Issued in a Purchase 
Business Combination ."" The Task force observed that Issue 96-13 should
be applied to freestanding contracts that are indexed to, and potentially 
settled in, a company's own stock if those instruments meet the criteria in 
Issue 97-8
for recording as part of the cost of the business acquired in a purchase 
business combination.

A related issue has been discussed in Issue No. 98-12, ""The Application of 
Issue No. 96-13 to Forward Equity Sales Transactions ."" That Issue deals with
the accounting and earnings per share treatment of situations in which a 
freestanding derivative instrument (a forward contract) that is indexed to, 
and
potentially settled in, a company's own stock is issued concurrent with the 
issuance of shares of the company's stock. This Issue is limited to 
situations in which
the party to whom the common stock was sold is also the counterparty to the 
forward contract.

Another related issue has been discussed in Issue No. 99-1, ""Accounting for 
Debt Convertible into the Stock of a Consolidated Subsidiary ."" That Issue
deals with the accounting in the consolidated financial statements for debt 
issued by a consolidated subsidiary or a parent company that is convertible 
into the
stock of a consolidated subsidiary. As part of the discussion of Issue 99-1, 
Task Force members agreed to consider further whether to clarify this Issue by
indicating that equity shares of any entity under the control of the 
consolidated entity are considered ""a company's own stock.""

A related issue was discussed at the May 19-20, 1999 meeting in Issue No. 
99-3, ""Application of Issue No. 96-13 to Derivative Instruments with Multiple
Settlement Alternatives ."" That Issue deals with how certain derivative 
contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock that 
contain
multiple settlement alternatives should be accounted for.

The Task Force discussed another related issue in Issue No. 99-7, ""Accounting 
for an Accelerated Share Repurchase Program ."" That Issue addressed the
accounting for, and pooling-of-interests implications of, purchasing treasury 
stock and simultaneously entering into a forward contract indexed to the
company's own shares.

At the March 16, 2000 meeting, the Task Force discussed a related issue in 
Issue No. 00-6, ""Accounting for Freestanding Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, the Stock of a Consolidated 
Subsidiary ."" That Issue addresses how freestanding derivative instruments 
entered into
by a parent company that are indexed to, and potentially settled in, the 
stock of a consolidated subsidiary should be classified and measured in the
consolidated financial statements.

Another related issue was discussed at the March 16, 2000 meeting in Issue 
No. 00-7, ""Application of Issue No. 96-13 to Equity Derivative Instruments 
That
Contain Certain Provisions That Require Net Cash Settlement If Certain Events 
outside the Control of the Issuer Occur ."" That Issue deals with how certain
derivative contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own 
stock that require a cash payment by the issuer upon the occurrence of future
events outside the control of the issuer should be accounted for.

However, I think it is important that we keep the March 5th session specific

993,"On March 14, 01, FERC issued an ""Order removing obstacles to increased 
electric generation and gas supply in the West..""  (Docket No. EL01-47).

 Most significantly, FERC authorizes industrials in WSCC to sell power to 
licensed power marketers (like EPMI and EES) effective 3/14/01 through 
12/31/01.  The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer 
license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making filings for the 
industrials).  (This is similar to the authorization that EPMI and EES 
requested nationwide earlier this year -- we should hear from FERC on that 
request by mid-May.)

In addition, FERC authorizes DSM sales at wholesale at market based rates.

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations in the WSCC and 
used primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public 
utilities"" subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at 
wholesale) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to non-affiliated 
entities (like EPMI or EES) without prior notice under section 205 of FPA 
(would usually require 60 day advance notice filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff -- must file a rate 
schedule at FERC for this, but FERC will be receptive to granting waivers and 
authorizations.
 -- This authorization expires after 12/31/01.
Effective 3/14/01 through 12/31/01, retail customers in WSCC, as permitted by 
state laws and regulations, and wholesale customers are authorized to reduce 
consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale at 
market-based rates.  These transactions can occur in several ways:  An 
aggregator can line up retail load to acquire enough negawatts to resell in a 
manner similar to what aggregators do when they sell power to retail load 
under retail choice programs.  In addition, wholesale and retail load with 
contract demand service could resell their contract demands if the value of 
power is greater than the value of consumption.  Similar quarterly reports 
would be due by EPMI/EES.
NOTE:  the industrial still has to obtain the interconnection agreement with 
transmission provider (may need new interconnection facilities, etc.) 
Remember that you still need to get transmission on OASIS when the power is 
wheeled away from the industrial.

Other initiatives in the order:

Utilities are encouraged to make DSM arrangements with wholesale customers.  
FERC waives the prior notice requirement for amended contracts that are 
required to be filed at FERC.
Clarifies that DSM should be treated consistenly with all other types of 
incremental and out-of-pocket costs for utilities.
Reminds transmission providers to keep ATCs current, including CBM and TRM.
Provides incentive rates for new transmission projects that can be in service 
by July 1 (and to a lesser extent -- by November 1 of 01 and 02).
Considers ""rolled in"" rates for generation interconnection (rather than 
direct assignment that we have now.)
Extends temporary waivers through 12/31/01 of operating and efficiency 
standards for QFs.  Allows QF to sell output above historical supply though a 
negotiated bilateral agreement at market based rates, if sold in California 
and the WSCC.
FERC will review interconnection issues that impede generation from reaching 
load (ie, if a utility does not act within time limits on interconnection 
requests, etc.)
Provides for increased staff and quicker gas pipeline additions review.

Please let me know if you would like the order.  Ray Alvarez (202-466-9170) 
and I (713-853-7007) can assist you with this.  Thanks.

utilities. Enron has long pushed the PSC to address this issue. The PSC wants 
unbundled rates in effect by the first half of 2002, and has set up a 
two-stage process to get there. Under the first stage, which the PSC wants 
completed and brought to them for decision by this August, major policy 
issues of statewide import  are to be considered. Resolution of these issues 
will guide the actual embedded cost studies which each of the utilities are 
directed to perform. These cost studies and the fully unbundled rates that 
will flow from them, will then be reviewed in utility-specific cases. The PSC 
expects the studies to be completed before the end of this year.  I 
anticipate that we will actively participate in this proceeding, which is

p.m. at the home of Judy and Jack Holmes in River Oaks, followed by a dinner 
at 7 for approximately 20 people at a location to be determined. Governor 
Perry will be attending the reception, but not the dinner. All proceeds from 
the fundraiser will go to the Pataki campaign. Tickets to the dinner are 
$5,000.00 per person.

When I spoke with Blakemore last week, she indicated that the event was being 
chaired by Bill Wise from El Paso, but she was willing to figure out a way to 
get Ken or Jeff equal billing. She indicated that they do not yet have a 
location for the dinner and suggested that it might be hosted in Ken or 
Jeff's home. She also suggested that if we were willing to commit to $25,000, 
we should be given co-chair status and would check with Pataki's office to 
confirm that. I spoke with Blakemore today (5/11) and she confirmed that we 
would definitely be given co-chair status for a $25k contribution. (She noted 
that there may in fact be one or two others as well.) 

I recommend that we co-host the event. As Rick correctly noted, we don't have 
much of a relationship with Pataki, and this would give us a chance to begin 
to establish closer ties with him. As you may be aware, NY law limits 
corporate donations to NY candidates in any one year to $5,000.00 in the 
aggregate. However, every individual corporation is allowed to make a 
separate $5,000.00 contribution.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""twea=
ks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

on to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams iss=

In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, Edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward.
It remains unclear whether Edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.).  
So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.
Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.
Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.

  I'm sending you an attachment of a manual that I have in progress that I think may be a useful tool for Settlements in order to help the Settlement Coordinators in their research before they enter a dispute into DMS.

  I believe that by following this outline, the coordinators can easily find information that will help to settle a dispute and I hope that we can eliminate 10% of the total number of disputes entered each month.  

  Please look over what I have put together and provide me with any feedback or additions that you might have.  
  
  I hope to have this document ready for implementation by next Friday 5-18-01.

are such a rotten ""bik"" that you didn't invite me. What's up with that?

My advice on the Outward Bound thing is to hold off. Not for selfish, 
wine-swilling reasons, of course; but because I know how tiring it gets to be 
living out of a suitcase with no dinero for a period of time. I have to say 
that sticking around Portland for the last six months has given me a renewed 
sense of mental health. Granted, I'm not totally sane yet, but at least I can 
imagine what it would be like. If you came home and turned right around and 
went to Colorado, you'd feel unprepared and maybe a little overwhelmed. Think 
carefully about how much Outward Bound would pay you in comparison with how 
much money you actually need to get by. Then add $500/month to that figure, 
and you'll be about right. It always sounds easier than the reality - I'm 
only speaking from Maui experience here. 

If you want to do a whirlwind Denver thing and have a great, rustic, totally 
broke time, then totally go for it. But if you feel like you're getting to 
the end of your rope with scraping by and feeling unsettled - which it kind 
of sounds like you are - then hang in P-town for awhile. Like I said, I'd 
feel SOOOO much better about taking off on my next adventure NOW than I would 
have even a couple months ago. And it's only been six months since I got back 
- that's not really too long to wait. In the meantime, you don't have to live 
with mom. The Malachowsky's room will be open, although for all the help I've 
given them I wouldn't be surprised if they don't want a Symes there anymore. 
Then there's always my future apartment. I'm thinkin' downtown for sure.

Anyway, we'll talk more about it in Mexico. Don't stress - whatever you're 
meant to do, you'll end up doing whether you like it or not.

1037,"Thanks for the feedback on the ISDA I got from Alan and Shari. I perhaps did 
not put the suggested changes in the ISDA Schedule in their full context. 
Recently we have received 2 ISDAs which included provisions that incorporate 
by reference Australian Addendum that relate to FX, currency and interest 
products and the like. Normally we only reference the Addenda that relate to 
electricity and commodities. The ralionale for seeking of this alternative 
ISDA form was to allow us the discretion have these provisions remain whilst 
following an agreed Enron trading form. Whilst EAPL is not authorised to 
trade these products we would have the flexibility to do so if the situation 
were to change in the future.  By way of comparison we include provisions to 
allow trading in respect of non-electricity commodities but do not do so.

Anyway as Shari and I discussed perhaps it is better that we drop the 
amendments to produce an alternative Australia ISDA with a broader scope.  l

1038,"Although we didn't get to discuss this at our credit luncheon, particularly 
we some of the less-experienced credit folks, when we receive a worksheet 
from them where the counterparty is a limited partnership, it may be 
advisable to ask them the following questions:

1. Should the GP be designated as a Specified Entity?  The alternative may be 
to require the GP to sign a Guaranty and then they would become a credit 
support provider.  By making the GP a Specified Entity, they get picked up in 
the cross default, bankruptcy and credit event upon merger provisions.

2. Should there be an additional termination event or event of default that 
gets triggered if the GP fails to be the GP of the limited partnership?

3. Whose financials are they expecting to receive, the GP's or the LP's?

4. If there are financial tests, who do they pertain to, the GP or the LP?

5. How does the LP qualify as an ESP?  Particularly with some of the less 
experienced credit folks who have not had to deal with this issue on the 
physical side, maybe this question should always be asked for every 
counterparty just to be safe.

I have had the following responses on the issues we discussed earlier:

I spoke with David Minns re the 'Eligible Persons' criteria, and he noted 
that while he had discussed the capital/asset holding criteria with Tana, he 
had not provided to anyone the other criteria, and that while these may be 
covered by the US criteria, there will need to be a review of all criteria 
before we can assess that all are covered. 
I spoke with Chris Catt at Price Waterhouse Coopers and he confirmed that 
provided there is no interest component in the cross border settlements made, 
there will be no with-holding tax issues re the payments/receipts. I am going 
to meet with Chris on Monday to discuss both the taxation implications and to 
review the GTC.

On the settlement issue, in the short term the best way to do the settlements 
for non-NEMMCO members would be via wires from Houston (this is how we 
settled our one previous cross border transaction) as this gives a third 
party review of the payments prior to release.

only the current year, but also for every previous year.
The State Bar of Texas is the first bar organization in
the United States to provide this ""full view"" of MCLE
compliance information via the Internet.  This secure
access service is accessible only by using the PIN that
will be assigned to you when you register online.

Accessing the MCLE Services To use these online MCLE
services, go to: http://www.texasbar.com
and click on ""TexasBar Online.""  This will take you to
the ""TexasBar Online - Services Menu,"" which provides
access to the MCLE Compliance Review, Course Search,
and Application for Accreditation.

The first time you go to the Compliance Review service,
you will need to register online.  Immediately after
completing the simple registration form, you will be
able to view your MCLE compliance record.

Almost immediately, you will receive an e-mail message
which contains your PIN for use during each future visit
to the Compliance Review service.  Make a note of your
PIN and keep it in a secure place.If you should lose or
forget your PIN, simply go through the online registration
process again.  A new PIN will be assigned to you.

Of course, you may continue to get MCLE information by
calling 800/204-2222, ext. 2106.

In addition to the new MCLE features, we thought you might
like to know that the State Bar web site will be undergoing
a major renovation this spring.  Please visit:
http://www.texasbar.com
often to see what's new.

We hope you will find the MCLE features on our web site to
be helpful and we welcome your comments about them.

Nice to hear that the register.com deal is going through.  Again, here are 
the domains that we need for EnronOnline.  (So, enrononline.co.jp, 
enrononline.com.sg, etc.)

As I mentioned to you, let's try to get all of the unrestricted domains 
immediately and all of the information fro the restricted domains as soon as 
possible.  The first tier is of course a higher priority, but I recognize 
that we may be able to get some of the second tier domains faster, if they 
are unrestricted.

As you contact register.com, you should tell them that we want all restricted 
domains ASAP and that we want all of the information and materials necessary 
to register the unrestricted domains.  As a precaution, I would tell them 
that they should not register unrestricted domains for us without our consent 
(Dave Forster's approval), simply because, as in the case of Japan, we don't 
want to take another Enron business unit's one domain, if the country's rule 
is 'one domain name per company'.  (Presumably they wouldn't be able to do 
that any way, because we'd have to provide them with that information, but 
just in case!)

For now (unless Dave Forster objects), let's use my London RC code (because 
as the deal stands, it's an Enron Europe company signing the contract with 
register.com).  It is RC 100487.

Thank you very much Felipe!

One of the current priorities of  Casino Willamette  is our Services Desk, a 
relatively new concept whereby we supposedly do a bunch of California 
scheduling coordination services for customers who are too unsophisticated to 
deal with California complexity,  earn a reasonable little fee and, here is 
the kicker,  the whole enterprise is seen as involving ""very little risk.""  
It is seen as picking up a fair bit of change off the floor with no risk,   
as though a slot machine broke and a bunch of quarters rolled around on the 
floor and all we have to do is scrape them up.  Not big money, but safe 
money.  ""Pays the overhead,"" one often hears traders remark.  

I have drafted a series of confirms over last year to document a variety of 
transactions and am in the process of reviewing them with an eye to constant 
improvement.  I am having a series of discussions with traders, schedulers 
and settlement folks and one risk that keeps coming up in their minds, which 
I am not really sure I have covered in our documents is referred to as 
""system outage risk.""   Interaction with the Cal PX and the California ISO is 
all online electronic.  Scheduling power into the California market is all an 
online business.  So let us say that one bright spring morning we have agreed 
with our 17 SC customers to schedule a variety of power products into and out 
of the California system, and right at the critical moment when all of this 
scheduling stuff is supposed to click, the whole damn system collapses?  
Apparently we have a bunch of system apparatus that is our own,  that is, it 
is not just our link up to the California entities.  One time our  tie line 
got cut (middle of night, no problem because they got it fixed in time)  Is 
this kind of internal system breakdown an event of force majeure,  or is it a 
default on our part?  I have been reading our eol agreements, in particular, 
the ETA and am not sure how to address it.  Is it appropriate in the new age 
electronic commerce world for a party providing electronically based  
services to just tell everybody that if our system goes down we are not 
liable and by the way, if it causes a bunch of costs to come flowing back 
from the ISO,  the other poor guy has to pay them?  I would appreciate your 
thoughts, based on your eol experience.  ",Mark,,the Cal PX SC ETA ISO

I haven't had a chance to plunge into the book you lent  me at the conference 
because I am flailing around wildly in  as much as I can about certain 
Spanish topics before early July, including such things as, of course,   
Cervantes, a man whose mind I have come to love almost as much as 
Shakespeare's, the  Catalans,  the Spanish Civil War, the War of Spanish 
Succession, the Spanish Inquisition and of course the Spanish Aramada.  I 
have never read a definitive account of that great moment in English naval 
history.  Did Nelson fight in the Armada battle at Trafalgar? Is that the 
battle Jack Aubrey is always talking about?     Where the hell is Trafalgar?  
I have the idea it is down there by Gibraltar but can't find it on the map.  
On the other hand, I have a vague fantasy of these little row boats coming 
out at the mouth of the Thames to battle the mighty Armada.   When one 
considers  what the panic must have been like in the Spanish fleet when they 
realized that in spite of their size and assumed invincibility they were 
actually vulnerable to that old maritime risk of sinking, one is 
involuntarily  caused to cast one's badly  jaundiced commercial-legal  mind 
upon  recent events of an analagous nature on board our own beloved ship,  
sailing as it has been  in the northern  commercial straits.   Has our  
mighty Armada sailed out onto the seas of deregulation, only to meet the 
......   perhaps I shall cease articulating  this line of thought and dwell 
upon the ingenuity of the Engish.   

Anyway,  I have come to a point here in Portland  where I need to go back 
into the policy context of our trading business.  I recall in Houston that  
we had these trading policies that you worked on and that they set limits and 
articulated responsibilities.  Do you still have close contact with those 
policies and if so, is there a discrete document that pertains to the 
Portland desk and if so would you be so kind as to send me a hard copy of 
it?  I want to ground myself again in the fundamentals so my daily battles 
can be a little more fun.  --cgy

1098,"Over the last several years, we've received numerous questions and candid 
comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our eSpeak 
sessions and through the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and 
voicemail.  While eSpeak is an open, informal chat between employees and 
management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are 
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose 
anonymity.  We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your 
thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond 
to your questions and concerns.  This is the kind of work environment we all 
must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us 
comments about the things that are important to you.

Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us 
anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions.  We now have a 
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality.  In the future, when 
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the 
question and our response will be posted on eMeet.  This will allow us to 
answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an 
opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is 
an open discussion board.

Remember:  You can send your questions and comments to us in two ways:
 - email to Office of the Chairman, or
 - Office of the Chairman voicemail box at 713-853-7294, which is a 
confidential call

Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our Vision and 
Values and absolutely vital to our continued success as a company.  So don't 
be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind.  We want to hear from you.",,,the Office of the eSpeak Enron eMeet Office of the Chairman

At the very least, we are going to position ourselves with El Paso such that we can have a commercial discussion.

1102,"Steph, further to our discussion, Pls review.  I took a quick look at the locations and most appear to be East based.  You might want to use an analyst to figure this out. Also, they have valued the inventories off of the Nymex only ( or so it appears) and I would have to believe that the value of these molecules is materially different than this. 

Pls review and let's discuss asap.

As we discussed, here is the Del. Pt. language for sales at NP and SP15.  For 
any sale beyond April 2002 (not purchases), we might want to use this 
language, but only if the trader requests it in a note on the deal entry.  If 
the trader does not request it, it is our understanding that you will try to 
catch it and notify us to make sure the new language is not desired by the 
trader (Use me as a contact and I will ask the trader).  It is understood, 
however, that if the trader does not request the language and you do not 
catch it the trader bears the risk.
