 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

",44,the State Bank
12,"George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

20,"Gentlemen,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

Enjoyed meeting with you.  

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.

38,"The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separate 
unique deal.  An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November 
8th, 2000.  It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and 
Q86409.4.  These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore 
count as a total of four deals.     

We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as 
just one large deal with 4 different parts.  Unfortunately,  the EOL 
Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals 
are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.  Since this 
currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most 
conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.  This results 
in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.

68,"Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

any objections, I will pick the draft order here at work under the scrutinhy

starting lineups will include 1QB, 2 RBs, 3 WRs, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 Def.

80,"Hi Folks,

As we head into your FF Playoffs, weather is a real factor in many games.
Knowing how it will affect your players can be huge.  With that in mind, I'm
pleased to introduce our Weather Guru, Mike McVay.  Mike's a Meteorologist
with WOWK - TV in West Virginia.  He also happens to be a very successful
Fantasy Football Fanatic.  What a deal.  Not unlike when I call on my
Physician friends for injury advice, Mike will offer his expert insights to
give you a sneak peek at how the weather may affect key games.

I'll see you early Thursday morning with our Matchups to Avoid and Exploit
and Players in the News.  In the meantime, here's an early look at some
developing weather situations that could affect your players this weekend.
Thanks Mike!

92,"Quarterbacks in the  News:

QB Jake Plummer (Ari) should get the start although he is  still hurting a 
tad with thumb and rib injuries.? He is listed as probable  on the injury 
report.? His backup Dave Brown is questionable with a  shoulder injury.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Jake Plummer  (Ari) looks to start with the sore ribs 
but understand that one good  shot could send him out of the game a la 
Charlie Batch Thursday night.? Be  careful here.

QB Doug Johnson (Atl) has been named the starter for the rest of the  season.
 

QB Trent Dilfer (Bal) is on a bye this week.

QB Rob Johnson  (Buf) is expected to start with sore ribs.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is making  excellent progress, but he will likely miss 
again this week.? Shane  Matthews is expected to get the start this week.? 
Cade is listed as  questionable with a sore shoulder.? He would probably play 
if Matthews were  to get hurt.

QB Scott Mitchell (Cin) is expected to return as the starter  despite a sore 
knee.? He practiced on Wednesday.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Scott Mitchell  (Cin)?looked good again in practice 
Friday and is now  probable.? He'll likely get the start which is good news 
for his  teammates.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) did not throw on Wednesday as he nurses  his ribs.? 
The team has not yet named a starter and if he can not go will  look to 
Spergon Wynn to lead there team into the slaughter.? Either way,  look for 
Jacksonville's defense to look good in this contest.
?
*** Saturday Update? Cleveland QBs.? Coach Chris  Palmer will reportedly wait 
until gametime to decide between QBs Doug Pederson  and Spergon Wynn.? What a 
choice.? I'm fairly confident you're not  starting either if you're with me 
still in week 14...

QB Clint Stoerner  was signed by Dallas this week.

QB Brian Griese (Den) is slated to return  the last week of the NFL season at 
the earliest.? Gus Frerotte will start  in his absence.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) was able to practice Tuesday and  is expected to take 
the field with his sore ribs.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC)  practiced on Wednesday, but is still questionable 
whether he will start.?  The coaching staff has yet to name a starter.? I 
rate his chances at 85% to  start.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Elvis Grbac (KC) has been  named the starter.? He 
says the finger feels fine and he's good to  go.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) was able to practice Wednesday and now looks  like he 
will start this Sunday.? He is listed as questionable on the injury  report 
with a sore shoulder and neck.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Jay Fielder (Mia) has looked good  (or at least as 
good as he ever looks) in practice and looks to start  Sunday.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) continues to take a pounding.? He  appears as 
questionable on the injury report again with a? sore thumb and a  bruised 
ego.? He missed practice on Tuesday, but typically plays  hurt.? If he can 
not go, look for John Friesz (and his less than 100% knee)  to take the field.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) practiced again  Friday and looks to 
be ok.? I doubt he'll be 100% for the rest of the  season but he's apparently 
able to manage the pain and limitation from the  thumb.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) is turning quite a few heads with his stellar  play.?? 
He starts again this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Aaron Brooks (NO) has a shot  at unseating Jeff Blake 
for the 2001 starter in New Orleans according to ESPN's  Chris Mortensen.? So 
besides the obvious playoff situation, he's playing  for stakes that extend 
past this season.? 

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit)  is probable with a sore calf, but expects to 
start.? 

QB Jerome  Bettis (Pit) has a sore leg, but it will take a lot more than that 
to keep him  off the field.

QB Moses Moreno (SD) needs to trade away a commandment or  two for a more 
durable body.? He appears on the injured list again as  questionable with a 
sore knee.? Ryan Leaf, who has a sore groin,? will  start again in his place.

QB Jon Kitna (Sea) gets the start this week for  the injured Brock Huard.? 
Brock is out indefinitely with a bruised kidney  and was just released from 
the hospital earlier this week.

QB Kurt Warner  (StL) took snaps and has looked great throwing in practice.? 
He will start  this week.? Trent Green will back him up.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Kurt Warner (StL) will likely be  playing on a less 
than optimal field in Carolina Sunday.? Besides the  grass, they're looking 
at possible snow.

QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on  Wednesday and looks to start against the 
Cowboys.? Eric Zeier would play if  Shaun king suffered a set-back.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on  Wednesday and looks to start this week.? 
He is listed as questionable on  the injury report with a hurt thumb.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is back behind  center while Jeff George watches.? I 
doubt we have seen the last of this  controversy.

////////////////////////////////

Running  backs in the News:
*** Saturday Update? RB Thomas Jones (Ari) has been  deactivated for this 
week's game as he's still recovering from  pneumonia.??? More work for 
Michael Pittman.

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo (Bal) is gone for the season.

RB Jamal  Lewis (Bal) is on a bye this week.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf) was able to  practice briefly on Wednesday and is 
questionable for this week's game.? He  is having troublemaking the hard cuts 
so will likely be ineffective even if he  plays.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Sammy Morris (Buf) isn't looking  much better as we 
near kickoff.? I'm not expecting much of anything from  him this week.

RB William Floyd (Car) will miss this game.

RB  Tshimanga?Biakabutuka (Car) likely returns to the lineup this week. He 
is  listed as probable with a sore toe.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) had a  setback this week 
and has been deactivated for Sunday's game.? Look for RB  Brad Hoover to get 
another start.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Corey Dillon (Cin)? QB Scott  Mitchell (Cin)?looked 
good again in practice Friday and is now  probable.? He'll likely get the 
start which is good news for his  teammates.
*** Saturday Update FB Nick Williams (Cin) ?likely  starts for Clif Groce 
Sunday.

RB Jamel White (Cle) is banged up with a sore shoulder.? Look for  Travis 
Prentice to ""shoulder"" more of the load this week.

RB Emmitt Smith  (Dal) has shaken off the concussion and will start this week.

RB Terrell  Davis (Den) is out this week with calf problems.? Mike Anderson 
gets the  start again this week.

RB Detron Smith (Den) can play if needed with his  sore thumb.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) misses yet another game.? Ahman  Green will get the 
start.

RB Lamar Smith (Mia) practiced on Wednesday and  is expected to be the 
starter despite being listed as questionable on the injury  report with a 
tender hamstring.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Lamar Smith (Mia) continues to look  good in practice 
and should be good to go.

RB Jimmy Kleinsasser (Min) is  probable with a sore hamstring.

RB JR Redmond (NE) appears as  questionable on the injury report with bruised 
ribs, but he expects to  play.

RB Ricky Williams (NO) is healing way ahead of schedule.? He  may now be 
ready for the last game of the regular season.? His cast is  expected to come 
off later this week.

RB Jerald Moore (NO) is listed as  questionable on the injury report with a 
sore neck.? He is still expected  to start though, but Chad Morton may see a 
few more reps than usual.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Jerald Moore (NO) was upgraded to  probably after a 
good practice Thursday and looks to start.

RB Curtis  Martin (NYJ) plans on playing through the pain.? He is listed as 
probable  with a sore gluteus.? I am guessing he is the butt of many New 
York  jokes.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) apparently is  better with a week 
to heal and should be able to make a bigger contribution this  week.? 

RB Leon Johnson has been re-signed by the Jets and will  return punts.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is banged up with a sore knee and  finger, but his 
ankles are better.? He will play this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Napoleon Kaufman (Oak)  tweaked his hamstring 
Thursday and is?was listed as questionable.? He  did do some work Saturday 
and looks improved. If he is limited,  this?increases the workload Wheatley 
will see and could open the door for  newly signed Terry Kirby.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this  week and he is using the time to 
look for personalized items with his last  name.? We will keep you posted.

RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as  questionable with a sore hamstring.? On a 
team that already has a crowded  backfield with Jermaine Fazande and Terrell 
Fletcher, Kenny looks like he could  be placed on the inactive list this week.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) has a  broken rib, but is expected to play with the 
pain.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) practiced  again Friday and 
looks to start Sunday.

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) is listed  as questionable on the injury report, but 
is doubtful he would have played  anyway.? The team remains cautious in his 
comeback.

RB Mike Alstott  (TB) will not play this week.? Look for Warrick Dunn to get 
plenty of  opportunities against a soft Dallas defense.

RB Eddie George (Ten)  skipped Wednesday's practice, but expects to practice 
today and play this  weekend.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Eddie George (Ten) looked good in  practice Friday and 
will start.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is listed as  questionable with a sore knee.

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will play with his  sore forearm.? Look for the Giants 
to attempt to arm-tackle him all day.  
*** Saturday Update RB Stephen Davis (Was) certainly  sounds like he's sure 
to play this week.? Although it has to be noted he  sounded like that last 
week.? While I feel pretty good that he'll play, the  worry here is one good 
shot to the arm could really have an effect.? 

///////////////////////////////////

Wide Receivers in  the News:

WR Frank Sanders (Ari) is expected to play with a sore  leg.

WR Brian Finneran (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to  play with 
a sore back.

WR Qadry Ismail (Bal) is on a bye this  week.

WR Jermaine Lewis (Bal) will use this week to heal his shoulder he  injured 
in last week's game.

WR Peerless Price (Buf) is expected to play  with a sore ankle.

WR Donald Hayes (Car) is expected to start with a sore  groin.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Donald Hayes (Car)?was able to  practice Friday and is 
still looking like a go for Sunday.? Watch for the  snow however.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Marcus Robinson (Chi) was  released from the hospital 
after spending a few days keeping an eye on his  back.? He's been downgraded 
to doubtful and I'm really not looking for  anything from this weekend.? He'd 
been struggling with QB Shane Matthews  anyway.? I'd look elsewhere if you 
can.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Marty Booker (Chi) looks to see  more playing time 
with Robinson's back troubles.?
?
*** Saturday Update?WR Peter Warrick  (Cin)?? QB Scott Mitchell (Cin)?looked 
good again in  practice Friday and is now probable.? He'll likely get the 
start which is  good news for his teammates.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle) is listed as  questionable with a sore knee.? He 
did not practice on Wednesday.

WR  Germane Crowell (Det) is out again this week.? Johnnie Morton and Herman  
Moore will start in his absence.

WR Corey Bradford (GB) has spent more  time on the injury report than Yancey 
Thigpen...well maybe not, but he can't  stay healthy either.? Corey misses 
another game this week as he is  officially listed as out.

WR EG Green (Ind) still has a sprained knee and  is listed as questionable on 
the injury report.? He says he will be ready  to play though.
?
*** Saturday Update WR E.G. Green (Ind) did not improve  this week and has 
been deactivated.

WR OJ McDuffie (Mia) is questionable  with a sore toe.? With Tony Martin now 
healthy, the team will likely rest  OJ so that he can heal for the playoffs.

WR Troy Brown (NE) is listed as  questionable on the injury report with a 
sore leg, but he expects to play.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Troy Brown (NE) ?was able to  do some work Saturday 
but still isn't 100%.? He'll probably be the # 3 WR  if he can go Monday.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out in likely more ways than  his listing on the injury 
report.? Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are playing  good enough to hold onto 
the starting jobs even if Jake were to get  healthy.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) is out with a bruised sternum.? Joe  Jurevicius will 
start in his place.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) gets the start  over Laveranues Coles who is out with a 
twisted knee.

WR Courtney Hawkins  (Pit) is questionable this week with a sore knee, but 
even if he played he would  likely be ineffective.? Hines Ward has been the 
only Pittsburgh receiver to  do anything consistently all year.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) is not a lock to  play, but he keeps talking like he 
will be on the field though.? He was  quoted in the Sacramento Bee as saying 
he is 85% right now.? I am guessing  he is closer to 70%, but he probably 
will play if he can handle the pain from  his turf toe.
*** Saturday Update WR Terrell Owens (SF) missed practice  again Friday and 
looks like he'll be the # 3 WR behind Jerry Rice and J.J.  Stokes.? It's 
tough not to start him as he's always got the potential to  explode but he's 
a big risk.? If you need sure points this week, I'd shy  away from him.? If 
you really need help and you're looking for a home run,  you might take a 
chance on him but just be prepared for the chance he does  little.
?
*** Saturday Update? St. Louis WRs?will likely  be playing on a less than 
optimal field in Carolina Sunday.? Besides the  grass, they're looking at 
possible snow.

WR Tony Horne (Stl) is out this week with a toe injury.

WR  Az-Zahir Hakim (Stl) is expected to play with his sore knee this week.

WR  Carl Pickens (Ten) continues to miss time with a sore hamstring.? Even 
if  he plays, he does not look like he will be a big factor.

WR Albert  Connell (Was) got a break when the doctors upgraded his 
condition.? He  remains sore though and may be a game-time decision to 
whether he plays.?  The team is starting James Thrash and Irving Fryar so he 
may have limited value  even if he suits up this week.

WR James Thrash (Was) has a bruised thigh,  but is expected to play this 
week.?  

///////////////////////////////

Tight Ends in the  News:

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is  expected to play with a 
sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) looked good in  practice later this 
week and will likely get the start.

TE Shannon Sharpe  (Bal) is on a bye this week.

TE OJ Santiago (Cle) is bothered by a sore  knee.? Fantasy players are 
bothered that he is still mentioned as a player  in the NFL.

TE Aaron Shea (Cle) is listed as questionable with sore  quadriceps.? He was 
limited in practice, but expects to play in the  game.

TE Jackie Harris (Dal) was quoted as saying he will play this  weekend.? He 
is expected to practice on Thursday and is listed as  questionable on the 
injury report with a sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update TE Jackie Harris (Dal) did practice  and looks good for 
Sunday.

TE Tony Gonzalez (KC) is perfectly fine and  just did not catch a pass last 
week from 6 attempts from Warren Moon.? If  Grbac plays, expect him to get 
the ball to Tony again.

TE Hunter Goodwin  (Mia) has a tight hamstring, but is expected to play. 

TE Johnny  McWilliams (Min) is now the starter.? John Davis still gets a lot 
of looks  though.

TE Chad Lewis (Phi) is expected to play with a sore elbow.  

///////////////////////////////

Kickers in the  News:

PK David Akers (Phi) is expected to play with a pulled  quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (Stl) looks like he will kick this week.? But  he has looked 
like he was ready before and then gave way to Jeff Hall minutes  before 
game-time.? Now that the Rams are tied for first though, expect the  players 
to start working through the pain.? I rate Wilkins chance to start  at close 
to 90% this week.

Davis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play
Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.
According to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack
in Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the
Redskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the
injury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point
at which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.
""It hurts now,"" Davis said. ""It's something I have to overcome. They told me
it's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.
[But] I'm hopeful.""
Davis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But
Tyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent
another yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for
85 yards on 19 carries.
""It didn't affect me at all,"" he said. ""We ran the ball a couple times after
it happened and did okay.""
Skip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the
Eagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on
the inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is
sidelined or limited.
The Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive
starters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,
center Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's
third-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with
10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.
Turner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to
the ball. ""That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury,"" Turner
said. ""Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it.""

My View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's
going to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes
anyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll
see Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on
it, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the
Eagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing
allowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the
""tough guy"" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played
Monday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he
played with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about ""leaders stepping
up"" and such.  Stephen Davis' injury appears to be primarily an issue of
managing the pain and I'd be very surprised to see him sit after Green's
performance.
Thanks to my friend J.D. Gardner for his help on this one.

 Latest NBA Player News 

 Jake Voskuhl , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Voskuhl was placed on the injured list by Chicago with a right hip flexor 
strain today. One of the Bulls second-round picks in the June draft, Voskuhl 
was averaging 1.3 points and 1.5 rebounds in four games this season.  

 Dalibor Bagaric , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Bulls today activated Bagaric, the 24th pick overall in the June draft. 
He had missed Chicago's first 10 games with a bruised right knee. Bagaric 
averaged 18.3 points and 10.4 rebounds for Benston Zagreb of the Croatian 
League last year.  

 Randy Livingston , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Warriors waived Livingston today, less than one week after signing him 
as a free agent. He had appeared in only two games and was expendable with 
the return of Bob Sura from injury.  

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Warriors activated Sura from the injured list today. He had been 
sidelined all season with a lower back injury suffered during training camp. 
The 27-year-old was acquired in June from Cleveland via Milwaukee in a 
three-team deal, after he had posted a career-high 13.8 point-per-game 
average with the Cavaliers.  

 Bruno Sundov , C IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Pacers activated Sundov from the injured list after placing Tyus Edney 
on the same list today. The 20-year-old center had been sidelined all season 
with a sprained left ankle.  

 Tyus Edney , G IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Pacers placed Edney on the injured list today with plantar fasciatis in 
his left foot. The 5-10, 152-pound center will miss a minimum of five games. 
He was averaging 3.4 points and 1.9 assists in eight games this season.  

 Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Thorpe received a cortisone shot in his ailing left foot, and he will be 
sidelined another four weeks. He was placed on the injured list on Thursday 
after averaging 3.0 points and 1.7 rebounds in six games.  

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/21/00 
 Camby had an MRI during Sunday's game which confirmed that he only has a 
sprained ankle.  He turned the ankle in Friday night's win over Phoenix.  He 
is listed as day to day, and it is unclear whether he will begin playing 
tonight or tomorrow. Camby has been the best center in the Eastern Confernece 
thus far, so make sure to start him as soon as he returns to the lineup.    

 Terrell Brandon , G MIN - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 Brandon, who has missed four games with an ankle sprain, practiced for the 
first time on Monday since being hurt on Nov. 9.  He said he might return to 
the lineup when the Timberwolves host the Vancouver Grizzlies on Wednesday 
night.     

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 After initially expecting a return to the court tonight against Cleveland, 
it seems that Jones will miss at least tonight's game - and likely more. ""The 
doctor told me flat out,"" Jones said, ""it's going to be awhile.""  Jones tried 
to participate in drills yesterday, but his injured calf continued to tighten 
on him.  If Jones is on your roster, it's a good idea to keep him on the 
bench until his prognosis is a bit more clear.    

 Dirk Nowitzki , F DAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/21/00 
 Nowitzki re-aggravated a left shoulder injury in the third quarter of Monday 
night's game against the Jazz.  He left the game and did not return, but did 
post 20 points and 14 rebounds before exiting.  He is not expected to miss 
any time because of the injury.  Nowitzki is establishing himself as a real 
Fantasy star, so continue to start him as long as his shoulder holds up.    

 Rex Chapman , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Chapman announced his retirement Monday because of a series of injuries.  He 
underwent surgery on his right wrist before training camp and began the 
season on the injured list.  Chapman is also scheduled to have ankle surgery 
soon.     

 Todd Day , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Day was activated from the injured list Friday.  Guard Sam Jacobsen was 
placed on the list to make room for Day.  Day was a key reserve for the Suns 
in 1999-2000 but was sidelined for the first few weeks this season due to a 
knee injury.  He will be a valuable reserve for the T'Wolves as well but 
won't help a Fantasy team too much.     

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Skinner was placed on the injured list after hurting his ankle.  Zendon 
Hamilton was activated to replace Skinner on the roster.  Skinner has been 
somewhat of a disappointment this season averaging 5.8 points and 4.7 
rebounds per game.     

 Jeff McInnis , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 McInnis is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nets after 
suffering a bruised knee against the Sonics Saturday.  Rookie Keyon Dooling 
is expected to get his first start at point guard for the Clippers.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Williams played 26 minutes in Saturday's game against the Suns, scoring four 
points and grabbing seven rebounds.  He had missed Thursday's game against 
the Hornets because of a hip and groin injuries.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Del Negro played eight minutes in Sunday's loss to the Knicks.  He had 
missed the Warriors previous two games due to a sprained ankle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Buckner re-injured his right foot and is expected to be sidelined for at 
least a week.  Hubert Davis is expected to start at shooting guard in his 
absence.    

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Dickerson is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nuggets due 
to a sprained ankle.  Look for veteran Kevin Edwards to start at shooting 
guard in his place.    

 Doug West , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 West's strained right shoulder has healed and head coach Sidney Lowe is 
expected to activate him from the injured list this week.  Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 
is expected to be placed on the injured list to make room for West.  

 Shareef Abdur-Rahim , F VAN - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/20/00 
 Abdur-Rahim is expected to play in Monday's game against Vancouver.  He 
missed Saturday's game to be with his sick mother in Atlanta.  If he doesn't 
make it back to Vancouver in time rookie Stromile Swift could get a rare 
start at small forward.    

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 MacCulloch was placed on the injured list Monday with an ankle injury.  With 
the return of Matt Geiger, MacCulloch's already low Fantasy value diminishes 
even further.     

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/20/00 
 Geiger has been activated off the injured list, and could see some playing 
time in tonight's game in Boston.  With Geiger's return, the Sixers placed 
center Todd McCulloch on the injured list.  If you have Geiger on your 
Fantasy roster, give him some time to get back into game shape before putting 
him in your starting lineup.    

 Tim Thomas , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Thomas disclosed on Saturday that he is having some real discomfort in his 
left knee, and it is getting worse with each game that he plays. Thomas has 
started off slow, but didn't want to use the injury as an excuse.  ""It's very 
painful at times,"" said Thomas. ""The only thing I can do is keep getting rest 
as much as possible.""  The Bucks can ill-afford to lose Thomas; they have 
already lost starting forward Darvin Ham and backup forward Scott Williams 
this season.  If Thomas is on your Fantasy squad, it might be a good idea to 
keep in on the bench until his condition improves.      

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Jones has missed three straight games with a right calf sprain, but says 
that he expects to play on Wednesday night against Cleveland. Jones has 
averaged 16.9 points through his first seven games in Miami.     

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/20/00 
 Rose his hoping to make his season debut on Tuesday night against the 
Rockets, but he's not making any promises.  He was suppose to return to 
action last week, but the team's medical personnel advised him to wait a bit 
longer before hitting the court.  If Rose is on your roster, give him at 
least another week before putting him into your starting lineup.    

 Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 The Detroit Pistons announced on Monday morning that they had come to terms 
with Smith, on what is believed to be a one-year deal for the NBA's mid-level 
exception of $2.25 million (pro-rated after 11 games).  Smith had reportedly  
agreed to re-sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum 
of $611,000 last week.  He will eventually be the Pistons starting center but 
will probably spend the next few weeks inmproving his conditioning.  There is 
no need to rush and try to acquire Smith.  He has been a solid reserve 
at-best throughout his career.  If you have him on your Fantasy team wait 
awhile before you insert him into your lineup.     

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/20/00 
 Camby turned his ankle during Friday night's victory in Phoenix. X-rays 
taken on his ankle were negative, then Camby underwent an MRI as a 
precautionary measure. He missed Sunday night's game against the Warriors, 
and is listed as day to day.       

 Tim Hardaway , G MIA - The Old School Fools Updated 11/19/00 
 Hardaway, plagued by knee ailments for the past two seasons, sat out 
Saturday night's game against the Portland Trail Blazers with tendinitis in 
his right knee. Hardaway said he expects to play in Miami's next game 
Wednesday against Cleveland.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00 
 O'Neal, bothered by a sprained left ankle and a sore Achilles' tendon, was 
not in uniform Saturday night as the Los Angeles Lakers played the Denver 
Nuggets.  His status is day-to-day.  O'Neal said he was injured when someone 
fell on his leg in the first quarter of Thursday night's overtime victory at 
Sacramento. Greg Foster took O'Neal's place in the starting lineup.

107,"Hi Folks,

Our Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this week's Updgrades and
Downgrades.

Enjoy!

Joe

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Upgrades

QB - Aaron Brooks - Brooks and the Saints offense are clicking now and
Brooks' fantasy owners must be ecstatic.  Brooks has scored multiple
touchdowns in 3 of the last 4 weeks and I expect this trend to continue for
the remainder of the season.  With an easier schedule and better decision
making, Brooks has been able to connect with Aaron Brooks, Willie Jackson
and breakout tight end Boo Williams.

QB - Jeff Garcia - Garcia continues to put up exceptional numbers.  He has
thrown for 3 or more touchdowns in 5 of the last 6 games.  I wouldn't bench
Garcia in favor of any quarterback in the league right now.  He is a stud.

QB - Charlie Batch - Batch's 436 yard, 3 touchdown performance deserves
recognition.  However, I still think Batch will see bench time as the Lions
give backup Mike McMahon some playing time towards the end of the season for
the winless Lions.  A tough schedule remains for Batch and the Lions as
Green Bay, Chicago (2), Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh are left on the schedule.

QB - Rich Gannon - A strong performance on Sunday with 311 yards and 4
touchdowns proves Gannon and the Raiders offense is the team to beat in the
AFC.  With Tim Brown and Jerry Rice looking fantastic, Gannon will continue
to post good numbers for the remainder of the season.

QB - Kurt Warner - Warner looked good on Sunday night with 401 yards and 3
touchdowns.  More importantly, he did not appear to be hampered by a thumb
injury that has been nagging him throughout the season.  As always, keep
Warner in your starting lineup.

QB - Jake Plummer - Plummer looked good on Sunday with 334 passing yards and
4 touchdowns.  Keep in mind, this performance was against the hapless Lions.
Look for Plummer to return to his normal erratic self in the next two weeks
against San Diego and Oakland.  Plummer might be a good option for playoff
weeks as he faces Dallas in week 15 and Carolina in week 16.



RB - Shaun Alexander - Plain and simple, Alexander produces when he is in
the lineup.  He scored his 10th touchdown of the season on Sunday and nearly
cleared 100 yards once again.  Look for Alexander to remain the starter once
Watters returns from injury.

RB -  Duce Staley - Staley continues to look better and better.  The 133
total yards on Sunday will be a sign of things to come for Staley in the
second half of the season.  Philadelphia's offense and a rock solid defense
will keep the Eagles in the lead in the majority of games.  With Correll
Buckhalter in trouble with a team suspension due to marijuana, Staley will
not lose many carries to Buckhalter.

RB - Warrick Dunn - Dunn managed just 12 yards rushing against a solid Bears
defense, but a 12 catch, 138 yard receiving performance helps vault him into
the upgrades section.  More importantly, it appears that Dunn has returned
to 100% after being hampered by foot and hamstring injuries.

RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst nearly reached the 100-yard plateau once
again.  He has looked good the last few weeks and should continue this trend
for the remainder of the season.  The 49ers offense continues to look good
and a favorable schedule gives Hearst the advantage over a majority of
starting running backs in the league.

RB - Ricky Williams - The Saints offense is looking sharp and efficient.
With Brooks making wise decisions, the offense will continue to get better
and this will lead to more scoring opportunities for Williams.  Williams has
topped the 120 yard mark in consecutive weeks.  Look for this trend to
continue as the Saints have a favorable schedule in the second half of the
season.



WR - Marty Booker - The Bears finally starting passing the ball downfield
and Booker's statistics were directly affected.  He burned the Buccaneers
for 3 long touchdowns on the day and made it look rather easy.  Look for
more longer passes out of the Bears in the second half of the season.  With
teams starting to ""sell out"" to the run, Booker and Miller should connect on
some play action pass touchdowns.

WR - Joe Horn - Horn remains one of the hottest receivers in the league with
8 catches for 148 yards on Sunday.  With Aaron Brooks making wiser
decisions, the New Orleans offense has started putting touchdowns on the
board.  Although this may be bad news for John Carney owners, it is good
news for Horn, Ricky Williams, and Willie Jackson.

WR - Jerry Rice - With Tim Brown receiving the majority of attention from
defenses, Rice will continue to be effective on the other side of the field.
The career touchdown leader added 3 more to his total on Sunday and made it
look rather easy.  With the Oakland offense looking good, Rice should
continue to see scoring chances.  A good option for a 3rd wide receiver in
your lineup.

WR - Peerless Price - With 10 catches and 138 yards receiving on Sunday,
Price continues to outperform Eric Moulds in the Bills offense and have many
fantasy owners questioning who is the number one receiver in Buffalo.  With
Eric Moulds being shut down with double teams, Price has quietly scored 5
touchdowns on the season.  Price is a talented receiver and should continue
to score a touchdown every other week.

WR - Hines Ward - Ward has amassed 26 catches in his last 3 games. He has
only scored two touchdowns on the season, but his reception and yardage
numbers are becoming a consistent factor on a weekly basis.  I've never been
a big fan of the Steelers passing game, but Ward deserves consideration for
active duty on a weekly basis.

WR - David Boston - Boston's 100-yard game streak ended this week.  Fantasy
owners had to settle for 80 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns.  Look for
Boston to continue to put up quality numbers.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/



Downgrades


QB - Brian Griese - The ankle injury to Rod Smith had me worried a little
bit heading into Sunday's game, so I was not surprised by Griese's poor
performance on Sunday.  With Smith hobbled by injuries and McCaffrey out for
the year, Griese's receiving options were limited and his production was
directly affected.  You may want to consider benching Griese until Smith is
healthy.  However, the Broncos do play Dallas on Thanksgiving.

QB - Tim Couch - Couch threw 3 interceptions and was held to 144 passing
yards against a stingy Ravens defense.  Couch should be considered a quality
keeper quarterback, but the Browns schedule will make Couch an inconsistent
quarterback for the remainder of this season.  Couch should do well against
Cincinnati and Jacksonville, but struggle against New England, Green Bay and
Pittsburgh.

QB - Mark Brunell - An injured quad injury kept Brunell out of the lineup
this week.  With an unfavorable matchup against Baltimore this week, it may
be best to start someone else this week.

QB - Elvis Grbac - Grbac looked horrible with 4 interceptions on Sunday.
The week was not a total disappointment for Grbac as he threw 2 touchdown
passes. The schedule looks favorable for Grbac, but he is struggling, which
concerns me.

QB - Tony Banks - Banks suffered a concussion in Sunday's game against
Denver.  The injury looked severe as Banks was slammed to the ground and
then taken off the field on a stretcher.

QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler threw 3 interceptions and 2 touchdowns on Sunday.
Unfortunately, Fiedler's two touchdowns were scored by the Jets defense.
The up and down season for Fiedler continues.  With games against Buffalo,
Indianapolis and San Francisco left on the schedule, Fiedler should still be
considered a quality ""spot starter"".



RB - Eddie George - George was held to 61 yards on 23 carries Sunday.  He
has yet to break the 100-yard barrier in a game this season.  I guess the
toe injury in the preseason affected his performance more than most
anticipated.  Although we can blame the toe injury, two other factors have
meant the demise of George this season.  First, the loss of lead back
Lorenzo Neal has minimized running lanes.  Finally, the Titans offensive
line is not giving George the quality run blocking of the previous seasons.

RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held under 60 yards for the second
consecutive game.  With opposing defenses focusing on stopping the run,
Thomas will continue to find the running room a little tougher throughout
the remainder of the season.  Keep in mind, the Bears last two opponents
(Green Bay and Tampa Bay) are two of the better defenses against the run in
the league.  With Tampa Bay, Green Bay, Minnesota and Detroit (2) on the
schedule for the remainder of the season, expect Thomas' stats to be up and
down.

RB - Lamar Smith - With 53 rushing yards on 19 carries, Smith continues to
struggle.  This marks the 5th consecutive game that Smith has been held 3
yards/carry.  Don't be surprised if the Dolphins give Travis Minor a larger
role in the running game.

RB - Travis Henry - Henry continues to struggle.  He managed just 29 yards
on 13 carries this past Sunday and had a crucial fumble.  A running back can
not be productive with just 13 carries.  Keep him on your bench.



WR - Rod Smith - Suffering from an ankle injury, Smith was limited to 25
yards on three catches.  He did manage to score a touchdown.  Smith's ankle
injury deserved your attention.  The Broncos kept Smith on the sidelines
late in the 4th quarter while the team was attempting to drive down the
field and tie the ball game.  The short week will not help Smith's status on
Thanksgiving Day.

WR - Eric Moulds - The disappointing season for Moulds continues.  He was
held to 61 yards on Sunday while Peerless Price gained 138 on the other side
of the field.  Moulds may not even be the best fantasy option on the Bills
at this point.

WR - Wayne Chrebet - A shoulder injury to Chrebet limited his production on
Sunday.  Testaverde and the passing game isn't looking very good at this
point.  You may want to bench Chrebet until he is 100% healthy.

WR - Todd Pinkston - Pinkston has become a regular on the downgrade list.
Heck, I like the guy and think he could become special.  However, he remains
to do what is needed....produce on a consistent basis.

WR - Muhsin Muhammad - Muhammad suffered a sprained shoulder and was unable
to play in the second half against San Francisco.  Heck, his production was
not missed.  It's pretty difficult to miss little to no production, if you
know what I mean.  If you're a Muhammad owner, you know what I mean.

WR - Reggie Wayne - Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday and his status
is not yet known.  He has yet to do anything special this season, but his
expectations were fairly high, so I'll downgrade him



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Waiver Wire


Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14
team leagues.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Van Pelt stepped in the lineup and looked good on
Sunday with 316 passing yards and two touchdowns.  He has a talented
receiving crew with Moulds, Price and Riemersma.  As long as he can get pass
protection, his production could be a welcome addition to fantasy teams in
need of a quarterback.

RB - Ben Gay - Gay was the feature back on Sunday with 18 carries for 56
yards and a touchdown against a quality Baltimore Ravens defense.  No other
running back has taken over the reigns of the Browns rushing offense.  Gay
may just be that guy.

RB - Amos Zeroue - Although he suffered a sprained shoulder against the
Browns, Zeroue is expected to return to the team this week against
Jacksonville.  If you have Jerome Bettis on your team, Zeroue deserves a
roster spot.  If not, you may want to take a flyer on this guy.  The
Steelers have a solid running game and an injury to Bettis would open the
door for Zeroue to produce quality numbers.

RB - Lamont Jordan - Jordan is in a similar situation as Zeroue.  If Curtis
Martin gets injured, Jordan would enter the lineup and produce quality
numbers.  Not a bad option, if you can spare a roster spot.  If you have
Curtis Martin, get Lamont Jordan.

WR - JJ Stokes - Stokes looked good on Sunday with 72 yards and a touchdown.
This marks the second consecutive game with 72 yards.  With the 49ers
looking good in the passing game, a healthy Stokes could be a decent ""spot
starter"".

WR - Keith Poole - Poole was unable to do anything on Sunday against the
Redskins.  However, he continues to learn the offense and should start
producing very shortly.  Poole's effectiveness will most likely occur with a
healthy Rod Smith garnering double/triple teams on the opposite side of the
field.

TE - ""Boo"" Williams - ""Boo"" has me excited about his potential.  He's a big,
fast tight end with good hands.  Plain and simple, he has big play potential
and should produce in the Saints offense.

is run by an insurance company. Thus, I assume there will be not only the
standard fees charged by whatever mutual fund in which you invest, but some
charge made by the ins. co. Thus, you should make certain those charges are
reasonable and defined. Additional, if the your money is actually paid by

Michael Pittman (Ari) vs Bengal  Defense?? A case of both sides being bette=

guy but I wouldn=01,t be overly excited.?

Robert Smith (Min) vs Lion  Defense?? This isn=01,t the best matchup in the=

world for Smith but you have to start him.?  If nothing else than to get an=

worth something=01(? Seriously, Smith  is one of the elite RBs right now bu=

Ahman Green (GB) vs Bear  Defense?? Find a nice toasty place to watch  this=

one.? Chicago in December.? At night.? That=01,s football.? With Dorsey Lev=

Freak=018  and now you=01,re seeing why.? I love  this kid.? These guys are=

professionals but I can promise you Green thinks about the hard hitting guy=

with  the wild eyes lined up across the way from him as the temperature=20
keeps  dropping.???

Lamar Smith (Mia) vs Bills  Defense? Smith practiced Wednesday and while it=

The Bufallo defense is solid against the  rush.? They rank # 13 in rushing =

yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? Although for the year, th=

Dolphins will rely  on the running game with Jay Fiedler likely rusty plus=

not that good to begin  with.?

Marshall Faulk (StL) vs Panther  Defense?? Let=01,s hope Faulk gets back to=
 his =20
old form.? And let=01,s hope the  Panther defense gets back more their old=

rushing defense form.? Over the last four games, Carolina ranks  # 12 in=20

Downside Matchups:? These  games favor the Defense?

Shawn Bryson / Sammy Morris / Antowain  Smith (Buf) vs Miami Defense??=20
Believe it or not, the Dolphin  Defense ranks just # 16 in rushing yards=20
allowed per game over the last four  weeks.? Granted, 3 of those games  don=
=01,t=20
factor MLB Zach Thomas but that number is still higher than I would have =

thought.? The Bills rushing game is  a mess.? The team is calling Morris=01=

little with the  opportunity and we know Smith didn=01,t produce or we woul=

I=01,d probably shy a bit from any of these guys.????

Emmitt Smith (Dal) vs Buccaneer  Defense?? Emmitt Smith said he=01,d never =
been =20
knocked out in his career but that=01,s what happened Thursday.? He=01,s bo=
unced=20
back quickly and says he=01,ll  certainly be the starter Sunday.?  The Bucs=
 are=20
tough but not invincible.? Over the last four weeks, they rank # 11  in=20
rushing yards allowed per game giving up 95 yards per game on the  ground.?=
=20
Emmitt=01,s made a living  running the ball against tough defenses over his=
=20
career so I=01,m not overly  concerned with the matchup.? He=01,s a  gamer =
and I=01,d=20
say he=01,s probably a starter for most owners this week even facing  Tampa=
 Bay.



Stephen Davis (Was) vs Giants  Defense??  Be very leery  here.? Stephen Dav=
is=20
demonstrated  last week that you have to take what he says with a grain of=
=20
salt.? Players are notoriously optimistic about  their chances for recoveri=
ng=20

allowed to the opposing RB. ?So unless you know for sure he=01,s going,  I=

strongly consider my other options.?

Terrell Fletcher (SD) vs 49er  Defense?? Fletcher is probable with a rib =
=20
fracture which must sound worse than it is.? Either that or he=01,s one tou=
gh=20
guy.? The problem is that San Francisco is  playing much improved defense=
=20
lately.?  Against the rush over the last four weeks, they rank # 9 in rushi=
ng=20
yards  allowed per game.? That=01,s a marked  contrast to their year long=
=20
numbers where they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.=
?=20
Adding  Fletcher=01,s ribs to the improved Defense, I don=01,t see much fro=
m San=20
Diego on the  ground Sunday.?

Ron Dayne / Tiki Barber (NYG) vs  Redskins??  To me, Barber is  looking muc=
h=20
more favorable in this game simply based on the opinion I don=01,t see  New=
 York=20
taking a lead where they can grind out the clock.? If you=01,re a Dayne own=
er,=20
you=01,re  painfully aware that coach Jim Fassel puts Dayne on the shelf in=

favor of Barber  when his team trails.? The Giants  are a good team but I d=

surprisingly tough situation here.?  Minnesota over the last four weeks ran=

# 7 in rushing yards allowed per  game.? For the year, they rank # 14  in=

Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.? Part of that has to do with the=
=20
Vikings  explosive offense which throws team into passing mode to catch up=
=20
but part of it  is that the Vikings are just improved there.? LB Dwayne Rud=
d=20
should miss the game with  a bad shoulder so that favors Detroit but I=01,m=

still not overly excited about the  matchup.? Still though, Stewart is  one=

of the better backs and I=01,d think he=01,s likely a starter for your team=

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense?

Mike Anderson (Den) vs Saints  Defense?? I like Mike Anderson and he=01,s a=

the  distance at any time, but I=01,m not excited about the  matchup.?

Jerome Bettis (Pit) vs Raider  Defense?? Jerome Bettis was built for =20
grinding down defenses in the December cold but he=01,ll have a tough match=
up=20
this  week against Oakland.? The Raiders  rank # 2 over the last four weeks=
=20
in rushing yards allowed per game.? That=01,s partly why their passing defe=

he=01,ll be able  to grind out some yards at home but this is clearly a=20
difficult matchup  here.?

Jerald Moore / Chad Morton (NO) vs  Bronco Defense?? Assuming Moore is ok=

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon. =

Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by De=
c.=20

Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy=
=20
when he returns before you pick him up.   =20

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When h=
e=20
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the=
=20
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a=
=20
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you=
=20
to let him go.   =20

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00=20
 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised=
=20
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't=
=20
played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want t=
o=20
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.   =
=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a=20
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to=
=20
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one =
of=20
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game t=
o=20
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy=
=20
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns=
=20
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.   =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game=20
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading=20
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has=
=20
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00=20
 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the=
=20
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of=20
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two=20
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per=20
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill shou=
ld=20
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis i=
n=20
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until=20
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major=20
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5=
=20
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another=
=20
viable option is open to you.   =20

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/11/00=20
 Marbury, who has missed New Jersey's last four games with a sprained ankle=
,=20
expects to return to the court for the Nets' Tuesday night contest against=
=20
his former team, the Minnesota Timberwolves. ""I'm playing Tuesday.=20
Absolutely,"" said Marbury. ""I know it's going to hurt. I've gotten to the=
=20
point where I feel like I'm confortable.""  Unless you have two solid guards=
=20
with four-game schedules, it would be wise to get Marbury back into your=20
starting lineup this week.   =20

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the=20
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't=
=20
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The=20
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scori=
ng=20
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to tho=
se=20
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit=
=20
Atkins if your roster allows it.   =20

 Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surger=
y=20
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured=
=20
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game=20
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland=20
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Mill=
er=20
and Brevin Knight.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00=20
 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games wi=
th=20
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in=20
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights=
=20
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes=
=20
occur. =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions=
=20
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on t=
he=20
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reported=
ly=20
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have=
=20
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will=
=20
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was=20
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who ha=
s=20
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive=
=20
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.  =20

 Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over =
a=20
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a ""leave"" by the te=
am=20
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds =
in=20
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is=20
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.  =20

 Kenny Anderson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 The Celtics activated Anderson on Sunday and placed guard Chris Carr on th=
e=20
injured list with a sprained left ankle.   Anderson had been on the injured=
=20

injury.   =20

 Erick Strickland , G NY - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Strickland sat out Saturday's home game against Denver due to a bruised=20
leg.  He was a valuable Fantasy player as a member of the Dallas Mavericks=
=20
last season but is limited now by his lack of playing time with the Knicks.=
  =20
=20

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Davis missed his second straight start for the Sonics because of a spraine=
d=20
ankle. Forward Ruben Patterson started in place of Davis, with Rashard Lewi=
s=20
moving to shooting guard.  Davis is a solid ballhandler and defender but=20
doesn't have much Fantasy value.   =20

 Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primaril=
y=20
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game =
at=20
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use i=
n=20
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.   =20

 Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley. =20
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily =
as=20
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value. =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a=
=20
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven=
=20
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the=20
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotatio=
n=20
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.    =20

 Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He=
=20
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will=20
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positi=
ve=20
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt=20
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder und=

the current conditions.   =20

 Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injur=
ed=20
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing=
=20
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.    =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur=
=20
on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rook=
ie=20
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for=20
Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined=
=20
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of t=
he=20
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.   =
 =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return =
to=20
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  ""Oak,"" who wa=
s=20
suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy valu=
e=20
as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deepe=
r=20
leagues.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00=20
 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though=
=20
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State=20
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting abou=
t=20
the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn=20
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the ver=

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00=20

Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court =
on=20
Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers.=

this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, giv=

Hill the start this week pending any setbacks.   =20

 Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for=20

",,,
138,"Dear Eric,

Another 25,417 Petitions were shipped to Florida today by
ElectionIntegrity2000.com.

Thanks to you we expect to have 100,000 signed petitions to
finalize the certification of the George W. Bush victory by
the end of the day today.  That's great news!

ElectionIntegrity2000.com has already been mentioned on
CSPAN and in the San Francisco Chronicle, but what we really
want is to turn the heads of the major networks -- and
that's going to take numbers.

Right now the mainstream media is claiming that the will of
the people favors Al Gore.  We can turn the tide --
especially if we have several hundred thousand Americans
behind us.

So don't give up!  Keep forwarding our messages, or tell
your friends directly to visit
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com

""Hand counting"" of ballots is still going on in
several counties in Florida.  Make no mistake, this fight
is far from over.  That's why we are going to keep
collecting petitions until George W. Bush is officially
certified as President-elect and until Al Gore concedes.

Remember, with every day that passes without a certified
Bush victory, Al Gore's chances of stealing this election
increase.

For Election Integrity,

Jamie Hogan

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Mean Machine Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - FDIC Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.  

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Christie was held without a point in last week's game against the Dolphins, 
but don't expect the same this week against the Colts. Christie is a solid 
Fantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between 
two teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.  

 Sylvester Morris , WR KC - FDIC Updated 12/08/00 
 Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the 
Kansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics. ""I 
missed the majority of camp, so there's not that much wear and tear on me, 
but it's still a long season,"" he said. ""It's not so bad physically. But 
every morning I get up early, earlier than I ever had to in college. In 
college, you could schedule your classes. I never had a class before 10 
o'clock. Now I'm (at the practice facility) by 8 every day. That's a 
difference.""

Hi Folks,

A couple of quick notes before we get to  this week=01,s Upgrades and Downg=
rades.

?

Replacing Ricky  Williams:?? Contrary to published reports,  Ricky Williams=
=20
bypassed surgery today to seek another opinion according to  ESPN.? The wor=
d=20
is that Jim Haslett  will likely not go outside the team for a back.? Chad=
=20
Morton and Jerald Moore will likely  be the choices with Morton getting fir=
st=20
shot.? Morton=01,s a little undersized at 5=01, 8=018  and 186 but so is Sa=
n=20
Francisco's Charlie Garner and he manages pretty  well.??Morton came from a=
=20
big  time program at USC and averaged 20+ carries a game last year so it=01=
,s=20
not like  he isn=01,t used to carrying the load.?  We=01,ll see.

Don=01,t Count Out Brett  Favre:? According to ESPN, Brett Favre=01,s foot =
is  much=20
better and he may practice this week.?  Even if he doesn't practice, he=20
thinks he may be able to play and keep his  record streak of consecutive=20
starts intact.

Akili Smith Benched.? Not  just benched.? Benched for Scott  Mitchell.? Tha=
t=01,
s gotta  hurt.

Marshall Faulk Raring to  Go?? With Trung Canidate out for the  year with a=
=20
broken wrist, Marshall Faulk has reportedly told the coaches he may  be abl=
e=20
to play this week.? Most  think that=01,s too optimistic but it=01,s nice t=
o see=20
the desire there.?=20



Jeff George to  Start??According to the Redskins, Jeff George will start =
=20
again this week at QB.? Coach Norv Turner has stated the starting QB job is=
 =20
Brad?Johnson's when he's?healthy, possibly in?week 13.  ?

?

Let's jump right into our Upgraded and  Downgraded Players.? As we head dow=
n=20
the home stretch, identifying  those players moving up or down can be the=
=20
difference between making the  playoffs or watching from the sidelines.?  A=
s=20
we head into our 12th week of listing these players, it=01,s  inevitable th=
at=20
some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade  list.? Make sure=
=20
you understand,  what we=01,re talking about is players that are moving.? I=
n=20
other words, a player like TE Chad  Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis=
t=20
and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.? It just  means I=
=01,m=20
concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Likewise, a player like WR=
=20
Laveranues  Coles may make the upgrade list even though he=01,s still fairl=
y far=20
down the list  of WRs.? It=01,s all about which  direction players are movi=
ng.? =20
Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the  difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving Up

QB Mark  Brunell (Jac)?? I=01,m one of those guys who quickly  points out=
=20
Brunell has never put together fantasy numbers to warrant the hype he =20
receives but you can=01,t deny what Brunell has done lately.? Behind a beat=
 up=20
line, he=01,s standing in  there (while taking a beating) and delivering th=
e=20
ball.? Jimmy Smith made a roaring comeback and  paired with Keenan McCardel=
l,=20
they=01,re one of the better WR tandems in the  league.? =20

QB Kerry  Collins (NYG)? A few weeks ago, I took some (deserved)  lumps for=
=20
my early praise of Collins but he=01,s kicking his game up a notch of  late=
.? He=20
looks more comfortable in  the pocket, especially in his footwork and drop=
=20
backs.? Watch to see how Amani Toomer is doing  but when he=01,s healthy, T=
oomer=20
and Ike Hilliard make a great WR corps.? A?solid ground game in Ron Dayne a=
nd=20
Tiki  Barber continue to help the passing game.

QB? Donovan McNabb (Phi)? With  Deuce Staley gone, McNabb=01,s had to shoul=
der=20
the offense and this week he came  through with flying colors.? The bad  ne=
ws=20
is he only completed 47% of his passes Sunday.? The good news is he threw t=
he=20
ball 55  times.? When a QB airs it out 55  times in one game, it doesn=01,t=
=20
usually bode well for the team=01,s chances of  winning but it=01,s certain=
ly a=20
plus for your FF team to see that many  attempts.? With that many chances, =
=20
it=01,s like allowing yourself to double the stats a Jeff Blake (23 attempt=
s=20
this  week) or Jeff Garcia (25 attempts) puts up.? Unless you have a really=
=20
good feeling  about Stanley Pritchett or Darnell Autry, I=01,d think you=01=
,ll see=20
him continue to  throw often.

QB Trent  Dilfer (Bal)?? Remember, this list is  relative.? While he may no=
t=20
be a  starter, Dilfer is definitely moving up the charts and that=01,s what=
 this=20
list is  all about.? He actually looked very  good at times in the huge=20
victory over Tennessee Sunday.? He showed nice poise coming back after =20
basically throwing the game away a few plays earlier.? Brian Billick did=20
wonders with a  marginally talented Tony Banks in 1999 and it=01,s conceiva=
ble=20
he might do it here  again with Dilfer.? They play Dallas  and Cleveland ne=
xt=20
but keep in mind Baltimore has a bye on December  3.

QB Troy  Aikman (Dal)? When I=01,m bashing Mark Brunell as a  Fantasy QB, I=
=20
usually compare him to Troy Aikman =01) Great real NFL QB but not a  much f=
or=20
Fantasy GMs.? Notice a  pattern here?? After being named the  starter Sunda=
y,=20
Aikman went out and lit up the Bengal Defense which was ranked #  20 over t=
he=20
last 4 weeks.? It=01,s hard  to put too much faith in him but if you=01,re=
=20
desperate for a QB, he could be worth  a gamble.? Tough matchup this week  =
vs=20
Baltimore but he gets the Vikings in week 13.

QB Jeff  Blake? (NO)? You of course know by now that RB Ricky Williams is =
=20
gone for 6-8 weeks.? I hate it for  Williams owners (I=01,m one) but what=
=01,s done=20
is done.? All we can do now is look forward.? And looking forward, I see=20
Blake being  forced to carry an increased load.?  QB Donovan McNabb threw t=
he=20
ball 55 times Sunday in the wake of losing RB  Deuce Staley and I could=20
easily see a similar type situation in New Orleans with  Blake throwing a l=
ot=20
more passes.

QB Rob  Johnson (Buf)? I make it a point to hold my tongue on  coaching=20
issues but I=01,ve gotta say I think Mr. Charisma with the Spiffy  Sweaters=
,=20
Wade Phillips, is 100% wrong in going to Johnson.? In terms of roster=20
management, he=01,s  hands down the worst in the NFL in my opinion.? But no=
ne of=20
that really matters as Rob  Johnson has to make the upgrade list since he=
=01,s=20
been named the starter for this  week.? Don=01,t get too excited,  though.?=
=20
Johnson finishes roughly  half the games he starts and the next three weeks=
=20
vs Kansas City, Tampa Bay and  Miami could be brutal.? =20

QB Matt  Hasselbeck (GB)? Hasselbeck played nicely replacing Favre  this=20
week.? Remember there was even  some talk about trading Favre and starting=
=20
Hasselbeck this summer when Favre=01,s  elbow was a big concern.? Before yo=
u =20
give up the farm to snare Hasselbeck, you should know Brett Favre is=20
reportedly  feeling better and hoping to play this week.? We=01,ll keep you=
 =20
posted.

QB Shane  Matthews / Cade McNown (Chi)? Again, I=01,m highlighting guys mov=
ing =20
up.? With the injury to Jim Miller,  Shane Matthews will be thrust into the=
=20
starting role.? The injury will also likely add a little  fire under Cade=
=20
McNown who may be rushed back a little sooner than he would have  been if=
=20
Miller was performing well.?  Matthews looked very rusty but it=01,s tough =
to=20
judge a QB when he=01,s thrust  into the game like that.? I=01,d look  for =
Matthews=20
at least for this week against a tough Tampa Bay defense and then  we=01,ll=
=20
see.? =20

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Lamar  Smith (Mia)? You have to keep giving this guy his  props after=20
another great game.?  Although, if you=01,ve got an owner salivating over S=
mith=20
and you can get a  lot in return, it might be a great time to trade him.? I=
=20
can=01,t imagine his value being any  higher.? His yard per carry number  d=
ipped=20
to 2.6 in Sunday=01,s game and he faces the Jets this week plus a brutal =
=20
matchup against Tampa Bay in week 15.? =20



RB Edgerrin  James (Ind)? It=01,s tough to upgrade a guy already near  the =
top=20
but he put in another great game Sunday with 155 total yards and shows =20
little sign of slowing down.? He  averaged 4.2? yards per carry Sunday  and=
=20
the Colts are leaning heavily on him.?  Watch out for a tough November 26=
=20
matchup vs Miami  though.

RB Robert  Smith (Min)? Smith quietly is having an incredible  year.? He=01=
,s=20
put those hang nail  injury jokes way behind him as he=01,s become one of t=
he=20
best RBs in the  league.? He=01,s running between the  tackles for the toug=
h=20
yards and catching the ball exceptionally well.? Keep an eye on that tasty=
=20
week 13  matchup against the Cowboys.? =20

RB Fred  Taylor (Jac)? Jaguar Fans may be distraught, but Fred  Taylor owne=
rs=20
have to be happy, at least lately.? Taylor=01,s running as well as he has i=
n =20
his career, even if his team is struggling.? One can only wonder what he=01=
,d be=20
doing  with a healthy supporting cast.?  He=01,s got two tough weeks coming=
=20
against Pittsburgh and Tennessee.? But as everyone knows, Taylor has a  gre=
at=20
stretch run of opponents in weeks 14-16 when he faces Cleveland, Arizona  a=
nd=20
Cincinnati.? =20

RB Jamal  Anderson (Atl)? If you didn=01,t know better, you might  have tho=
ught=20
you were watching tape from 1998 if you saw Anderson Sunday.? He ran hard a=
nd=20
with the power and  quickness that pushed him to stardom.?? Hopefully, he=
=01,ll=20
be able to  maintain that form.

RB Michael  Pittman (Ari)? Pittman=01,s nursing a chest / rib injury  so ke=
ep an=20
eye on that but assuming he=01,s ok, he has to make the upgrade  list.? He=
=20
scored a TD Sunday and  averaged 4.2 yards per carry on 12 carries.? He als=
o=20
added 8 receptions.? His main competition for carries, Thomas  Jones, had a=
=20
yard per carry average that equaled his fumbles Sunday:? 1.00???

RB Justin  Watson (StL)? Watson held his own Sunday as he rushed  for 62=20
yards on 17 carries.??  He likely won=01,t be a factor long as Marshall Fau=
lk is=20
already itching to  get back on the field but he might be worth a shot for=
=20
one more  week.?

RB Ahman  Green (GB)? With Dorsey Levens=01, troubles, Green  clearly shoot=
s up=20
the charts.? He=01,s  an enormously talented RB, but he=01,s got to learn h=
ow to=20
turn that talent into on  the field production.? After a tough  Tampa Bay=
=20
game last Sunday, he faces a soft schedule with the Colts, Panthers,  Bears=
,=20
Lions and Minnesota coming up.



RB Chad  Morton (NO)? With Ricky Williams out for the next 6-8  weeks, the=
=20
logical guy to attempt to fill his shoes is the rookie from USC,  Morton.?=
=20
He=01,s Detroit WR Johnnie  Morton=01,s little brother and was reportedly e=
xtremely=20
close to Ricky Williams and  shaken with his injury.? He=01,s small  but ve=
ry=20
quick.? He=01,s not as big as  you=01,d probably like but neither is Charli=
e=20
Garner.? Last year at USC, he carried a full load  as the featured rusher s=
o=20
he=01,s capable.?  The team hasn=01,t announced their plans yet and bringin=
g in a=20
free agent is  a possibility but I=01,d expect Morton to get a shot first.?=
 New=20
Orleans has a fairly favorable  rushing schedule ahead with Oakland, Denver=
,=20
San Francisco and Atlanta all  ahead.=20

??

WRs Moving Up

WR James  McKnight (Dal)? Wow.? What else can you say but give the man =20
credit.? 8 catches for 164 yards  with a TD is a pretty good day.?  Whether=
=20
he and Troy Aikman can keep it rolling is the question but you  have to lik=
e=20
what he=01,s done thus far.?  He=01,s got a brutal matchup next week in Bal=
timore=20
but he might be worth  grabbing to play against the Vikings in week 13.?

WR Sean  Dawkins? (Sea)? Excuse  us for not getting excited about a guy who=
=20
was buried on the Seahawks a few  weeks ago and had Jon Kitna throwing to=
=20
him.? But Kitna=01,s looking better and Dawkins  responded with a great gam=
e.?=20
Like  McKnight, the question is whether he can keep it up but he=01,s worth=
 a=20
roll of the  dice.?

WR Torry  Holt (StL)? I drew a few snickers a month ago when I  said I=20
thought Derrick Mason was the best WR on the Titans.? I=01,m just about rea=
dy to=20
call Torry Holt  the best WR in St. Louis.? And  that=01,s no knock on Isaa=
c=20
Bruce.?  Holt=01,s really coming into his own and to be honest, benefits gr=
eatly=20
from  the attention Isaac Bruce draws.? He  does face a couple of strong=20
defenses in Washington and New Orleans but I=01,m  betting he manages to pr=
oduce=20
against tough competition.?

WR Derrick  Mason (Ten)? Mason is clearly the best WR on the  team. Partly =
by=20
default as Kevin Dyson=01,s gone and Carl Pickens is injured.? But partly=
=20
because he=01,s just that  good.? The Titans had their running  game shut d=
own=20
by Baltimore Sunday and they were forced to the air.? And much to the=20
surprise of many, QB  Steve McNair fared pretty well and Mason was a big pa=
rt=20
of that  success.?

WR Ricky  Proehl (StL)? Great, just what Fantasy GMs need =01)  Another Ram=
 WR=20
to worry about.?  Proehl caught 6 passes for 53 yards and a TD Sunday.? In =
an=20
offense missing RB Marshall Faulk  as high powered as the Rams, there=01,s=
=20
probably room for another WR at the  trough.???

WR Patrick  Johnson (Bal)? Johnson replaced Travis Taylor in the  lineup an=
d=20
came up big with the game winning TD.? He only caught 3 passes but=20
understand  that he=01,s the 3rd receiver behind TE Shannon Sharpe and WR Q=
adry =20
Ismail.? Still though, it=01,s a Brian  Billick team and Trent Dilfer is pl=
aying=20
better with each series it  seems.?

WR Jimmy  Smith? (Jac)???  With 10 catches for 117 yards, I guess you can s=
ay=20
he=01,s back.? The Jags may be struggling but Smith and  QB Mark Brunell ar=
e=20
back in synch.?  Ride it while the combo is hot.?

WR Jerome  Pathon (Ind)? Terrence Wilkins had a firm grasp on the  #2 WR sp=
ot=20
early in the season but Pathon seems to be taking over there.? Pathon is=20
playing with more confidence  and more importantly, seems to have the=20
confidence of QB Peyton Manning.? He had 3 catches for 42 yards  Sunday.?

?

TEs Moving Up?

TE Bubba  Franks (GB)? For a long while Franks and TE Tyrone  Davis had=20
battled for time.? It=01,s  now looking like Franks has prevailed as Davis =
is=20
seeing very little time.? Franks made a great catch of the fake  kick TD an=
d=20
is showing some of the athleticism that caught the Packers=01, eye in  the =
draft.

TE Rod  Rutledge (NE)? So much for Eric Bjornson.? Rutledge seems to be the=
=20
new TE threat  for the Patriots and you know Drew Bledsoe likes to throw to=
=20
the TE.? If he can just get that thumb  healthy=01(?

TE Shannon  Sharpe (Bal)?? After some quiet weeks, Sharpe has  returned to=
=20
his place of one of the premier TEs in the game.? He=01,s clearly the best=
=20
receiver on the  team and has the confidence of QB Trent Dilfer.? Just as=
=20
importantly, he seems to have  confidence in Dilfer.

???

QBs Moving  Down?

QB Trent  Green (StL)? Mike Martz said a couple of weeks ago he  felt that=
=20
having Green behind center was =01&just like having Kurt in there=018.? We =
believe=20
him.? If you=01,re going to deal him, now=01,s the  time.? Even as well as =
he=01,s=20
been  playing, the league MVP Warner does not lose his job to a broken hand=
.?=20
The team is talking about December 3 as  a possible date he=01,ll be back b=
ut I=01,
ve heard even sooner.? Regardless, you have to figure his days  are=20
numbered.? Plus, upcoming games  against Washington and New Orleans in the=
=20
next two weeks could pose a  threat.?

QB Doug  Flutie? (Buf)? Right  or wrong, Flutie takes a seat as Rob Johnson=
=01,s=20
been named the starter this  week.? Hold onto him though as I=01,ve  got to=
=20
think the chances of Johnson staying healthy for long are  slim.



QB Drew  Bledsoe (NE)? So much for the Boston Globe=01,s Bill  Belichick=20
conspiracy that Bledsoe would miss several weeks.? Still though, you could=
=20
clearly see he  wasn=01,t 100% with the thumb.???

QB Brett  Favre (GB)? As you know, Favre suffered a sprained  foot against=
=20
Tampa.? While everyone  was shouting about how many weeks he=01,d miss, Fav=
re=20
told anyone who=01,d listen  today that he looked to be ready for this week=
=01,s=20
game against Indianapolis.? Players are notoriously optimistic so  keep an=
=20
eye on it.?

QB Elvis  Grbac (KC)? Don=01,t get me wrong, Grbac is still a top  QB.? He =
just=20
showed Sunday he=01,s  human.? He really should have done  more against San=

when they  lost?=01(?

QB Brian  Griese (Den)? It=01,s the 3rd quarter of the  Monday Night game a=
s I=20
type this and it=01,s pretty obvious Brian Griese is at less  than 100% arm=
=20
strength.? Keep an eye  on this.? He=01,s a gutsy kid and has  played throu=
gh a=20
lot but it does seem to be affecting his  play.?

QB Charlie  Batch (Det)Another game, another  less than impressive=20
performance.?  Batch just seems to struggle to get anything done.???

QB Akili  Smith (Cin)? I=01,ve been ripping this guy for weeks and now I fe=
el =20
sorta bad for him as he=01,s been benched=01(for Scott Mitchell. That=01,s =
gotta =20
hurt.?

QB Jim  Miller (Chi)? Talk about blowing an opportunity.? Miller had been=
=20
moving the Bears and  looked to be the spark Chicago was missing with Cade=
=20
McNown.? And then Mr. Achilles decided he didn=01,t  want to participate.? =
Nasty=20
injury  and too bad as he was showing promise.???

?

RBs Moving Down? =20

RB Charlie  Garner (SF)? Garner=01,s been a regular on the upgrade  list an=
d he=20
had another huge game Sunday where he posted 141 total yards with a  TD=20
against the Chiefs.? Two big days  loom on the horizon though.? I  promise=
=20
you he=01,ll be shut out in week 13=01(he has a bye.? And then he faces San=
 Diego=20
and New  Orleans in week 14 and 15.? He=01,s a  great player and one of the=
 best=20
RBs in the game but he=01,ll be facing some tough  matchups coming up.?

RB Ricky  Williams (NO)? As I reported yesterday to our email  subscribers,=
=20
Ricky Williams suffered a broken ankle and will miss 6-8  weeks.? I had to=
=20
chuckle watching  Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett talk about how Ricky doesn=
=01,t=20
play defense and  didn=01,t make any of those sacks or force any fumbles an=
d=20
about how Ricky=01,s just  one guy and they=01,ll be fine.? Yada yada  yada=
. ?That=20
sounds good Jim but you=01,re in for a rude awakening if  you really believ=
e=20
that (I don=01,t think he does)? Chad Morton will be the likely  replacemen=
t.?=20
Jerald Moore will get  a shot too.???

RB Tshimanga  Biakabutuka (Car)? 1.7 yards per carry will not get it done f=
or=20
a  featured RB in this league and that=01,s exactly what Biakabutuka posted=
 =20
Sunday.? He=01,s got to get back on  track if the Panthers are to be effect=
ive=20
as a team.?

RB Mike  Alstott (TB)? It seems as if Alstott is less of a factor every =20
game.? He only had 9 rushing  attempts Sunday for 38 yards.? If I  were him=
,=20
I=01,d pay Keyshawn to tell the coaches I needed some  carries=01(?

RB Emmitt  Smith (Dal)? What a disappointing game vs the Bengals Sunday.?=
=20
Smith fumbled early on what should have  been a sure TD and never seemed to=
=20
recover.? I thought he=01,d carry the load for a  struggling Aikman.? Turne=
d out=20
the  other way around.?

RB Shaun  Alexander (Sea)? So much for the idea of coach Mike  Holmgren=20
throwing in the towel for 2000 and starting the young players like =20
Alexander.? The rookie is a fine  player and will get his time but for now,=
=20
it doesn=01,t=01, seem to be happening  anytime soon.?

RB Trung  Canidate? (StL)?  Canidate broke his wrist Sunday and will miss t=
he=20
rest of the  season.? I have no idea how the Rams  will function without=20
him.?

?

WRs Moving Down?

WR Marvin  Harrison (Ind)? Is it just me or is Marvin Harrison  getting mor=
e=20
and more quiet with each game?? He only had 4 catches for 34 yards  Sunday=
=20
and didn=01,t seem to be a big factor.?  He=01,s still one of the best WRs =
out=20
there but I=01,m worried about his  production.?

WR Terry  Glenn (NE)? Glenn=01,s faded down the stretch and the  Bledsoe th=
umb=20
injury won=01,t help his play one bit.? Don=01,t be too down on him as he d=
oes=20
have  some favorable matchups on the horizon.?  But if Bledsoe can=01,t go,=
 it=01,s=20
trouble for Glenn.?

WR Marcus  Robinson (Chi)? The loss of QB Jim Miller is huge.? The Bears ar=
e=20
now with their #3 QB and  you can only expect so much.?  Robinson will make=
=20
any QB better but there=01,s only so much he can  do.?

WR Antonio  Freeman (GB)? Freeman appears to be headed toward the  path he=
=20
was on a few weeks ago =01) mediocrity.? And that was with a healthy Favre.=
?=20
With a?less than  healthy?Favre, it could be worse.???

WR Jacquez  Green (TB)? Keyshawn Johnson=01,s gain is Green=01,s loss  as Q=
B Shaun=20
King seems locked in on Johnson.? Green will still catch the occasional  lo=
ng=20
ball but it appears for now, he=01,s the clear cut #2 WR.?

WR Terrence  Wilkins (Ind)? Suddenly, Terrence Wilkins is the  forgotten ma=
n=20
in the Colts passing game.?  For some reason, Peyton Manning just isn=01,t=
=20
giving him the looks.???

?

TEs Moving Down?

TE Kyle  Brady (Jac)? Brady=01,s still a solid TE but with the  return of J=
immy=20
Smith, it=01,s clear that he won=01,t be the big target he had  been.???

TE Jay  Reimersma (Buf)? Reimersma was a total non factor in  Sunday=01,s g=

catching only 1 pass for 7 yards.? One has to think the QB shuffle could =
=20
have an effect.?

TE Itula  Mili (Sea)? Mili=01,s yielded his starting TE job to  Christian F=

 Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primaril=
y=20
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game =
at=20
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use i=
n=20
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.   =20

 Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley. =20
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily =
as=20
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value. =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a=
=20
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven=
=20
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the=20
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotatio=
n=20
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.    =20

 Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He=
=20
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will=20
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positi=
ve=20
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt=20
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder und=
er=20
the current conditions.   =20

 Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injur=
ed=20
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing=
=20
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.    =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur=
=20
on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rook=
ie=20
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for=20
Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined=
=20
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of t=
he=20
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.   =
 =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return =
to=20
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  ""Oak,"" who wa=
s=20
suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy valu=
e=20
as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deepe=
r=20
leagues.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00=20
 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though=
=20
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State=20
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting abou=
t=20
the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn=20
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the ver=
y=20
latest, so add a little ""Vinsanity"" to your starting lineup next week.   =
=20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00=20
 Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The=20
Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court =
on=20
Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers.=
=20
Hill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights=
=20
this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, giv=
e=20
Hill the start this week pending any setbacks.   =20

 Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for=20
Friday's game against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but=
=20
has very little Fantasy value.    =20

 Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Nash returned to action against the Knicks Wednesday after missing two=20
straight games because of a calf injury.  He didn't seem to be bothered by=
=20
the injury as he scored 14 points and dished off for six assists.  It is no=
w=20
safe to play Nash on your Fantasy team again.    =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Marshall is recovering from a sprained knee and is questionable for=20
Thursday's game against the Grizzlies.  Look for starters Bryon Russell and=
=20
Karl Malone to play extra minutes in his absence.  Avoid using Marshall unt=
il=20
he appears to be fully recovered.   =20

 Kevin Garnett , F MIN - Farragut Academy Updated 12/07/00=20
 Garnett hurt his right ring finger in Tuesday's game and was scheduled to=
=20
have it examined Wednesday.  He is expected to play against the Wizards=20
Thursday.  Monitor Garnett's situation.  Something as simple as an injured=
=20
finger on his shooting hand could lead to an offensive slump and affect his=
=20
Fantasy numbers.   =20

 Terry Davis , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Davis will be eligible to come off the injured list Sunday but Achilles=20
tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep him sidelined a little bit=
=20
longer.  He has been injury prone throughout his career and doesn't have mu=
ch=20
Fantasy value.   =20

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00=20
 McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday's game against the Heat=
=20
and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against the Magic.  Keon Clark=
=20
will start at power forward if McDyess is unable to play.  The leg is sore=
=20
now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few days.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00=20
 Hill may be ready to return to the court for Thursday night's game against=
=20
the Nuggets. He has missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he=
=20
practiced on Wednesday, and all indications signal his return to the court.=
=20
""I can't give you the official thumbs up,"" said Head Coach Doc Rivers, ""but=
=20
it looks good."" Fantasy owners who have been waiting for Hill's return will=
=20
likely get him back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a=20
four-game West Coast road trip.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 According to The Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful=
=20
that Trent will travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing o=
n=20
the East Coast.  Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but coul=
d=20
be back in action in another two weeks.  He has been sidelined since the=20
first preseason game with a strained upper abductor muscle.  Trent is a goo=
d=20
inside scorer and a solid rebounder but is injury prone.  When he does retu=
rn=20
Fantasy owners should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately=
=20
need a forward.    =20

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00=20
 Marbury missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of a=
n=20
ankle injury. He turned the ankle last  Friday night in Orlando, then turne=
d=20
it again the following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is=20
still lacking some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankl=
e=20
is diminishing. Marbury hopes to return on Friday night when the Nets host=
=20
the Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have the=
ir=20
star point guard back in time for next week's roster changes. =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00=20
 Carter was in uniform for Wednesday night's game against Portland, but he=
=20
didn't see any playing time. ""Air Canada"" said that he felt well enough to=
=20
play, but team doctors wouldn't give him permission to get in the game. ""We=
'd=20
like to have him back as soon as possible,"" said Head Coach Lenny Wilkens,=
=20
""but we're not going to bring him back before he's ready."" Toronto finishes=
=20
their three-game West Coast swing on Friday night against Golden State, at=
=20
which time Carter hopes to make his return. The Raptors' star should be bac=
k=20
before Monday, so most Fantasy owners can re-insert him into their lineup i=
n=20
time for next week.   =20

 Andre Miller , G CLE - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00=20
 Miller took a knee to the nose during Wednesday night's game at Chicago=20
which sent him to the bench temporarily. He returned to the game with a=20
vengeance, finishing with 20 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in=20
Cleveland's 92-88 victory. The shot to the nose won't keep Miller from=20
missing any playing time, so continue to use the young point guard in your=
=20
starting lineup.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00=20
 Brand missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night against=20
Cleveland. He is reportedly making progress with his hyperextended left kne=
e,=20
and has been able to run on a treadmill this week.  Brand is listed as day =
to=20
day, and says that he has about a 50 percent chance of playing on Friday=20
night against Dallas. With most roster changes occurring on Monday, Fantasy=
=20
owners should be able to put the Bulls' star back in their lineup for next=
=20
week's games.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/06/00=20
 The 76ers will be without Snow for six to eight weeks after a CT scan=20
Wednesday showed a stress fracture in his right ankle. He was second on the=
=20
team with a career-high 12.2 ppg, and led the Sixers with 6.6 assists per=
=20
contest. Although Philadelphia sports a deep roster, one can't help but=20
assume this will have an impact on the team's fortunes for Fantasy purposes=
. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Dudley will travel with the Suns on their end of the week road-trip that=
=20
starts in Milwaukee Thursday.  He will most likely be questionable for all=
=20
the games.  Look for him to finally return to action next week.  With Dudle=
y=20
out of the lineup Corie Blount and rookie Daniel Santiago will continue to=
=20
get playing time.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley's rebounding=20
makes him a starter on your Fantasy team if you are using a reserve in his=
=20
position.   =20

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Mills is doubtful for Wednesday's game against the Lakers because of pain =
in=20
his right ankle.  He was scheduled to see a foot specialist on Tuesday and=
=20
underwent surgery last season to remove bone spurs from the ankle.  Sit Mil=
ls=20
on your Fantasy bench for now.  If you are playing in a small league drop h=
im=20
from your roster and add another forward.    =20

 Ron Mercer , G CHI - The Old School Fools Updated 12/06/00=20
 Mercer sat out of Tuesday's game against the T'Wolves because of the flu. =
=20
Corey Benjamin started at shooting guard in place of Mercer.  Mercer's stat=
us=20
for Wednesday's game is up in the air.  He has been a major disappointment =
so=20
far this season.  If you play in a deep Fantasy league keep him on your=20
roster, if you are in a smaller one look to make an upgrade at guard.  The=
=20
way Mercer has been producing you shouldn't have a hard time finding a bett=
er=20
guard.   =20

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Williams sprained his ankle in Tuesday's game against the Grizzlies and is=
=20
questionable for Wednesday's contest at Seattle.  The ankle will probably=
=20
limit Williams' production in the next few games so use a healthy forward=
=20
instead.   =20

 Billy Owens , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Owens strained his right biceps in Tuesday's game against Vancouver.  He h=
as=20
actually been productive this season when healthy, but don't gamble on him.=
 =20
Owens has been injury prone throughout his career and is too risky a player=
=20
to take a chance on.  Use a more durable player instead.    =20

 Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Smith got his first start as a Piston Tuesday at power forward.  He scored=
=20
12 points and grabbed eight rebounds.  With his promotion into the starting=
=20
lineup it is now safe to start Smith on your Fantasy team.  With an increas=
ed=20
role Smith will be a consistent rebounder and scorer.   =20

 John Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Wallace was placed on the injured list due to tendonitis in his left knee.=
 =20
He is a good offensive player but his shortcomings on defense have limited=
=20
his playing time.  His lack of playing time prevents him from being a=20
productive Fantasy player so avoid using him in your league     =20

Short of hand-counting each snowflake that has fallen in Telluride, resort 
officials have projected that nearly 4 feet of snow has blanked the area in 
the past three weeks. 9 inches of fresh snow fell overnight to the 
overwhelming joy of town residents. Resort officials are reporting a 29-inch 
base on the mountain, with more than a week to go before the ski area opens 
to skiers and snowboarders.

""Gearing up for one of the resort's best openings in recent history ranks up 
there, as far as current events, with finding out who our next Presidnet will 
be,"" said Steve Swenson, vice president of sales, marketing and air service 
for the Telluride Ski & Golf Company.

The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our fallen brethren.  Yes Jason Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb. 2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the bachelor party. 

The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of Houston) called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost should run about $50 a person for the cruise - drinks and ""gourmet"" dinner included or $35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know which one you would prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.  Gambling expenses are not included in the above calculations.

*  North American Gas has now decreased its overall average daily EOL deal 
count by about 500 trades a day since November.  There are now approximately 
2,633 trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being traded on EOL.

*  The Financial Desk in North American Gas has increased its average daily 
EOL deal count by about 45% since October, from 494 to 714 deals per day in 
November.  In December, the average daily EOL deal count was down 8%, from 
714 to 658 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily EOL volume has 
decreased steadily in December.

*  ECC Canada West Gas has decreased its average daily EOL deal count by 
about 46% since November, from 213 to 113 deals per day.  In addition, the 
average daily EOL volume has decreased about 40% since November.  However, 
the average daily Non-EOL deal count has only decreased by about 10% since 
November, from 88 to 79 deals per day.

*  US West Power has decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 71% 
since November, from 187 to 54 deals per day.  However, the average daily 
Non-EOL Deal Count has decreased by only about 21% since November, from 171 
to 136 deals per day.  The average daily combined EOL and Non-EOL volume has 
remained steady.

*  US East Power has decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 24% 
since November, from 167 to 127 deals per day.  However, the average daily 
Non-EOL Deal Count has actually increased by about 3% since November, from 
230 to 237 deals per day.  The average daily combined EOL and Non-EOL volume 
has increased by about 20% total.  These recent trends in Power may indicate 
a shift in on-line power transactions from EOL to our competitors.

*  LPG's has steadily increased its total monthly EOL deal count from 281 in 
September, 398 in October, to 444 in November.  In December,  LPG's appear to 
have levelled off with 449 deals completed in December.  The total monthly 
EOL volumes have increased similarly as well.

*  Coal trades have decreased significantly from the levels seen in October.  
The total monthly EOL deal count for November was only about 23% of the total 
in October.  The total monthly EOL deal count for December was only about 83% 
of the total in November.

*  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has risen by approximately 47% since 
November, from a daily average of 242 to a daily average of 357 for December.

",Theresa Sheila Glover,,
235,"Charlene:  Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our 
meeting on Wednesday morning.  I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so 
it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.  

Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became 
concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other 
supporters of the program.   Many of those expressing frustration are heavily 
involved in the recruiting process.   It is their commitment to both 
recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting 
talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program. 

I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would 
bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss 
them with you in a constructive manner.  Our intent is continued support and 
improvement of the program.   The meeting took place on March 28 and included 
the following:

 Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU

 Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT  

 Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida

 Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of 
Florida

 Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU

 Carolyn Barrett  EBS    

 Howard Selzer  Enron Global E&P 


Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:

One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an 
announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.  Not much 
materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be 
managed.  In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw 
that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and 
differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.  We 
feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program 
on campus. 

SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is 
impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an 
innovative company.  The July start date does not consider December graduates 
and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in 
May.  

Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed 
senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or 
communication about the program.   We hear rumors of ""tracks"", but no facts 
or details.  Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some 
had not.  

Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support 
staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily 
focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.

Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many 
of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join 
with you in some of your plans for the program.   We are concerned that 
decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum 
without what could be some valuable input from some of us.  

MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team 
and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on 
campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top 
candidates and the pride of participants in the program.  We feel that the 
focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and 
we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.

meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 to discuss and revise.  I don't want to ""mass

or over the weekend anyway.)  Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vickers and 
Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and power 
covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation in 
person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).  They will likely 
come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presentation 
could be tweaked.  With revisions from this session, then it makes sense to 
set up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the word to 
the whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).  We can start 
those next week and finish most next week.  I think that the logistics of any 
offsite would be difficult with schedules and I don't really think that we 
need one.

deliver it.  You and I can discuss that in more detail.   Max will be in from 
Mexico on April 20, and Beth Apollo has already booked some time with him on 
that day for us to cover this information.  Laura Luce is here today and will 
be back in Houston next Wednesday, April 11.  I have booked time with her 
that afternoon to cover the presentation.  That will leave Portland as the 
other ""out of towner"" to schedule.  I am planning a trip there the next time 
that Stacey White heads up there.  Right now we are looking at April 17, 18

Houston or on the trips that we will need to make.  You and I can discuss the

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.",,$1 billion $4 billion,JPMorgan Salomon Smith Barney Our Northern Natural Gas Company Transwestern Pipeline Company Our Board of Directors the Board - William Powers The University of Texas School of Law Special Committee Dean Powers Enron The Securities & Exchange Commission SEC Moody's Baa1 BBB EnronOnline EES Home Depot Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's

Using one login ID, Bob can open two seperate Stack Manager windows on two PCs and set up different product filters on each for purposes of managing his different regions. The only drawback here is that whichever stack he closes last will save the product defaults and he will have to set up his seperate breakout for the other region each time he logs in (a proces that may take a minute or two depending on how many products he is managing).

To avoid this, we could set him up with a second Stack Manager ID and he could simply maintain two distinct stacks. If he would like a second Stack Manager ID, just let me know and I will forward the request to Stephanie Sever for setup.

284,"Kenny, as you may know, there were 9 environmental applications submitted
to various local, state, and regional agencies requesting approval to
initiate this project and most of the requests apply to crossing the bypass
channel.   As of today, we have received one approval, and that from the
State Fire Marshall, Office of Pipeline Safety granting us a waiver so that
we can lay the pipe above ground as opposed to below ground.  I have calls
into  the other agencies  for which applications and requests were
submitted but have had no reply.  I would caution that we might get into
trouble for initiating a construction project without consent and approval
from a particular agency, as agencies many times look at an entire project
even though their jurisdiction may only apply in one specific area of a
project.  This is particularily the case in air permitting where an
applicant can not even construct a road or bring in construction materials
until the air permit is issued.  Because this is my first project in
California, Id like to be sure of this and make follow up calls to all
agencies for which applications and requests were submitted and verify that
we can initiate the construction, as long as we dont impact a specific  or
strategic portion (ie  the bypass channel)  for sometime down the road when
we are well into the project.   Ill call you tomorrow and let you
know.......

287,"If the bottom line is being able to start critical construction activities as 
quickly as possible, rather than properly characterizing the type of permit 
revision, we have developed an argument, based on the Clean Air Act (which is 
the source for Arizona's air program), that would allow construction to 
commence shortly after notice, without the need for a permit. Of course, TWP 
has already submitted a permit revision application and would be willing to 
see this process through to completion as long as TWP could begin 
construction promptly and plan on beginning operation of the new equipment 
when the permit is finallly issued, presumably in the spring.

The argument goes as follows: under CAA sec 502(b)(10), 42 USC 7661a(b)(10),  
a state program needs to allowchanges within a permitted facility if the 
changes are not ""modifications"" and do not exceed the emissions allowable 
under the permit. A ""modification"" is defined as ""any physical change in, or 
change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the 
amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the 
emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted.""

 Someone should confirm the technical status of the equipment changes and 
whether they meet the criteria. This may be something to point out to Nancy 
how she can exercise her discretion to get us where we need to go. Nancy can 
give this approval after Shudeish completes his calculations confirming TWP's 
netting calculations.

NORWAY: INTERVIEW-Danish wind firm Vestas to expand into Europe, US.
By Birgitte Dyrekilde

04/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

RINGKOEBING, West Denmark, April 18 (Reuters) - Danish wind turbine maker 
Vestas Wind Systems said on Wednesday it was heading for expansion in Europe 
and the U.S and expects to regain lost terrain in the world`s largest wind 
power market Germany. 
""We see our market share in Germany rising to 16-20 percent this year after 
last year`s drop by three percentage points to 13 percent,"" Vestas Chief 
Executive Johannes Poulsen told Reuters in an interview at the company`s 
headquarters in Ringkoebing, West Denmark.
Last year Vestas - including its associated company Spanish Gamesa Eolica - 
increased its market share to 32 percent of the world market from 29 percent 
in 1999, cementing its position as the world`s leading wind turbine maker 
ahead of German Enercon and Danish NEG Micon . 
According to Danish windpower consultancy BTM Germany installed 1,665 
megawatts of wind capacity in 2000 followed by Spain`s 1,024 MW while 
installed capacity worldwide rose 15 percent to 4,495 MW. 
""We regard growth in the German market as stable in coming years and expect 
growth to continue in Spain,"" Poulsen said. 
To meet the German wind turbine demand Vestas said it would build a turbine 
blade factory in either Germany, Poland or Hungary, with a final decision on 
which country to be announced at the company`s general meeting on May 3, 
Poulsen said.. 
Today the company has seven factories in Denmark and one in Germany, Italy 
and India. In Spain, Vestas indirectly owns 10 plants through its 40 percent 
owned wind turbine firm Gamesa Eolica, part of Spanish Gamesa Group . 
Vestas will also soon build an tower construction and assembly plant in 
Scotland, Poulsen said. 
Vestas expected wind power installations worldwide to leap 30 percent 
annually over the next three years and with the company`s expectations of 
annually sales growth at 40 percent, Vestas is set to gain market share. 
FOCUS ON THE U.S. 
Following Germany and Spain, the U.S. is seen as the third-largest wind 
turbine market in 2001, but new orders have come to a halt as windpark 
developers await an extension of the favourable production tax credit 
agreement (PTC), which expires by the end of 2001. 
Last week U.S. President George W. Bush in his fiscal 2002 budget proposed 
expanding the 1.5-cent tax credit for each kilowatt-hour of electricity 
produced from wind for three more years to 2004. 
""It`s positive the Bush Administation favours PTC. Now it seems more certain 
an extension will happen,"" Johannes Polusen said. 
BTM predicted in a recent report the U.S. would install 1,350 MW this year, 
falling to 800 MW next year and 1000 MW in 2003, assuming that the U.S. did 
not extend the PTC agreement. The figures would be significantly higher if 
the tax credit was extended, a BTM analyst said. 
According to the monthly magazine Renewable Energy World, the American Wind 
Energy Association forecasts 2,000 MW of new wind turbine installations in 
the U.S. this year. 
""We do not expect more huge orders from the U.S. until late this year as 
customers are awaiting an approval of the tax proposal, but we might get a 
few small orders,"" Poulsen said. 
Vestas has plans of a blade and assembly plant in the U.S. ready in case the 
tax credit deal is extended, he said. 
Poulsen rejected the idea of acquiring U.S. energy group Enron`s wind turbine 
arm Enron Wind Corp. with a world market share of six percent, which 
according to market sources has been put up for sale. 
""To control the massive market growth we have to grow organically,"" Poulsen 
said.

USA: Bandwidth trade struggles to gain footing.
By David Howard Sinkman

04/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Hailed as a new frontier for financial 
markets, bandwidth trading is struggling to get a footing as capacity piles 
up, prices fall and expectations float back to earth. 
A supply glut, especially on long distance routes between large cities, is 
dragging down prices and investment on new capacity has slowed considerably 
as demand flags. But trading will pick up in two to three years as the market 
matures, say analysts.
""There is nothing going on out there. The business is viable, but we are 
ahead of the curve,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. 
Bandwidth is the transmission capacity of an electronic line used to send 
data from one point to another, as on the Internet. The trading of bandwidth 
helps facilitates deals and hedges against risk. 
While the bandwidth market was all the rage the previous three years, this 
year has seen a fallout in the industry. 
Enron Corp., billed as the biggest bandwidth trader, said April 6 it would 
cut 20 percent of the jobs at its broadband unit because of slow demand for 
streaming media products to personal computers. 
""There will be some shake-out in demand, growth and pricing, but long-term 
demand and growth will be there,"" said Seth Libby, analyst at consulting firm 
The Yankee Group. 
MARKET FAILURES 
Market inefficiencies, such as unresolved issues like credit and market 
enforcement, have retarded trading. 
What is needed, according to San Francisco-based online exchange RateXchange 
Corp. , is a standardized contract that would provide the framework for 
commodity-like trading. 
Without such agreement, buyers and sellers of bandwidth need to agree on new 
terms for each transaction, said Michael Rose, RateXchange's director of 
business development. 
""We do not yet have a fully functioning market,"" said Rose. 
However, analysts liken today's trading market to the power market, which 
took more 10 years to get off the ground. 
""Today's market problems are just growing pains,"" said Rod Kuckro, managing 
editor of the Bandwidth Market Report, which is published by McGraw Hill Co. 
Kuckro sees growth picking up over the next three years. 
FALLOUT 
Market inefficiencies are not the only problem bandwidth trading faces. A 
supply glut has dragged down prices. 
Exact numbers are hard to come by in the bandwidth trading market. But 
industry experts say only about 10 percent, or even less, of existing fiber 
optic capacity for bandwidth is lit, or in use in the United States. 
""Obviously there is some capacity problems out there. And there will be 
funding problems going forward,"" said Credit Lyonnais Securities analyst 
Gordon Howald. 
It is now cheaper to buy or lease lines than to take the risk of digging in 
the ground and laying new lines. 
As a result companies are not investing as much in construction. For example, 
Enron slashed its capital spending on its fiber optic network to about $250 
million this year from an earlier estimated budget of $750 million. 
Demand for capacity has also fallen short of expectations. 
""The traditional bandwidth business plan read 'just build it and they will 
come,' but this did not pan out,"" said Libby. 
Consequently, today's market has more sellers than buyers. And as new players 
enter the market, like Global Crossing Ltd. and energy companies Dominion 
Resources and Dynegy Inc. , competition has heated up. 
But this might just be what the doctor ordered. 
As prices keep falling, carriers, who were reluctant to embrace bandwidth 
trading, are taking a long-look because of the increased efficiencies offered 
by trading. 
""Somewhat perversely, this fallout might hasten trading as companies are 
forced to compete more fiercely with new players,"" said Kuckro. 
LAST MILE HURDLE 
Think of driving from New York to Washington. The highway is mostly free of 
congestion, but traffic jams abound in the cities. 
The same holds true for bandwidth connections. Bottlenecks in the last mile 
have kept prices high, despite a glut in long-haul capacity and unused 
dark-fibers 
Bandwidth trading, which does not always provide a loop-to-loop service, 
suffers as a result. 
""Nobody want to buy long-haul capacity and then haggle and worry about the 
local loop,"" warns Seth Libby, who said he is unaware of any bandwidth trades 
that included the final link. 
However, analyst see the last mile problem as just another hurdle bandwidth 
trading will get around to deal with. 
""Somebody is going to step up to plate,"" said Libby. 
While analysts expect the majority of bandwidth deals to remain 
carrier-to-carrier, the trading market is expected to blossom as the kinks in 
the system get ironed out. 
""Everyone is dressed for a party, but there is no party to go to yet,"" said 
Donato Eassey. ""But once we get the paths and the customers down the party 
starts.""

BRAZIL: INTERVIEW-BG claims Brazil pipeline war victory.
By Andrei Khalip

04/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 18 (Reuters) - Britain's BG Group Plc claims to have 
won a ""litmus test"" battle in Brazil by gaining access to a key natural gas 
pipeline, which marks a big step to a free market and a defeat for 
ex-monopoly Petrobras. 
BG's director for corporate affairs in southern South America, Francois 
Moreau, said the final decision earlier this week by the energy regulatory 
body ANP to allow BG to use the Bolivia-Brazil pipeline in 2001-2003 was an 
important victory, although not all of BG's demands were met.
BG has big expansion plans for its Brazilian distribution affiliate Comgas 
and the long-awaited access to the line that brings natural gas from BG's own 
production fields in Bolivia is crucial for the realization of those plans. 
""The ANP has confirmed that it wants the private initiative to have a greater 
role in the energy sector, that it stands for a competitive market and is 
ready to fight Petrobras. We view it as a test case for an open market in 
Brazil,"" Moreau said. 
The ANP already authorized U.S.-based Enron Corp. to use the pipeline, but 
only when it had idle capacity. Analysts now expect Enron and other companies 
to follow BG's suit and demand uninterrupted use of the pipeline. 
Under the present deal, BG is allowed to import 24.5 million cubic feet 
(700,000 cubic meters) of gas per day from April to August, and from 
September until the end of 2002 it can import 73.5 million cubic feet (2.1 
million cubic meters). 
The ANP's decision initially came out last month, but TBG, the gas 
transportation unit of Brazil's state-owned oil company Petrobras which 
operates the line, rushed to challenge it, insisting that it had no free 
capacity. 
""Petrobras sees the transportation as means to protect its monopoly. Even the 
ANP admits that there are elements of anti-competition actions in what they 
are doing,"" Moreau claimed. 
Petrobras officials said they had no comment on the issue. ANP said Petrobras 
could appeal to a court, but there was no way the ANP would review its 
decision. 
ANP president David Zylbersztajn told reporters on Wednesday that he saw the 
issue as closed and the parties involved would have to sign a contract in a 
week's time. 
He did not rule out fresh resistance from Petrobras, but warned that his 
agency was determined to tame the state energy giant that officially lost its 
monopoly rights in oil and gas production and distribution in 1997. 
""ANP's game is to crush this resistance,"" he said. 
Despite the important victory, BG has lost its own latest appeal with the 
ANP. The company had wanted a firm deliveries regime to last until end-2003, 
but the agency ruled that after 2002, TBG may interrupt deliveries on ANP's 
permission. 
However, Moreau said that he was now pinning his hopes on a new set of rules 
for gas transportation that the ANP is preparing and should release in May. 
Those were expected to limit Petrobras' role in the future expansion of the 
gas transportation system, provide more transparency in striking contracts 
for delivery and, in general, bring more healthy competition to the market. 
He said that in his view, demand for natural gas in Brazil was likely to rise 
with time, requiring a 50 percent expansion of the Bolivia-Brazil pipeline 
that now can carry 1.1 billion cubic feet (30 million cubic meters) of gas 
per day. 
Brazil aims to boost the share of natural gas in its energy market to 10-12 
percent by 2010 from the present fledgling 3 percent by encouraging the 
construction of gas-fired electric energy plants to alleviate the country's 
heavy dependence on hydroelectric plants and by greater industrial use of 
gas. 
Moreau said BG was interested in taking part in any expansion projects, both 
of the pipeline and of the network inside Brazil, as well as signing more 
long-term transportation contracts ""if the environment is competitive."" 
BG is already building a pipeline to transport gas from Argentina to southern 
Brazil, where it will be linked to an existing pipeline and carry gas to 
Comgas' base of Sao Paulo - Brazil's main industrial hub and richest state. 
Moreau said the group, which bought Comgas two years ago for nearly $1 
billion, planned to triple Comgas' sales of 6 million cubic meters of gas per 
day three years from now and boost them 10-fold by 2011.

Enron India Sends Arbitration Notices To State Govt

04/18/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- In the ongoing tussle between the Dabhol Power Co., 
India's Maharashtra state government, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
and the government of India, DPC Wednesday served two notices of arbitration 
on the Maharashtra government, its spokesman said. 
A subsidiary of U.S. energy major Enron Corp. (ENE), DPC has a controlling 
65% stake in the controversial $2.4 billion joint-venture 2,184-megawatt 
electric power project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, which 
supplies power to the MSEB. The project is India's biggest foreign 
investment.
In a faxed company statement, Enron India spokesman Jimmy Mogul said the 
notices were served because the Maharashtra government had failed ""to honor 
its obligations under the government of Maharashtra State Support Agreement 
and Supplemental State Support Agreement,"" signed in 1994 and 1996, 
respectively. 
DPC said that in the agreements, GoM had pledged to ""support and encourage 
the further development and completion of the Dabhol project."" It added that 
""without justification"" the GoM has gone back on these agreements, which has 
""adversely and materially impacted DPC's ability to perform under its 
contractual agreements."" 
The statement added that as part of the arbitration process, an independent 
three-person panel will be set up to determine whether GoM has ""failed to 
comply with its obligations."" 
Under a 1996 counter guarantee agreement, the federal government is obliged 
to pay Enron when MSEB defaults. Enron invoked that guarantee in February, 
marking the first time in India's history that a company has invoked a 
federal guarantee, when the state utility said it couldn't afford to pay DPC. 
The state government finally paid $17 million in outstanding bills. 
DPC and the federal government recently started a conciliation process, to be 
governed by the provisions of the U.N. Commission on International Trade Law, 
with the aim of resolving DPC's latest dispute with MSEB. DPC says MSEB owes 
it 1.02 billion rupees ($1=INR46.8550) for power supplied in December 2000. 
For its part, the MSEB said it wanted the power bill offset against a INR4 
billion fine it levied on DPC for what it said was the non-supply of power 
for intermittent periods between October 2000 and the end of January. 
Dabhol, India's largest private power plant currently under construction, was 
scheduled for commissioning in two phases. The project's first phase, a 
740-megawatt power plant, has already been commissioned and phase two is due 
to be completed later this year. 
Critics object to Dabhol charging INR7.1 a kilowatt-hour for its power, 
compared with INR1.5/KWh charged by other suppliers.

understanding of our view of the problem and the solutions.  She also spent 
time asking me how I thought other players would respond to the IOU request

She expects to have a ""big picture"" story--covering AB 1890s past, present & 
future--completed in the next couple of weeks.  In Rebecca's words, she wants 
the story to ""shake things up.""  She's very upset with how the utilities are 
handling it.  I told her we were less concerned with ""he said/she said"" and 
more concerned with finding real short and long term solutions that are fair 
to everyone.

Mark and Karen:  In my long history with Rebecca, it has always been 
understood that our conversations are off the record and background.  
Invariably, at the end of the conversation, Rebecca tells me that she intends

Removing Market Transparency - Still need FERC to take action
Development of Forwards Market and Risk Management - Great results
Removing distortions on Prices - Wrong action
Ending Cal ISO / Cal PX Stakeholder Boards - Great results

On the risk management issue, FERC itself said ""The single most important 
remedy that California market needs is the elimination of rules that prevent 
market participants from managing risk"". [FERC PRESS RELEASE]

366,"Dear fellow students,

As classes are about to end for the semester, we will be asked to complete
Instructor Evaluations Forms for each class taken. The evaluations are one
of the most effective tools we have as students to ensure the quality of
instruction remains high and our tuition dollars are used effectively. Both
the Student Advisory Committee and the Evening MBA Association work hard to
improve the program but our efforts become difficult when those professors
whom students felt were not up to par receive high marks.

The evaluations are used in deciding whether to invite instructors back to
the program. Club 6 is an elite group of professors that have received a
median evaluation of 6.0 or better. Students should consider a rating of 6
as a sign of an outstanding teacher. This will allow us to truly reward and
distinguish the professors that stand out.

Please keep the following in mind when considering the Instructor Evaluation
Forms.

1. Courses taught by multiple professors require multiple evaluations. Not
all instructors add the same value and we should recognize this. Please
differentiate your evaluations being specific about each professor and
his/her specific strenghts and weaknesses.

2. Some classes are more 'fun' than others. Please keep in mind that the
form clearly distingushes between the course strenghts and the instructor's
effectiveness in teaching the course. While some classes are not so popular,
the professors teaching those courses might be truly outstanding.

3. Many people reported to us that they did not have a reference scale to
guide them in making evaluation decisions. Keep in mind that 6 is considered
an above average performanace. The following is the reference scale provided
a while back. Please bring it to class or keep it in mind when evaluating
the faculty.

1 - Soo bad, it's less than 2
2 - So bad, it's less than 3
3 - Class had many critical faults. This instructor should not be
invited again unless major changes are made
4 - Class had some critical shortcomings, this instructor should be
invited again after some adjustments
5 - A good course, instructor in line with expectation for HAAS
instructors
6 - Excellent course, instructor generally superior to MOST other
instructors previously had
7 - Outstanding/walks on water

COLUMBUS, Ohio--The Dayton Power and Light Co. on Thursday received final=

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio endorsed DP&L's transition plan tha=

Utility deregulation is a trend across the nation as state regulators seek =

lower prices for electricity, telephone and natural gas by replacing=20
monopolies with competition. Under deregulation, electric service is divide=
d=20
three ways--generation, transmission and local distribution.

DP&L's three-year plan, versus five years for most Ohio utilities, places a=
=20
ceiling on the cost customers pay for electric generation for three years=

while fixing transmission charges for six years.

Customers will have the choice of shopping for electric power from various=

Names of potential competitors have not been identified.

Those who select a new power supplier will have the electricity delivered=

After three years, DP=02=14will have no restrictions on what it may charge =

or sell assets without PUCO approval.

However, competition from new suppliers is expected to keep electric rates=
=20
under control, according to Robert S. Tongren, Ohio Consumers' Counsel.

""The new generation (capacity) being proposed and built right now in the=20
state of Ohio is gigantic,"" Tongren said. ""It is huge.""

He said California experienced post-deregulation price spikes during a rece=
nt=20
heat wave because the state is across mountains and can't tap into the U.S.=

power grid. In addition, he said price controls make it unattractive for=20
companies to build new generating plants.

Tongren said his office helped write the DP=02=14transition plan and endors=

PUCO Chairman Alan Schriber said the plan ""provides an opportunity to=20

Dennis Montali 
Bankruptcy Judge Faces Challenge of His Career 
Well-known expert in complex cases 
Harriet Chiang, Chronicle Legal Affairs Writer
Saturday, April 7, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/07/M
N180032.DTL 
A veteran federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco now is calling the shots 
in California's long, drawn-out power crisis. 
Judge Dennis Montali has spent eight years helping financially ailing dot- 
coms, consumers and corporations get back on their financial feet. Now he is 
about to take on the biggest case of his career, and lawyers say that he is 
relishing the challenge. 
""He's one of the best judges in the country,"" said Lawrence Goldberg, a San 
Francisco bankruptcy lawyer with Goldberg, Stinnett, Meyers & Davis. ""He 
loves his job and he loves this kind of combat when lawyers come to court."" 
Montali, 60, has built a reputation as a hard-working, enthusiastic judge who 
often knows the facts of a case better than the lawyers. He is a scholar of 
bankruptcy law, having lectured and written law review articles. The more 
complicated the case, lawyers say, the more energized he becomes. 
On a personal level, he can strike the fine balance between the demands of 
the commercial world and the plight of the consumer trying to overcome a 
mountain of credit card debts, lawyers say. 
""He's an excellent draw for the case,"" said bankruptcy lawyer Shawn 
Christianson, with Buchalter, Nemer, Fields & Younger. She said that Montali 
has a combination of pragmatism, intellect and experience that will help him 
understand the problems of all those involved in this statewide crisis. 
Tall and lanky with a handle-bar mustache, Montali is a native of the Bay 
Area. Born in San Francisco, his father worked as a liquor distributor and 
later founded Montali Winery -- later Audubon Cellars -- in Berkeley. The 
young Montali earned his undergraduate degree from Notre Dame University and 
then entered the Navy to fulfill a Reserve Officers Training Corps 
commitment. 
After his discharge in 1965, he entered the University of California's Boalt 
School of Law in Berkeley and earned his law degree in 1968. 
He joined the law firm of 
Rothschild and Phelan in San Francisco and quickly developed a specialty in 
bankruptcy law. By the time he joined the legal giant Pillsbury, Madison & 
Sutro in 1980 he was an established expert. 
While he represented debtors early on in his career, he became a creditor's 
attorney at Pillsbury and quickly built a national reputation for his 
knowledge and his active role in the bankruptcy law community. 
In 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco chose him for an opening 
on the federal bankruptcy court in Northern California. 
One of two bankruptcy judges in San Francisco, he has become an expert in 
doing emergency surgery on companies in critical condition, able to deal with 
crises quickly and with few complications. 
He has gained national prominence as a member of the National Conference of 
Bankruptcy Judges and the American College of Bankruptcy. He also was 
rewarded with an appointment to the bankruptcy appellate panel. 
When he's not bailing out a company, he spends his off hours cooking Italian 
food at his Berkeley home with his wife, Mary. He also loves to sail, walk 
his dog and spend time with his granddaughter. 
""He's going to put his heart into this one,"" said Larry Engel, a veteran 
bankruptcy lawyer with San Francisco's Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. ""He's got 
the respect of everyone in terms of his fairness and diligence."" 
""California,"" he added, ""is in really good hands in having the case with 
him.""

Also, keep in touch with how the issues go with them, since they are clearly trying to use the reg. issues as leverage, and in that regard, often offering up worst-case scenarios.

We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter=
 months.

First:
With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp. We will have to carefu=
lly manage the units to prevent ""swinging"" them and increasing the chance o=
f a unit outage. As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the u=
nit commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-l=
ine and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back. Recently we have sold =
energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual=
 (Newman 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensivel=
y in the market. Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they hav=
e a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their mark=
eting group. We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going for=
ward, but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be mat=
ched either in-house or by other marketers. I look to each member of the gr=
oup to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as =
efficiently as possible.

Second:
The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest. It will become very=
 difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10. We should =
look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC. Also, as lights and hea=
ters come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 =
through HE 20. Enron Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours. B=
e sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in=
 with ECC.

Finally:
We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(=
the first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews a=
nd the final two months of the year.

Please see me with any questions regarding the system.

Thank you.

423,"Guys, I would like to add the following commentary to the DASH which will 
better reflect my thinking around this investment.  The current text suggests 
that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in 
the fund.  I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in 
the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.  I would 
suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following:

 It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an 
effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant   
investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is 
important for the following reasons:
  a) provides an additional ""Friend of Enron"" to facilitate short to medium 
term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured    commodity 
and capital transactions in the wholesale group;
  b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and
  c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral 
benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.

ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor 
and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.

their RFP with our suggested language or documents.  It would be helpful for 
the commercial team in ENA/EES to meet with these gentlemen and their

 The proposal includes:

  b) unit contigent tolls from Pastoria (750MW) and Las Vegas Cogen (222MW) 
for term;
  c) natural gas packages for size for one through five year terms to provide

As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.",,,Enron FAA the U.S. Department of State Corporate Security Travel Agency

PROS Revenue Management's Energy Web Seminar Series 
a ""Resounding Success""

December 10, 2001-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in revenue management science and software, and the pioneer and dominant provider of revenue management to the airline and energy industries, today announced the success of its Energy Profit Optimization Web Seminar Series held December 5-7, 2001.  Each seminar in the series discussed the benefits of PROS commercial optimization systems in the natural gas industry.  Each seminar included case studies which provided participants an insight to the practical applications of PROS science-based optimization systems.  Focused on pipelines, storage, and trading, these seminars enabled participants from various areas of the energy industry to take advantage of pricing and revenue optimization best practices.  

""These seminars were a resounding success,"" says Matt Johnson, PROS' Senior VP of Energy.  ""PROS is continuing to take the leadership role for transfer of our mature revenue management science and technology into the energy industry.  Based on the positive feedback of key energy first-movers, we anticipate several more of these innovative, interactive seminars in 2002.  These sessions allowed attendees to have access to free, informative business case studies reflecting state-of-the-art energy revenue management.""

The PROS Trading Optimization System can increase gas trading profitability by 10-15% by generating the optimal routing of supply to market given all pipeline contract constraints, gas purchase and sale obligations, and trading opportunities. The system recommends optimal spot gas buy/sell strategies and provides real-time physical position and opportunity cost data between any two points on the pipeline network. The result is the reduction of the gas scheduling process to less than 60 seconds.

The PROS Storage Revenue Management System has been shown to increase revenues from the sale of storage capacity by 7-25% after initial implementations.  This system provides pipelines, storage marketers and traders with the ability to maximize revenue from the sale of storage services and contracts.  It provides the comprehensive ability to analyze the value of storage using PROS' state-of-the-art revenue management science and to execute and track those deals in real-time.  

The PROS Transportation Revenue Management System has demonstrated a revenue lift of 7-15% for firm transportation services in both open-season and negotiated sales environments. It allows natural gas pipelines to maximize revenue from the sale of transportation capacity. The system uses PROS' mature forecasting technology to predict demand for transportation contracts and forecast the customer utilization of existing contracts. PROS' price modeling and network optimization technology is used to provide pipeline capacity marketers with an optimal marketing plan that maximizes revenue from the sale of available capacity.


These products are based on the PROS Enterprise RM Platform, which uses world leading science, forecasting and optimization to generate revenue and profits for PROS' clients worldwide. The Platform is high performance, distributed computing, using parallelized, highly scalable technology.  This architecture will support the high performance, high availability, real time, and mission critical applications of our clients.  PROS' advanced architecture supports data intensive and calculation intensive, science-based enterprise solutions.

PROS 9th Annual Pricing and Revenue Optimization Conference will be March 3-7, 2002.  This premiere event will feature industry leaders participating in presentations, panel discussions, and product workshops. Join industry colleagues, academics, and representatives from the international business community at large to discuss relevant topics specific to the energy industry and to the practice of revenue management.

Gas control has some line work scheduled for 1/4,5,6 that will affect the

they'll want baseload for January.  The desk also appears to have some gas 
nom'd out here (approx 1200mm).   Rather than cut these volumes, would you 
try to negotiate with Koch not to flow this gas during the outage, but to 
make it up as soon as the outage is over (they may be able to begin flow on 
1/6)?  Please let me know as soon as possible.

474,"Daren, per review of the Gas agreements between Tenaska IV and 
Williams/Apache and our understanding of the Agency agreement, I had a few 
items I  wanted to discuss with you (in lieu of our meeting today that was 
cancelled):

1. Looking at the October gas supply to the plant, I think Tenaska IV should 
have been charged at the contract prices with Williams & Apache (i.e.  2.285) 
and not at what the final price that was actualized per Megan's summary - 
230,406 at $710,616.70, price of $3.084.  If this volume was charged  at 
2.285 the total would have been $526,477.71, a difference of $184,138.99.

2. Looking at the November gas supply to the plant, Tenaska IV was charged 
$2.91 per MMbtu, instead of $2.285 for volumes of 267,300.  At the $2.91  
price, the total settlement price was $777,843 instead of $610,780.50 at 
2.285, showing a difference of $167,062.50.

I reviewed the gas supply agreements and the Williams gas price (pg. 19) for 
2000 gas is 2.32, which can be adjusted by the Waha Transportation Adjustment 
if delivered at Waha.  This adjustment started in 1997 at $.03 per MMbtu and 
increase by 5% per year.  Thereby currently, the adjustment factor is at 
.0347, giving us a price of $2.2853 per MMbtu.

In reviewing the Apache gas agreement (pg. 22), I noticed that the gas price 
is 2.285 at Waha & 2.315 at Katy/Carthage for 2000.  Per review of the Apache 
invoices, it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at 
other places (i.e. Lomak-Sterling & Mendell CDP) at a price of $2.175.  If 
Enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a 
margin difference then that is upside to Enron.  However, I think the plant 
should not be charged above the contract price of $2.285.

Looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for November and 
October, I did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from 
Williams and Apache of 45,000 MMbtu per day.  Therefore I don't think spot 
prices are part of the equation here.  Additionally, I recall from our 
meeting last month that all Enron makes on this deal is the Agency Fee of 
$.04 per MMbtu (excluding the margin difference that Enron has on Apache gas 
delivery points if my scenario above is correct).

So based upon items 1 & 2 above, I am suggesting that Tenaska IV adjust their 
November invoice owed to Enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price 
differences showed above.  Therefore, I am planning to wire a payment of 
$484,234.03 (see breakout below) on Friday, 12/22, to Enron on behalf of 
Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. for this activity.

  Month   Plant Gas Price Amount
  November  267,300  2.91 $777,843 
  November adjustment    $(167,062.50)   
  October adjustment    $(184,138.99)
  Nov. Agency Fee 1,350,000 .04 $54,000
  Sept. Agency Fee 98,813  .04 $3,592.52
       Total $484,234.03

I discussed these issues with Mike Mazowita, Rick Hill & Jody Pierce before 
reaching this conclusion.  Should you have any different ideas or thoughts 
that I am not covering, please call me at 3-7280 and we can discuss.  Thanks.

Here's the response I got with regards to Tomcat. I've place another call 
into David and let him know that the information we received included most 
points except for Tomcat. I'll keep you informed. 

What I know is that the gas is sourced at MI 587 and moved on KM's firm 
contract. For as long as CES remembers, they sell the gas to Entex. Entex 
chooses the pipe off which they take--usually Midcon--also, HPL Channel, or 
Tejas. KM is invoiced directly. Volume is approx. 2395. The deal with Entex 
is written up monthly. KM pays on a basket of indices. Entex pays on the 
highest index.

Koch never returned my calls. Based on the contractual information, we may be 
putting ourselves in a risk area by 'assigning' the deals without proper 
documentation. The documentation that was supplied did not refence any ENA 
agreements, nor any specific meter numbers. If the purchase was indeed a 
meter/well sale; there should be documentation listing the meters acquired 
and the effective date. Since we are apparently the supplier, the risk is not 
as substaintial as if we were the purchaser. However, without documentation 
we are basically relying on the relationship btw Koch & Duke.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

he was in the middle of a ""big drafting project""--revising Dennis' joint 
venture agreement with the Isleta.  I took the opportunity to express my 
concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, 
including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board.  
I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline 
or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit 
turbines.   Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron 
or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with 
money, turbines, etc.   If Enron does eventually decide to get into this 
deal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be 
revisited.   Thanks for your patience on this project.  DF",Tino Monaldo Dennis Langley's Bill Tino Jim Slattery Rick Harrington Harrington Dennis Isleta,,"Enron Dennis, Tino DOE/DOD ENA"

563,"PNM to Buy Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources

Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both
companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will
acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free,
stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western
Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE
subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n
named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, 
Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including
its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into 
Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders.

Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated
equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including
conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new
holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western
Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of
approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total
enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9
billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for
as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's
earnings per share and cash flow.",,"approximately $1.503 billion approximately $2.939 billion $4.442 billion approximately $6.5 billion $2.6 billion $3.9

566,"In the last several weeks several areas have come up where the TW commercial 
team could, in my opinion, use some clear written guidance on gray areas 
under the tariff ought to be interpreted.  Here is my list.  Please add items 
if I've missed any.

1.  When can TW ""selectively market"" available capacity?   I.e., if capacity 
is on the board as available, and no one has bought it, are there any limits 
on calling up a customer, or a group of customers, and pitching a deal?  I 
think we have a lot of discretion here--after all, using the telephone to 
talk to one customer is always ""selective"" since there's only one guy on the 
phone, not all our customers.  Also, can we deliberately leave a customer off 
the list of ""the usual suspects"" we call to pitch a special deal like an 
index to index deal or a discount?  I've asked Lee to pull together a quick 
analysis of this issue.  

2.  If we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open 
season context, how do we allocate it?  This is the situation we got into a 
couple of weeks ago on the '02 and '03 space.  Are we always required to use 
a lottery?  Do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata, or can we use 
pro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance?

3.  What approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate 
contracts?  The ET&S discount approval procedure still applies to TW 
discounted deals (even there is no ET&S anymore).  I think all neg. rate 
deals should be approved by law and regulatory, but I don't need to see max 
rate strd language deals.    
4.  ???  I think there was another issue, but I can't remember what it was.

576,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

contract 32075 for Dynegy / Friskies. Of this 403 Dth Friskies only wants 251
Dth nominated for Jan 1 forward.  This release is good for Jan only and will 
of
course cause the MDQ on contract 250 to go down by 250.

On :  Midcoast - Also for Friskies/Dynegy we released 400 Dth from Midcoast
contract 6005 and created a contract numbered 7010 for Jan specifically for
deliveries to Friskies.  This will cause the MDQ on contract 6005 to decrease
by 400 Dth.


On :  Tennessee  - We released 1,642 Dth from Huntsville contract number 507
and created contract 32076 for Wolverine deliveries to the Midcoast/Tenn
interconnect.  This looks to be a Jan only contract number and must be used so
that Wolverine quantities can be recognized.  This causes contract 507 to go
down by the amount of the release.

On:  Midcoast - We released 1,629 Dth from Huntsville contract 6009 and 
created
contract 7010 for Wolverine deliveries behind the DECATUR city gate.  This 
will
cause the MDQ on contract 6009 to go down by 1,629.

598,"With the implementation of SAP, the employee expense report form has been 
modified to reflect the new coding system.  The procedures for its use are 
unchanged, but there are some cosmetic differences.  One item to note: the 
form no longer requires entry of your Social Security Number; instead use 
your new personnel number assigned through Human Resources (see 
http://hrweb.enron.com).  For electronically submitted expense reports, enter 
the same number on the receipt envelope.

The form is now available at the SAP website.  To access the form:

 From the Enron home page, go to the SAP intranet site http://sap.enron.com
 Choose one of the following paths:
 Click on Quick Reference Tools on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form

  Click on Forms and Procedures Library on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form
 Wait for it to load
 Click Enable Macros (or Yes, allow macros)

After you enter the data, save as Excel Workbook (.xls file extension) with a 
new filename.  Do not save as Excel Template (.xlt extension).

You may print the spreadsheet for submission to Accounts Payable, or attach 
it to Notes for electronic submission.  Instructions are available at the 
website, on the same drop down box as the form.

I have not had a chance to look at the other house - the sq footage seems really small though.  Based on what I've seen over the last 8 months, it would take something around $190's - $205's to make me happy and I'm not willing to spend that much right now.

Another thing that bothers me is the economy.  All I hear about are layoffs.  The only industry still booming is the energy industry and we keep streamlining.  That's what keeps me from spending the big bucks on a house.

Notice to all Appalachian Pool Operators:           Received 3/29/00  2:00 pm
Reclassification Notice                            Posted 3/29/00  2:00 pm

On February 10, 1999, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549, granting CNG 
Transmission's (CNGT's) request for reclassification of various transmission 
lines to gathering lines.  As part of that Docket, several transmission lines 
were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to 
further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.   
On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting 
reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines.  
The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, 
H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, 
CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective 
April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff 
sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff 
sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel 
retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have 
questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at 
(304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.

Dear Pool Operator:

 CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings 
Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance 
starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires 
that the ""wet gas"" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.  
The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no 
unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations 
are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions 
concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed 
to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.

 Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets 
other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. 
on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations 
to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight 
and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per 
CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT 
considering 
the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your 
pool.

 As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult 
to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your 
pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's 
local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators 
notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify 
producers individually.

 We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted 
to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us 
to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled 
shut       down will not be until 2002.

 If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to 
contact me at (304) 623-8698. 

      Sincerely,



      Nancy M. Aucremanne
      Manager, Producer Services
      And Business Agreements

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

We have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north. Right now 
Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule 12MW on the tie so do not try to 
schedule any more (The tie is only good for 17MW).

- Either do a export from SP15 to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at 
Silverpeak(From PV or FC).
- Buy transmission from SPP from  (www.swoasis.com ) CONTROL TO HILLTOP. 
($6.90 on-peak, $3.90 off-peak)
- Buy transmission from PAC from MAL2 TO MAL5. ($5.84)
- Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account 
numbers below).

We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin. 

THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY 
ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS 
SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. Call and confirm the request with both PAC 
and Sierra.



Also do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do 
not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I 
guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want 
competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they 
are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  

It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can.
If you have any questions over the weekend call me.

I wanted to passback some important feedback from the Enron Canada group 
concerning our notes on restatements.  In the notes section of the calgary 
website (see my previous email), we need to input the mws dispatched in EVERY 
call we have.  Enron Canada considers it very important that we have every 
call in the log.  For example:

Entry #1; 01:33...Gary at Powerpool called to dispatch us up to 358 mws from 
352 mws, Transalta excess energy now in merit.
Entry #2; 01:34...Joe at Transalta Plant, called Joe and had him go to 358 
from 352 mws.

and then later on in the evening.

Entry #3; 03:21...Gary at Powerpool called to dispatch us down to 352 mws 
from 358 mws, Transalta excess energy no longer in merit order.
Entry #4; 03:22...Joe at Transalta Plant, called Joe and had him go to 352 
mws from 358mws.

So basically we need to say the time and mws for each call, and whether or 
not the excess energy (anything over 353 MWhs) is in or out of merit.
We also need to be sure to identify restatements because of plant derates, as 
well as the cause of the derate.  This information is VERY important to our 
custormer (Enron Canada) for settlements and payments to Transalta.  
Consequently it should be important to us.  You should all be familiar with 
the systems by now.  If you have any questions, please ask me.  I would like 
to prove our competency on these issues.

Thank you.

665,"At various times during the recent scramble to cope with the California 
crisis, we found ourselves shaking our heads in disbelief, often saying 
something like:  ""can you believe this? two months ago, we had no idea the PX 
would be melted down!""  We have tremendous resilience in responding to sudden 
legal emergencies, but I am wondering if there is any way we can pro-actively 
plan for what is almost certain to be a further extension of this crisis in 
the west.  I have just come out of a Portland floor meeting where a number of 
presentations were made, one of which was by Tim Heizenrader, our 
fundamentals guru, on the hydro situation in the west.  This is the driest 
year in a hundred years. In a few months we are going to have the equivalent 
of all the nuculear plants in the west shutting down on the same day.   

It is hard to not get kind of hysterical about this legally.  Do we just have 
to sit here like the proverbial deer with this bright light shining in our 
eyes, or is there something we can do to prepare?  If we could have seen the 
first phase of the California crisis, what might we have done differently?  
We can clearly see another phase coming at us, but what do do now, while we 
have all this time, is the big quetion.  I honestly think we should give this 
some priority now, while we may have time to do something about it.   

The reason I think we should engage our better minds on this now is, that I 
tested the traders out on this a time or two (not Tim, who usually thinks a 
lot more strategically than others) and the basic answer they give to the 
question:  what are we going to do if BPA can't deliver us our firm power?""  
is:  ""Oh, we've sold it as firm, if they don't deliver we have liquidated 
damages,  we'll be kept whole.""  This nonchalant answer is, at one level, the 
truth,  but, are we just going to shrug our shoulders and hope the LD's work 
out?   ",Tim Heizenrader Tim,,BPA

",John,,
668,"mark, an issues update:

1. timing issues--sithe has extended the time for potential tollers to give 
comments back on the tolling and related agreements until next friday, may 
12. final bids are not yet in and will probably be coming in as late as a 
week after that (may 19). we anticipate some real negotiation on the 
documentation and some issues that may be hard to resolve. our restructure 
document negotiations will be running a parallel path. this is a lot to 
accomplish, particularly with marty's torturous page-turning, wear you down 
negotiating style and the fact that he will be involved in all. marty has 
said he sees his june 1 date slipping.

2.bondholder issues--we have issues in addition to our consent issue that we 
have discussed. with respect to one of the transport pieces with transcanada, 
it signed a consent directly running to the bondholders that arguably it 
could be breaching if it consented to the assignment of the transport to us. 
marty's lawyer is clearly worried about this and transcanada is likely to at 
least ask for an indemnity from sithe and/or us. business guys are discussing 
splitting that risk 55 sithe/45 us, the partnership split under the proposed 
restructured deal. additionally, we have been asked to agree that the 
transport assigned to us is pledged to the bondholders and in essence agree 
that we will indemnify the bondholders directly if we do not make the 
transport contract payments. that number has potentially moved from $190 
million to a significantly larger number ($350 million???). seems like the 
toller may have some concern with bondholder  issues potentially in trying to 
protect itself during this long tolling period. this obviously could affect 
timing. bondholders are likely to have QF concerns as well (both on our side 
and with PECO). hard to tell what the business strategy is right now with 
respect to informing the bondholders about the transactions.

3.limitation on sithe liability--sithe served us very skinny documents, 
including no reps and warrranties except basically as to title, and those 
came from a shell subsidiary where it is dropping its interest (supposedly

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

	By telefax of November 21, Uriel Dutton of F&J provided a proposed waiver letter agreement for our review.  I will have copies of that proposed agreement circulated by hand-delivery and fax to all those on this list and to Mariner's GC.  At present,  I am not sending this e-mail to Mariner's GC. If there is someone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know.  

	Chuck and I have reviewed the letter, believe it to be overly broad, and hope that F&J is willing to negotiate further, along the following lines:

	1.  On page 1, third full paragraph, second line, we suggest inserting ""Enron Corp. and "" between ""representation of"" and ""Enron's affiliates"".

	2.  On page 4, paragraph (4), we are concerned about the third sentence, which reads as follows:  ""Enron Corp. agrees that it will cause each existing or future affiliate of Enron Corp. to comply with the agreements of the Enron Entities herein set forth.""  We think, although we do not know for sure, that F&J's concern is that F&J may become adverse in the future to some existing Enron entity that F&J does not currently represent,  or that does not currently exist, and that either of these two entities may seek to assert disqualification based on F&J's current representation of Enron entities.  If this is the reason for the sentence, we don't see how an existing Enron entity or future Enron entity could assert a conflict that has been waived by the Enron entity that is actually being represented.

	      We also have a concern about asking Enron Corp. to cause all of its ""affiliates"", as defined in the letter agreement, to comply with it.  Enron Corp. may not have the power to require all its ""affiliates"" to comply.  Our suggestion would be that this letter agreement be signed on behalf of all the actual Enron entities currently represented by F&J, including Mariner.

	 3.  On page 4, 17 lines from the top, we find objectionable the language that begins, ""Without limiting the foregoing...""  It seems to us that here, F&J wants all the Enron companies to be considered separately for disqualification purposes, and perhaps to be able to sue one Enron entity even though F&J is representing another Enron entity in a substantially related matter.

	3. On pages 4-5, paragraph (5), we have a concern about the third sentence, which reads as follows:  ""If Dynegy declines or fails to do so promptly after receipt of our request, it is expressly agreed and understood that F&J shall be entitled...""  Our concern is that we are committing Enron entities to an agreed course of action post-merger based on speculation as to what Dynegy may or may not do.  Our suggestion would be that we simply ask F&J to delete all but the first two sentences of paragraph (5).

	4.  Please note that under the terms of this proposed agreement, we are not requiring F&J to be liable for the ramp-up costs of new counsel for, e.g., the Licensing Project or the asbestosis cases (in the event that Enron Corp. cannot be dismissed from the asbestosis cases pre-trial).  We do not believe that ramp-up costs will be something F&J will agree to if we need F&J to take on the new Mariner matter.  Mariner's GC called me today to advise that it was urgent that she know today or tomorrow whether F&J was going to be able to represent Mariner on a new, critical asset-sale matter that is scheduled to close no later than December 27; otherwise, she will need to hire other counsel to handle that matter.

	Please let us have your comments as soon as possible.

CFTC Proposes Rules Implementing Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000
www.cftc.gov <http://www.cftc.gov> - March 6, 2001

Washington -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today
announced that it is proposing rules relating to trading facilities to
implement the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA). Congress,
on December 15, 2000, passed, and the President, on December 21, 2000,
signed into law, the CFMA, which substantially altered the Commodity
Exchange Act. The CFMA amended the law to establish three categories of
markets, designated contract markets, derivative transaction execution
facilities and markets exempt from CFTC regulation. The three categories
match the degree of regulation to the varying nature of the products and the
nature of the participant having access to the market.

The proposed new rules and rule amendments are being published in the
Federal Register for a 30-day comment period. The Commission, in its Federal
Register notice, urges commenters to submit their comments as early as
possible during the comment period so that the statutory changes may be
effectuated without delay.

Acting Chairman Newsome stated, ""Today's release of these proposed revisions
is an important step in fulfilling Congress's mandate to implement the
CFMA's provisions without delay. We look forward to a productive discussion
of this release over the next 30 days.""

Copies of these documents can be obtained by contacting the Office of the
Secretariat, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, N.W., Washington, DC
20581, (202) 418-5100 or by accessing the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission website.

CFTC Rule Proposal Would Establish Three-Tier Regulatory Regime for Markets
BNA - March 6, 2001

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission began the task of implementing the
2000 Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) by proposing a set of rules
March 5 aimed at making the commission more of an oversight agency than a
front-line regulator.

The rule proposal would implement the new statutory framework establishing
three new market categories, including exempt markets and two categories of
markets subject to CFTC regulatory oversight.

""The remaining parts of the framework relating to clearing organizations and
to intermediaries will be reproposed shortly,"" the agency stated.


Core Principles

The proposal establishes what the CFTC deems ""core principles"" that the
exchanges would operate under. It is meant to replace a ""one-size-fits-all""
regulatory scheme that critics say hampers the U.S. markets by making them
over-encumbered and plodding--unable to compete with a fast-shifting
international marketplace. Now, the exchanges will be segregated according
to who trades on them and what is sold, with varying degrees of oversight
for the different tiers.
The hope is that the exchanges with the most sophisticated traders will be
able to govern their own houses, with the CFTC staying clear of most
regulation. The proposals effectively replace rules that were passed in
December, but that were rendered moot and withdrawn when Congress later that
month passed similar legislation.

In effect, the proposed rules establish three tiers of oversight for the
various futures and options markets: designated contract markets,
derivatives transaction execution facilities, and exempt markets. The
designated contract markets are ""approved boards of trade or trading
facilities on which contracts for future delivery on any commodity may be
traded by any type of market participant,"" according to the CFTC's Federal
Register notice.

The next tier would consist of derivatives transaction execution facilities
and would be open to ""traders of futures and option contracts on commodities
that have a nearly inexhaustible delivery supply, are highly unlikely to be
susceptible to manipulation, have no cash market, and are security futures
products."" This tier would have an intermediate level of oversight,
according to the proposal.

Finally, commercial markets and boards of trade would be exempt, signifying
their relative sophistication in the markets.

Comments on the proposal are due 30 days after Federal Register publication.


Innovation, Competition

The announcement makes clear the CFTC's intention to go from front-line
regulator to a more behind-the-scenes oversight role. Since his appointment,
acting Chairman James Newsome has stressed his belief in free-market
principles and the idea that freeing the exchanges from over-zealous
oversight would help them compete in the global marketplace.
In its release, the commission said the proposal ""was intended to promote
innovation, maintain U.S. competitiveness, and at the same time reduce
systemic risk and protect customers."" The commission also said the proposal
would allow U.S. exchanges greater flexibility in competing with
technological innovations involving foreign competitors.

The proposal is the first portion of the 2000 CFMA to be taken up by the
commission. The legislation was passed in the waning moments of the previous
Congress, and it promises to drive much of the commission's agenda this
year.


Meyer Promotes Basel Committee Proposal
BNA - March 6, 2001
By Richard Cowden

Addressing a group of banking officials in Washington, D.C., March 5,
Federal Reserve Governor Laurence H. Meyer actively promoted the new
approach to international banking regulation represented by the recent
proposal for major revisions to the Basel Accord.

In remarks to the Institute of International Bankers, Meyer at once conceded
that the Jan. 16 proposal by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ""is
still very much a work in progress, with important issues still unresolved,""
while defending it as a necessary initiative to keep up with the times.

The 1988 Basel Accord has served its purpose, Meyer said. ""But technology
and business practices have moved on, and for the larger institutions this
decade-old rule has developed critical shortcomings. Risk-measurement
practices have improved, and capital markets have become more tightly
intertwined. Assumptions and shortcuts taken in the current accord are far
too crude, given practices today.""

A new regimen for setting international capital standards is needed, he
said, because many large, complex financial institutions today structure
portfolios to arbitrage around the existing standard, undercutting one of
the original intents of the Basel Accord to establish capital ratios that
reflect a bank's actual strength.

""Thus, we need a capital framework that is more risk-sensitive and
compatible with current market practices,"" Meyer said. ""Absolute levels of
capital must be consistent with risk in order not to shift risk-taking
either away from or to banks, but we also need a standard that better
reflects relative levels of risk.""

Meyer outlined the Basel Committee's proposal, which relies on a
""three-pillar"" approach, involving a new capital standard, heightened
supervisory review of banks' own internal assessments of their capital
ratios, and increased public disclosures of risk portfolios. ""The new
proposal, in effect, increases the emphasis on the supervisors' oversight of
the institution's economic capital needs, as it refines the calculation of
the regulatory minimum,"" he said.


Backs Controversial 'Pillar 2.'

One of the innovative features of the proposal is that it would give banks
the option of developing their own internal models for calculating capital
adequacy, Meyer said. However, such methods are expected to rely heavily on
proper supervision. During a recent meeting of the Shadow Financial
Regulatory Committee, this ""pillar"" of the Basel Committee proposal was
called into question as a factor that could be compromised by pressures on
individual national supervisory authorities.

Meyer said, "" ... for some--and perhaps for many--supervisors abroad,
implementing pillar 2 will be an even greater challenge and a more
significant event, potentially introducing a material change in their role.
For all of us, though, it is the right approach--relying more than before on
the internal measures and management practices of banks, giving them more
incentives to invest in better information systems and controls ... ""

In regard to disclosure issues, Meyer acknowledged the formative nature of
the proposal. He said, "" ... we recognized that we still have more work to
do in fashioning a more disciplined and prioritized set of disclosure
requirements, one that balances the cost of compliance against the benefits
of disclosure. This ... is an area in which bank comments [on the Basel
Committee's proposal] would be particularly helpful.""

Jochen Sanio, president of the Federal Banking Supervisory Office of
Germany, called the proposed revision of the Basel Accord a ""radical
departure"" from a conventional approach to international banking regulation
that relies almost entirely on standards that are set by regulators. He
predicted the new Basel Accord will take effect early in 2004.

""Basel II is not the end of the story. Basel II is a first step, a very big
step forward ... but the revolution, to quote ... Trotsky, the revolution
will be a permanent one ... . And after Basel II there will be Basel III and
IV. And that's when we will talk about credit risk models ... I am convinced
it will take the academics only some years to really perfect credit risk
modeling, and then it will be accepted.""

687,"Elizabeth and Bill - As you are aware the NSTAR transaction has been split 
into a one year deal with a potential long term (3 year) deal to follow as 
NSTAR felt the structure of the long term deal was complex and would require 
certain regulatory approvals (which had long lead time and were potentially 
difficult to obtain).  The one year deal will not require such approvals and 
will be structured like the current 6-month deal with which NSTAR is 
comfortable.

This structure eliminates certain issues including the physical/financial 
netting issue.  This is because the financial swap and put is eliminated and 
in its place is simply a fixed energy offset amount which reduces the volumes 
Enron is required to deliver.

The short term structure was set up whereby EPMI would be obligated to supply 
each of the NSTAR operating subs (Boston Edison, Cambridge, and Commonwealth) 
under one agreement.  There are embedded cross defaults in the agreement 
(e.g. a ratings drop by any NSTAR sub results in a MAC).  However, the 
agreement also included a provision that each of the NSTAR subs is severally 
but not jointly liable.  Thus, in a NSTAR default termination scenario EPMI 
would likely need to stream volumes and calculate 3 separate termination 
payments and subsequently pursue each sub separately notwithstanding the 
obligation to pay the termination payment is set up as a collective 
obligation of the NSTAR subs.

Unlike the 6-month deal, the attached draft provides that NSTAR is obligated 
to deliver a parent guarantee.  This was resisted by NSTAR on the short term 
deal as each of the NSTAR subs has an above investment grade (I believe A-) 
credit rating.  I will leave it to Bill to determine whether a parent 
guarantee is required or appropriate; however, provision of the guarantee 
would provide somewhat of a fix to the several liability structure.

I have been advised that NSTAR has a board meeting on Monday and would like 
to see the draft tomorrow.  In this regard it would be greatly appreciate if 
you could provide comments on the document by tomorrow morning.

McKay for later this week.

Yes, Blakes did drop us. 

It is not so much that they dropped us, but how they dropped us.  By way of 
background, Blakes had been working on the matter for approx. 6 weeks and 
knew or ought to have known that Westcoast was involved.  Last week after we 
commenced the law suit, Westcoast went ballistic, and last Monday Dan 
Fournier called to tell me  that Blakes had a legal conflict with Westcoast 
(which he knew was BS).  I told him it was not a legal conflict, but a 
business conflict and that it was too late to raise the issue in the middle 
of an injunction application, but, although we were not happy about it, as a 
favour to Blakes we would consider moving the file after the injunction 
application, when it made sense and in a manner that did not adversely affect 
us.  He seemed OK with that, but later that day, I again spoke to Fournier 
who admitted that it was not a legal conflict but a business conflict, that 
they were in an awkward position with Westcoast, and that he had a conference 
call with the Chairman and the Managing Partner of his firm in Toronto 
Tuesday morning, as well as the partner responsible for Westcoast.  He also 
warned me that Dalton McGrath would be wearing it internally within Blakes if 
there was a problem with Westcoast (I assume hoping to guilt me into moving 
the file).  I told him that was unfortunate but that I could not agree to 
anything that put Enron in a difficult position or adversely affected our 
interests. I spoke to Milly that night, who agreed, and on Tuesday morning 
phoned Fournier and told him again that although we were not pleased, we 
would move the file to another firm as soon as possible after we got through 
the injunction hearing.  Fournier called me back later that day after his 
call with his Toronto partners and told me that, notwithstanding our repeated 
offers to move the file in an orderly fashion after the injunction 
application, that Blakes had made a decision that the file had to be moved 
immediately, such that they could not represent us on the injunction 
application or continue to appear as solicitors of record.  They said the 
factors looked at in deciding between us and Westcoast were the length of the 
relationships, annual billings, complexity of work, strategic importance of 
the work, and their policy of not acting against established clients.  It is 
notable that the injunction is sought only against Enerdata and NGX, and not 
Westcoast, which I pointed out to Fournier, and that I had previously given a 
reasonable solution to Blakes to solve a problem of their own making.  
Fournier also admitted that we are a strategic client, with more complex work 
and higher annual billings.  In other words, I think it was all crap, and we 
lost out to a senior Blakes Toronto partner who did not pay attention when to 
the matter when Blakes first took it on and who, after the fact, is looking 
after an upset Toronto client in a way that put us in an awkward position and 
makes us look weak to Westcoast.

I should point out that Robert Anderson and Dalton McGrath have handled the 
situation excellently, and have been working hard to transition the file 
while I try to find replacement counsel, and opposed the decision of their 
Toronto office at their own personal expense.  I think Fournier wanted to do 
likewise, but he ultimately is more political and accommodated the politics 
of his firm, which is disappointing.

I am writing in regards to ISDA's Energy and Developing Products conference
in Houston on March 6, 2001.  I have attached a copy of the agenda for your
information.
 <<Houston speaker agenda.2001.doc>>

We are now in the process of trying to find suitable speakers for the
conference.  I know Mary Cunningham had mentioned to you about inviting a
senior person from Enron to open the conference on the Overview of Energy
and Developing Markets from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM.  We are concerned that if
Jeffrey Skilling spoke at the conference his participation would take away
our draw at the AGM in April.  We would be delighted to have you open the
conference unless you think we should invite a business speaker to give an
Overview of Energy and Developing Markets.

Should you have any questions, please call me at 212-332-2559.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

744,"Legal friends - 

Patrick and I met with Jason Williams and Veronica Espinoza today to talk, in part, about the flow of information from credit to legal to confirms regarding Credit Attachments.  One area that I wanted to clarify with you folks is regarding the ""title"" of the Annexes.  Sometimes we receive an Annex B/B-1 where, underneath the CP name, there is reference to a specific deal number.   We attach it to the confirm, send it on its way, and we assume then that this Annex is deal specific.

This causes confusion in our groups, because when subsequent deals are transacted with the same counterparty, credit advises us to use the previously provided Annex.  However, when we go to attach what we believe to be the relevant Annex, we stop because it references another deal number.  Jay and Veronica informed us that the Annexes should not be deal specific, just counterparty specific. 

So.....unless there is some other reason of which we are not aware, would you guys be able to discontinue putting specific deal numbers on the Credit attachments you create?  

Let me know if I'm missing part of a bigger picture or if you have questions.

780,"With reference to our meeting that we had on Monday morning (4/2) regarding competing suppliers for capacity on the Crawford Lateral (Duke and EPFS), Planning has determined that the capacity of the Crawford lateral is 86 MMcfd with current facility configurations.  The pipeline capacity is based upon several conditions: 1) WT-1 max suction is 640 psig to allow receipts from Maljamar, Zia, and Attoka on low pressure line to MLV 109, 2) Maximum operating discharge pressure at Crawford CS discharge is 720 psig, 3) All receipts enter pipeline at end of lateral either through Crawford CS or into discharge, and 4) 720 psig max operating discharge pressure is based upon Crawford CS being online.  The maximum capacity through Crawford compressor station as limited by current staging, differential pressure, and horsepower at 720 psig discharge pressure is 60 MMcfd (typical suction pressure is about 450 psig.)

Having stated the above and regarding your request for a new EPFS interconnect, EPFS crosses the Crawford lateral near the end of the lateral.  Therefore, based on current firm obligations with Duke through Crawford CS at 20 MMcfd and actual volumes of 54 MMcfd, TW could physically take EPFS volumes of 32 MMcfd.  EPFS would need to have approximately 740 to 750 psig to get into TW line pressures anticipated near 720 psig.  Or if EPFS chooses to firm up all 50 MMcfd then Duke will be limited to 36 MMcfd physical capacity through Crawford CS.  It is a battle of firm, so however you slice it (volumes) is purely a commercial issue.  

As promised, the Level ""A"" cost estimate for connecting EPFS to the Crawford Lateral is $400,000.  Tax gross ups are not included.  This proposal includes the major items listed below.  The proposed facilities should be designed so that TW Gas Control has telemetry and full remote control of volumes or pressures.

El Paso subsidiary Colorado Interstate Gas is dusting off its Ruby Pipeline project in light of the scramble to increase deliveries to the California market. The project, which originally was announced in 1998 to serve northern Nevada, will be extended to Reno, NV, and into California, the pipeline said in an open season announcement. 
""In response to increased demand for gas supply in northern Nevada and northern California markets, Colorado Interstate Gas Co. (CIG) is announcing an open season to evaluate constructing interstate gas transmission capacity from the Rockies to these markets,"" the announcement states. ""Natural gas production from the Rocky Mountain supply basins is projected to increase dramatically over the next few years and the Ruby Pipeline Project (Ruby) will provide access to these supplies."" 
CIG said it has been working with shippers interested in developing an 850-mile 30- and 36-inch diameter pipeline running from western Wyoming through Elko, NV, Reno, Yuba City, CA, and ending in Sacramento, CA. CIG also anticipates interconnecting in Northern California with Wild Goose Storage, which is currently holding its own open season to evaluate expanding its facility. Ruby will be capable of providing up to 750 MDth per day of incremental transportation capacity to these areas. It is anticipated to be in service in late 2003. 
Parties interested in obtaining transportation service to delivery points in northern Nevada and Northern California are invited to submit bids in this open season, which started on April 23 and will close on May 31. Questions concerning the open season should be directed to Craig Coombs at (719) 520-4387; Ed Miller (719) 520-4305; or Tom Dobson (719) 520-4606.

After yesterday's Marketing Roundtable meeting, I have given further thought to the idea of interconnect services for customers that would bring lower costs by avoiding the contribution in aid of construction and possibly other markup fees that the pipelines are required to charge.

Attached is a strawman of how this might work.  

 

Please take a look at the document and ""tear it apart.""    The more vigorous your analysis the quicker we will know if this is a concept worth pursueing further.

THIS IS A TRUE STORY

A little background: Neiman-Marcus, if you
 don't know already is a very
expensive store i.e. they sell your typical
 $8.00 t-shirt for $50.00.Lets let them have it!!!
My daughter and I had just finished a salad
at a Neiman-Marcus Cafe
 in Dallas and decided to have a small dessert. Because
 both of us are such
 cookie lovers, we decided to try the ""Neiman-Marcus
Cookie."" It was so excellent
 that I asked if they would give me the recipe
 and the waitress said with a
small frown, ""I'm afraid not but, you can buy
 the recipe.""

 Well, I asked how much, and she responded,
""Only two fifty, it's a great deal!"" I agreed with approval, just add it to
 my tab I told her. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement and it was
 $285.00. I looked again and
 I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00
 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the
 statement, it said, Cookie Recipe -$250.00"" That was outrageous!

I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it
 was ""two-fifty,"" which clearly does not mean ""twohundred and fifty dollars""
by any *POSSIBLE* interpretation of the phrase.= Neiman-Marcus
 refused to budge.They would not refund my money, because
 according to them, ""What the
 waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the
 recipe. We absolutely will not refund you money at this point.""

 I explained to her the criminal statues which
 govern fraud in Texas. I threatened to refer them to The Better
 Business Bureau and the State Attorney General Office for engaging in fraud.
I was basically told,""Do what you want, it doesn't matter, we're not refunding
 your money."" I waited, thinking of how I could get even, or even try and get 
any
 of my money back.
 I just said, ""Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going to have
 $250.00 worth of fun.""
 I told her that I was going to see to it that every Cookie lover in
the United States with an e-mail account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from
 Neiman-Marcus...for free. She replied, ""I wish you wouldn't do this."" I
said, ""Well, you should have thought of that before you ripped me off,"" and
 slammed down the phone on her.

So here it is!!! Please, please, please pass it on to everyone youcan
 possibly think of. I paid $250 for this...I don't want Neiman-Marcus
to *ever* get another penny off of this recipe....

 NEIMAN MARCUS COOKIES (Recipe may be halved)

847,"As far as your email questions, my responses are following:

1.  The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial 
counterparties.  There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow.
2.  Duke Energy Corporation.  At Mark's direction, I am sending his note 
below regarding utilities.  Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility 
counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal 
regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters 
in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.  We are in the process of 
negotiating another 30.  Until those masters are executed and we have the 
relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot 
approve them for online trading.  I have made every effort to search company 
websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility 
or not.  If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due 
diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or 
federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only 
make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me.
3.  Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a 
regulated utility.  I am unable to determine from Credit or their website 
what type of regulation they might be subject to.  The note is true that 
Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway.
4.  Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel, 
unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to 
enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws 
specifically provide for these types of transactions.  We will not know this 
until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say ""no"" for 
Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with.
5.  PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an 
eligible swap participant (or ""ESP"").  CFTC regulation limits the derivatives 
trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain 
financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies, 
banks, etc).  Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth 
and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.  Whenever I say 
""not ESP"" or ""not eligible swap participant"" it means they have not met the 
financial net worth test.
6.  The American Coal Company.  See prior note.


",Mark,,Credit The American Coal Company
848,"Per my conversations with Credit, the referenced counterparty is the New

collateral obligations, particularly where the Index moves down relative to 
the forward price and its effect on Swap 1.

@ $5.00 (assuming $5.00 example forward price) there is no issue.  There is 
no collateral obligation and Swap #1 settles at $300MM and Swap #3 settles at 
$0.

@ $6.00 (assuming $5.00 example forward price) there is $15MM collateral 
obligation of ECC to Swapco on Swap #1 and $15MM collateral obligation of RBC 
to ECC on Swap #3 each with $45MM collateral threshold, as Swap #1 settles at 
$360MM due from ECC to Swapco and Swap #3 settles at $60MM due from RBC to

907,"""A creative economy is the fuel of magnificence.""
- Ralph Waldo Emerson

Will technological developments widen or narrow the economic disparities 
present in our world today?

The knee-jerk reaction might be to assume that these developments will widen 
the current economic disparities.  The latest technology is also the most 
expensive, and so it follows that only those who are economically secure will 
have access to it.  Those who are struggling financially will be left behind 
even further than they already were.  

What we need is a creative economy to fuel our magnificence as a society.  
Enron Investment Partners seeks to deliver on this by giving small, 
minority-owned businesses a much-needed push in the direction of financial

Attached is a conservative (and fairly rough) estimate of the size of the 
petrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged 
drought in southern Texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and 
possible curtailed production.   The total annual revenue generated by these 
assets is no less than $20B and could be substantially higher as the 
estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other 
facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable.

Note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial 
complexes from Houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to 
experience such a drought-induced interruption.  The only facilties 
identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers: Brazos, Colorado, 
Navidad, Guadalupe, and Nueces.

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments as we work to determine 
whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable.

Just when you get used to something it changes!

As you may have heard, Enron is implementing a new time entry system as par=

958,"Vlady, here are my comments:

1. NG Correlations : 
- leave existing methodology while using more recent data (1 month instead of 
3 months). This should go anong with running the calibration code more 
frequently 
(at least once a week);
- put the version with weighting for correlation into production. 
2. Implement term structure of correlations for selected groups of 
commodities through joint factor loadings estimation for each of these groups 
I experimented with a group of Brent and 61NY, Christian is working with WTI, 
Brent, C3GC. The experiments should identify suitable groups. 
IT needs to provide a column in some rms table to identify the groups and 
slightly modify vatrfacs code. This will address power correlations as well.
3. FFvols: Smoothing methodology for implied vol curves corresponding to each 
of 12 months
 - develop solutions for improving the existing methodology (Research)
 - implement the proposed solutions (Research, IT)
 - test the results (Research, RAC)
4. Jump Diffusion - NG: finding the evidence of jumps, not obvious.
5 & 6. - I agree.
7 IR & FX Var in RiskTrack - should be probably #1 in this list. 
 - the VAR code is ready, 
 - some results for IR VAR are validated already. (IT, Research, Risk 
Control) 
 - some minor modifications to calibration code vatrfacs are required 
(related to FX data) (IT);
 - data completeness and consistency is still a problem, specifically: 
Futures rates (Infinity, IT);
 - FX books are not set up properly (Risk Control, IT)

961,"Niamh, 
I examined how VAR of ""Financial Products"" portfolio depends on 
term-structure of correlations between BRENT and 61NY. Here are the results 
(for positions on 11/6/00):

1). If we assume correlations of 1 across all forward contacts for Brent and 
61NY
as well as between Brent and 61NY for all maturities,

VAR=$424,199

2). If we calculate correlations based on first 18 contracts prices for both 
Brent and 61NY
together and assume longer maturity contracts are all perfectly correlated, 
then

VAR=$1,868,949

3). Same as (2) but correlations are based on 12 first contracts, everything 
beyond that is perfectly correlated, then:

VAR=$1,106,773.

Conclusion 1:  when we use higher correlations, VAR goes down (as we 
expected).
Conclusion 2: correlations depend on how many forward contracts we use to 
calculate them. We should use all liquidly traded contracts, because prices 
for those contain statistically reliable information.

I chose 18 initially, what is your suggestion?

I do need to remind you of a few things before we converge on San Antonio.
First, be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations.
At last count there were only 6 rooms left.  Second, I need a completed
application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count.
I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate
boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a
form.

Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Friday
so plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if you
can.  Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and
interesting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across the
plaza from the hotel).

We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on
Friday and Saturday evenings.  The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m.
so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the
Alamo at 8:00 p.m.  For Saturday we are still working out plans for the
evening so stay tuned.

There will be more information later as the conference nears.  Looking
forward to seeing you all and in beautiful, sunny San Antonio.

***********************************************************************

CERA's May 2001 World Oil Watch warned of how uncertainties for the oil market
would converge in June. As expected, Iraq is halting its oil exports just as
OPEC assembles for its June 5-6 meeting in Vienna to discuss whether or not to
adjust its current quota for the third quarter.

*  OPEC is likely to roll over the current quota but commit to adjust its
output if the Iraq cutoff is sustained.

*  Iraq's export cutoff sends a warning of its hostility to the concept
of ""smart sanctions.""

*  The fundamentals for the third quarter are tighter than in the second,
regardless of Iraq's decisions.

Today's focus: Think thin

By Phil Hochmuth

Enterprise users looking to deploy thin client technology with
Linux should be aware of a new product released last week
called WinConnect from Thin Computing.

The software allows a Linux-based PC or terminal to connect to
a Microsoft Windows server. WinConnect software would be
installed on a Linux-based PC with a minimum of 16M bytes of
RAM, a 486 processor or higher, a network connection, X-Windows
and at 400K bytes of storage for the WinConnect software. The
software allows the Linux terminal to access applications and
files on servers running Windows NT 4 Terminal Server or a
Windows 2000 Server.

Like any terminal/server setup, all applications and files
accessed by end users reside on the server. According to Thin
Computing, the software could be used to recycle older PC
hardware as Linux terminals, and allow access to applications
such as Microsoft Office on a central server. The company also
bills the product as a cheaper alternative to deploying Windows
CE or Citrix for larger enterprise terminal server projects. A
version of the software is also available to allow Linux-based
PDAs to access Windows server data.

The idea is kind of the reverse of the open source program
Samba used to allow Windows-based clients to access files and
programs on Linux servers. However, unlike Samba, the software
is neither free, nor open source.

The last word I got was that Grant Masson was still coordinating the contract 
and would be the person to talk to about getting a copy of the license.  I 
checked to see if I had an electronic copy somewhere, but couldn't find 
anything.  I suspect my copy was paper, and it would have been returned to 
Grant when I went back to Portland General Electric.  Probably didn't speak 
to the situation in London, anyway, because the real interest in London 
didn't arise until after I would have gotten my copy.

Grant is transitioning to his new job with El Paso in London, so if you have 
difficulty reaching him, check with Vince Kaminski, or if Vince is 
unavailable, Shriley Crenshaw.  Shirley may know the person in Enron Legal or 
Contracts Admin. who worked with Grant on the Henwood license.

Of course, Eric T. would have a copy.  If you run into problems with Houston, 
have Eric send you a fax.  (The license is relatively short as contracts go.)

Vince and I spent some time thinking about the diligence process for the 
trading analytics.   There is a limited amount that can be accomplished in a 
two day time period.   I think a reasonable start would be the following:

1.  Obtain an audited history of the trading strategies which have been 
implemented in order to verify profitability, and P/L volatility of each.
2.  Review needed working capital and risk capital requirements and compare 
these to projections for trading income.
3.  Review current level of access to electronic markets and verify that a 
change of ownership would not have adverse consequences, i.e. are there 
guarantees of continued access using the current systems?
4.  Review feasibility of entry into proposed new markets?   It is far from 
clear that there will be any synergy with most commodity markets given the 
current limited ""electronic"" liquidity.
5.  Review, at least qualitatively, the current trading strategies being 
used.   Try to develop some estimate of how fast the profitability of these 
strategies will disappear as other's implement similar trading models.   What 
is the trade off between trade quantity and slippage.
6.  Review the methodology used to generate new trading strategies which will 
be needed to replace the current models as they become unprofitable and 
outdated.
7.  Try to determine if there will be any value in transfer of trading 
technology to Enron's other markets, given the illiquidity of these markets 
as compared to the financial equity markets.

If there were a sufficiently long time horizon for our analysis, we would 
probably want to run their system on a test set of data.

http://www.unifr.ch/econophysics/comments/nov_99/paper_of_the_month_dec.html

Whether the specific papers are of interest to what exactly we're doing or 
not, I cannot say.  On the other hand, given UH's drive to create an 
""Econophysics"" specialization within the physics department, I thought we 
could both help them *and* drive it towards a direction that it could be of 
use to us.  I think that they would very much like to hear what the Industry 
would like to see from such a specialization.  Some of the things that have 
been discussed as course offerings would be:
Basic physics courses (mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, stat. physics,math 
methods) 
various finance courses like options, banking, etc.
Statistics, Math Methods, and Statistical Physics (that could teach topics 
like BRownian motion, lognormal distributions, fractals,  Levy flights, and 
statistics of 'large deviations', which are of interest
Comp Science (Java, C++, data structures, algorithms)
Monte Carlo simulations
etc
Setting up some sort of exchange, where at minimum we could get summer 
interns from this program, would also be beneficial to both sides.  Even 
better, a wider collaboration between Enron and the Physics department could 
be set up.

Yes, it might be more productive to talk on the phone.  Given our time

The situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the
capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour, but
in constructing the stack, increments of a plant may be scattered throughout
the stack, based on their respective incremental heat rates.  (This is why
increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model.)  Results for
the capacity increments, however, are not available as output; only each
plant's aggregate values are reported.

I had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a
Homer City, NY plant we were studying a few years ago.  Attached is the SQL
query you can import into MS ACCESS to do the same thing for you (making
appropriate modifications to the year, hour, etc.)  Unfortunately, no Henwood
documentation on the output variables existed when I created this query, so I
can not really tell you what they represent anymore.  An acquaintance of mine
at Entergy and I were lobbying to get Henwood to provide some documentation,
so it may be available now.

I am in the middle of preparing some presentations right now, so it might be 
more productive to speak by phone (503-464-8430).  Please leave your number, 
if you get my voicemail.

To get you started, you might see if you can get access to the FERC GADS 
database of plant forced and planned availability.  It seems others in 
Research have asked about this, so you may already have this at your 
disposal.  The EIA has a good electronic database of plant FOR and POR 
available for free (http://www.nerc.com/~esd/).  I know Alexios in RE/EES has 
this.  If you wanted to do it the hard way, you can also ask Jaison to access 
the EPA's CEMS data he has summarized on a machine there in Research.  It 
contains hourly plant operation for every unit over about 50MW, which you 
could aggregate up.

The WSCC 10-year forecast of new plant construction and loads is a good place 
to start for plant construction information, but suffers from some notorious 
""self-reporting"" error.  It is available in pdf form from the web site 
http://www.wscc.com/.  Other sources that should be more near-term, but more 
accurate are the CEC inventory of plants (http://www.energy.ca.gov/) and the 
BPA Whitebook (http://www.transmission.bpa.gov).

As far as basic economic data is concerned, you can either rely on the

I took the curve shift P&L from the RMS database and prompt month volatility for both GAS and POWER for the period of Aug-2000 to Aug-2001.
In case POWER, volatility has relationship with VAR but less likely with P&L.  For GAS volatility, the correlation with VAR is weaker than the case of POWER and also low relationship with P&L.

   
Thanks.

We want to personally thank you for agreeing to join the Energy Committee of
the C.T. Bauer College of Business Dean's Advisory Board (Current Committee
Members Attached).  The Committee is a terrific group of people with a
diverse background that will represent exceedingly well the needs of the
Houston energy community.  As a member of the Energy Committee, you also
become a member of the Dean's Advisory Board, which is having its next
meeting on January 17, 2002.  This Dean's Advisory Board Meeting will
include the grand opening ceremonies for the new AIM Center for Investment
Management in the Bauer College.  Please mark your calendar for January 17,
2002 for this important event.

We are delighted and excited about the Energy Market Center of Excellence
and look forward to your leadership in guiding and shaping its rapid
evolution (Draft Business Plan attached).  Our first meeting of the Energy
Committee on November 14, 2001 will be held at the Bauer College of
Business - Melcher Hall in the AIM Center Board Room, which is on the first
floor as you enter the building, from 5:00 PM to 7:00PM (Agenda Attached).
The parking gate will be open for your convenience. We believe the role you
will be playing (Energy Committee Charter attached) in integrating the
Energy business community with the University of Houston and Bauer College
could well be the model for the next generation metropolitan research
university.  We look forward to seeing you on November 14th and thanks again
for your commitment of time and support.

Thanks for asking!

I'd like to leave San Francisco
non-stop to Houston on United
1556 at 11:10 am Jan 9, arriving 4:44pm,
then go to Austin on the late
afternoon of the 10th (for a seminar at UT),
then I need to get from Austin to San Francisco
on the evening of the 11th.
(There is a United flight 419 connecting through Denver
that leaves Austin at 5:30 pm,
connecting to United 409 out of Denver).
If there is a non-stop from Austin to
San Francisco or San Jose, that is even
better. (United, my preferred, does
not have a non-stop from Austin to
the Bay Area.)

The cost will be shared 50-50 with U. Texas,
if that's OK with you and them. I have copied
the organizer of the seminar there,
Professor Ron Kaniel.

I am forwarding you a message I received a few days ago. I want to ask you 
for advice how to handle this case.

My first  reaction was to ignore it. The longer I think about it, the more 
convinced I become that some action 
is required.

Let's try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a 
female employee
was harassed by a male colleague. An employee informs her boss a few months 
later about
the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it. In many similar 
cases, courts  subsequently 
found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such 
complaints.

The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is 
immaterial. 
If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double 
standard in
handling sexual harassment cases.

My recommendation would be to ask Maureen to attend sensitivity training and 
sexual harassment prevention class.

Please, let me know what you think. Sorry to burden you with this case.

Gray Davis has announced that he will soon announce two energy czars to lead 
the state through the current crisis. ?Logical candidates include: Laurel and 
Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Beavis and Butthead, and Siegfried and Roy.

The environmentalist Green Party is well-named. ?Thanks to its role in 
blocking construction of new power plants, Californians are forking over 
plenty of green for energy.

California?s power industry is very Kennedyesque. ?Their message to consumers 
is, ""Ask not what your energy company can do for you; ask what you can do for 
your energy company.""

Congress might get involved in California?s energy crisis. ?There?s nothing a 
drowning victim needs more than having an anchor thrown to him.

It?s one thing for California politicians trying to solve the energy problem 
to go back to the drawing board, but do they have to ask taxpayers to buy 
them a new one?

In California, lawmakers are now getting down to details. ?The latest debate 
involves what to name the bonds the state will issue to help bail out the 
utilities. ?Proposals on the table include: ?Blackout Bonds;Bailout Bonds; 
Davis Debts; Blunder Bonds; Fiasco Funds.

the state through the current crisis. ?Logical candidates include: Laurel and 
Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Beavis and Butthead, and Siegfried and Roy.

The environmentalist Green Party is well-named. ?Thanks to its role in 
blocking construction of new power plants, Californians are forking over 
plenty of green for energy.

California?s power industry is very Kennedyesque. ?Their message to consumers 
is, ""Ask not what your energy company can do for you; ask what you can do for 
your energy company.""

Congress might get involved in California?s energy crisis. ?There?s nothing a 
drowning victim needs more than having an anchor thrown to him.

It?s one thing for California politicians trying to solve the energy problem 
to go back to the drawing board, but do they have to ask taxpayers to buy 
them a new one?

In California, lawmakers are now getting down to details. ?The latest debate 
involves what to name the bonds the state will issue to help bail out the 
utilities. ?Proposals on the table include: ?Blackout Bonds;Bailout Bonds; 
Davis Debts; Blunder Bonds; Fiasco Funds.

1136,"At the close of our very productive meeting yesterday, I promised to
circulate a brief update on California's electricity demand trends; it
appears below as an attachment at the close of a note I circulated
within NRDC earlier today, which I thought would be of interest:

Today should have been a severe test for the California grid:  we had
the third straight day of high temperatures throughout much of the state
and the Southwest (weather forecasts earlier in the week had prompted
warnings of rolling blackouts).  As I write this at 4 pm on Thursday,
average temperatures throughout the entire PG&E system are above 90
degrees.  But peak loads for the day will not reach 40,000 Megawatts,
and reserve margins are comfortable (about 15% at the peak hour).
California's last rolling blackouts occurred six weeks ago (and those
were very modest in scale).  It is far too soon to declare victory, but
these are hopeful signs, and they will help relieve pressure on the
Governor to crank up dirty emergency generators.  NRDC's updated
assessment of recent CA electricity consumption trends (attached again
just in case you've lost it) indicates that demand reductions clearly
are a big part of the reason why things are looking up.  There are
plenty of reasons for continued caution:  the entire West can get much
hotter, hydropower conditions in the Northwest remain awful,  and
complacency could shift demand back up quickly (much of the recent load
reductions represent reversible voluntary actions).

Senate asked to hold Reliant in contempt over document release
By DON THOMPSON
Associated Press Writer

07/18/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A Senate committee investigating possible price gouging in 
California's energy market voted unanimously Wednesday to ask the full Senate 
to find Houston-based Reliant Energy in contempt for failing to comply with a 
subpoena for documents. 
The decision came despite Reliant's last-ditch offer to turn over 10,000 
documents under a contingent confidentiality agreement that the Senate Select 
Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation rejected.
""I'm not just trying to buy time,"" said Reliant attorney Charles J. Stevens. 
""We believe we have acted cooperatively. We believe we have a good-faith 
legal dispute."" 
""It's clear you're trying to work with us. It's not contempt with contempt,"" 
agreed committee Chair Joseph Dunn, D-Santa Ana. 
By contrast, Sen. Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista, blasted Reliant's ""shoddy 
behavior"" before backing what he termed ""a legally unprecedented step."" 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant, it will be the first 
time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a 
committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging allegations 
involving cement sales to the state. 
There are no set penalties, said committee special counsel Laurence Drivon. 
By law, ""the Senate can take such action as it deems necessary and 
appropriate."" 
The contempt citation will be presented to the Senate Thursday, but will 
immediately be sent to the Rules Committee for another hearing before the 
full Senate acts, Dunn said. 
He said the committee had no choice but to seek the sanctions and likely 
force a court battle after it was unable to reach agreement with Reliant over 
the confidentiality of its documents. The committee voted 6-0 in favor of the 
contempt finding. 
""If we reach agreement on these issues, the process would be terminated 
immediately,"" Dunn said. 
In that light, the committee stepped back from its contempt vote last week 
against Enron Corp. after the company and committee moved closer to agreement 
over its release of thousands of documents stored in Texas. 
Enron sued the committee last week to stop the subpoena of its financial and 
electricity trading records. Among its objections are that only the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has the authority to investigate wholesale 
markets. 
Reliant, like Enron, had argued the company's financial papers are outside 
the committee's jurisdiction because most of its operations and paperwork are 
outside California. 
Atlanta-based Mirant Inc. also at least temporarily avoided a contempt 
citation by agreeing to turn over subpoenaed documents. The committee will 
review both companies' compliance in 30 days.

Calif. Senate Panel Votes To Cite Reliant With Contempt

07/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A California Senate committee Wednesday voted to 
cite Reliant Energy (REI) with contempt because the company has refused to 
provide documents for an investigation into wholesale electricity prices in 
the state, said committee Chairman Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana. 
The committee also voted to forward a contempt charge for Enron Corp (ENE) to 
the full Senate, where it will be voted on. If the charge is approved, the 
Senate will vote on punishment, which could include hefty fines or 
incarceration of executives.
Talks between Enron and committee attorneys Monday seemed to indicate the 
company would agree to committee demands, but since then it has become clear 
the company doesn't plan to comply, Dunn said. 
""If you had asked two days ago I'd have said we are cautiously optimistic 
about Enron. Now I'm pessimistic about it. We felt they were indicating to us 
a willingness to do what the other generators were willing to do, but the 
bottom line is that they are not, despite their cooperative-sounding words. 
We are no closer to them coming into compliance than we were a week ago,"" 
Dunn said. 

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation is requesting 
that Reliant and Enron provide 16 kinds of documents related to market 
behavior, rent a depository for the documents, and sign the committee's 
version of a confidentiality agreement. Both generators have refused to meet 
those demands, Dunn said. 
The committee will drop its contempt charges at any time before a full Senate 
vote if either generator agrees to its requests. 
A report detailing Enron's contempt charge will be sent to the full Senate on 
Thursday for introduction, but is expected to be referred to the Senate Rules 
Committee for review before a floor vote. 
Dunn said he didn't know how long the report would be considered in the Rules 
Committee, but he will ""certainly push them to do it as soon as possible."" 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company ""will continue to negotiate"" 
with the committee. 
Legislators are scheduled to begin a monthlong break Friday, but aren't 
certain that will happen because they still need to pass a budget bill and 
are trying to approve a bill to rescue Edison International (EIX) unit 
Southern California Edison before leaving. 
Dunn said it would take a few days to prepare a report on Reliant's contempt 
charge. 
""We may not be able to forward that report to the Senate floor until the day 
we get back from recess,"" Dunn said. 
No one at Reliant could be immediately reached for comment. 
The committee originally was poised to cite seven other electricity 
generators for contempt, but all eventually agreed to provide the requested 
information.

employees:

Send an e-mail from Ken and Jeff (or maybe just Jeff) about the events in

During the next month or so while this is a hot issue, we could give updates 
in every issue of eBiz (that's every other week).
In April, we could follow up with an in-depth article in Enron Business (Vol. 
2 - April) about the issues in California and the status of all our 
deregulation efforts.  We could interview you, Rick and other key employees 
who have been actively involved.  It's been a year since we've done this.  
Hold a brown bag (hosted by you or Rick).  We could videotape the event and 
put it on IP-TV as well as offer copies of the video to employees who can't 
access IP-TV. 
ETV:  When an Enron executive testifies before the U.S. Senate or other 
government body, we could run it live, replay it after the event.  We already 
did this with your testimony a couple of weeks ago that was replayed on 
CSPAN-2.

What about India?  There is an article in eBiz (dated Feb. 16) but I'm sure 
there are lots of questions about the future of this project.  I plan to

Practices Filed Against SoCal Gas, San Diego Gas & Electric, And El Paso 
Natural Gas

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Two related class action lawsuits
have been filed in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles, against
Southern California Gas Company, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company, Sempra
Energy (parent of the two utilities), El Paso Natural Gas Co., and other
companies related to El Paso Natural Gas.

The two lawsuits allege a conspiracy resulting in restraint of trade and
unfair competition and unlawful business practices.  The complaints summarize
the issue as follows:

This action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the
newly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering
California's electrical system and threatening California's economy.  It
is perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history.
Southern California's current ""energy crisis"" is not simply the result of
ever-increasing demand by a growing population for energy.  Rather, it is
the direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industry's most
powerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market
dominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to
regulation.  When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was
disassembled, those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to
ensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power.  Their
unlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent
astronomical increases in the price of natural gas and electricity.  As a
result, Southern California customers have had to pay billions of dollars
extra for their natural gas and electric needs.  This lawsuit seeks to
recover those damages. (Para. 1 and 2 of complaint.)


""In September of 1996, top executives of Southern California Gas Company
(""SoCal Gas""), San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (""SDG&amp;E"") and El Paso Natural 
Gas
Corporation (""EPNG"") met at the Embassy Suites Hotel, near Sky Harbor
Airport in Phoenix, Arizona.  Fearing a new era of open competition and
lower prices, these latter day captains of industry gathered secretly to
hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas
and electricity markets.  At the meeting, these three companies, who
together dominate the Southern California natural gas market, illegally
agreed not to compete against each other in the Southern California and
Baja California natural gas delivery markets.  They also conspired to
prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against
them and lowered natural gas prices in these markets.  The conspirators
sought to eliminate competition, take advantage of electric deregulation,
drive up the price of natural gas, and profit from the increased prices.""
(Para 4 of complaint.)


One of the two lawsuits addresses the effects of the conspiracy on natural
gas prices; the other deals with the effects on electricity prices.
(The price of gas-fired generation establishes the price for most of the
electricity used in Southern California.)

Copies of the two lawsuits filed this morning are available as Adobe
Acrobat (PDF) files on the web site of the law firm of O'Donnell and Shaeffer
at http://oslaw.com/osnews.

Attorneys representing the plaintiffs are available for interviews, and
can also provide additional materials, including copies of the agenda prepared
for the secret meeting, as well as graphics illustrating the location of
natural gas pipelines that were planned, but then terminated by the defendants
following the secret meeting in Phoenix.

E SOURCE Study:  Customer-Side Electricity Demand Reduction Could Stem Rising 
Power Prices

BOULDER, Colo., Dec. 18 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
With electricity prices rising
like floodwaters in California and other states, limited generation capacity
has garnered the most attention as the culprit.  Many see constructing new
power plants as the sole solution for bringing prices down.  However, E SOURCE
research just out of the field indicates that convincing customers to reduce
their electricity demand in exchange for cash could provide tremendous price
relief in open power markets.  ""Our study shows that commercial and industrial
customers are very willing to reduce demand if the price is right, if
mechanisms are in place for communicating those prices, and if they have a
means of controlling their electric loads.  We found that larger customers
could offer almost 20 percent of their load as negawatts -- temporary
reductions in electricity demand,"" says E SOURCE Vice President Bill LeBlanc.

Because most electricity use is considered essential and rising wholesale
prices don't immediately affect end users, prices can go sky high when power
supplies get tight.  But if demand dropped in response to high prices, LeBlanc
contends that overall power costs would be much lower.  He explains, ""Although
there's a disconnect between price and demand in the marketplace today, we've
uncovered a significant subset of customers who seem ready to participate in a
dynamic pricing market.  Unfortunately, most of them don't yet have the
communication and control tools that would make load management possible.
They also haven't been offered a pricing product they like.""  The E SOURCE
research study confirms that customers want flexibility in deciding whether to
participate in load reductions on a daily or even hourly basis, as just one
example.

So how many negawatts are available?  According to the E SOURCE national
market survey, medium-to-large commercial and industrial customers could
potentially reduce their demand by 18 percent if offered a market price of $1
per kWh (one of the tested price points) for reduced electricity usage.  At
this price -- which, incidentally, is what Edison International CEO and
President John Bryson reported that his company paid for electricity on
December 12 in wholesale power markets -- about 55,000 MW could be made
available across the U.S., and about 4,800 MW in California.  LeBlanc adds,
""We can't expect to capture all of this potential.  But with the right
product, pricing scheme, and marketing, it would be possible to help relieve
price pressure on the whole system.""  The E SOURCE study, ""Energy Pricing and
Load Management:  What Do End-Users Want?"" can help energy service providers
design appropriate products and identify the customer groups most likely to
participate in such programs.  It's based on an extensive research with over
700 energy decision-makers across the U.S. and Canada.

1167,"Gov. Davis open to tax on electric generators' profits 

Updated: April 4, 2001 - 5:52 p.m. 

Gov. Gray Davis says he is open to supporting a windfall-profits tax being
proposed by lawmakers on electric generators that have made a fortune
selling power to California this year. 

He also broke with his appointees on the Public Utilities Commission in
saying private companies and other large users should be allowed to contract
directly for power with generators. 

. . . . 

For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their
power from generators instead of going through the utilities. 

A January law that allowed the state to begin buying power for two nearly
bankrupt utilities barred such side contracts. 

""That was done originally with the thought the state would have more power
and no one to sell it to if companies got off the grid,"" Davis said. ""But
our problem is the opposite this summer. If companies want to get off the
grid, we should encourage, not discourage that."" 

The Democratic governor's comments came after he met behind closed doors for
more than two hours with Assembly Republicans, who have sharply criticized
his handling of the energy crisis. 

""I think everyone agreed there are no political winners unless we resolve
this challenge,"" Davis said. ""There were a lot of suggestions in there I'm
willing to adopt."" 

. . . . 

Davis said he hasn't written the remarks he will make during a five-minute
address at 6:05 p.m. Thursday that he has asked California television
stations to carry live. 

However, he said he will ""share with them (viewers) the progress that we've
made and what we have to get through."" 

He is expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases
approved last week by the PUC for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
and Southern California Edition Co.

Aside from what you already know on the Enron de Mexico ENA regulatory and 
commercial front (in documents that I gave you), I am also supporting 
HydroMod and EBS in their efforts to materialize business oportunities in 
Mexico.

Enron de Mexico has also taken an active  role in the Bufete Industrial deal 
with EE&CC although I do not have anything to do with that.  Nevertheless, I 
should say that the One Enron approach is at work in the Mexico City office.



Apparently very soon EBS is going to sublet some space in our MX City office

possibility of getting some regulatory support here from me.  Is this 
convenient for our organization?  How should we go about it?

1176,"By now, most of you have heard about the FirstEnergy Settlement, underwhich 
FE will recover as best we can ascertain at this time, all of its stranded 
costs.  Key components of the setllement include:

1. FE makes 1120 mw of power available at a price that varies by customer 
class and increases gradually over the 5 years.  (The price does not include 
line losses which the Company agreed to throw in if another marketer signs on 
- none did),  The market price is also the shopping credit.  The  shopping 
incentive is then added to the credit . The shopping credit for residential 
and commercial customers is low but could possibly work pending analysis from 
structuring.  The industrial credit is very low.

2. Customers on special contracts (approximately 800 of them), can during the 
first year either opt to cancel their contract or extend it through the RTC 
recovery period, which is unlawful in my view, although that observation did 
not slow anyone down.

3.  The settlement creates an implicit cap on shopping of 20% since the 
Company will seek to have the incentive removed once the 20% is reached.  The 
agreement states that if the incentive is not removed, then customers will 
pay for the incentive as a deferral which will extend the recovery period.  
This too is also unlawful because it allows the recovery of generation 
related costs beyond the market development period.

4.  Barring extension of the shopping incentive and other caveats, the RTC 
rolls off on December 31, 2006 for Ohio Edison, June 30th, 2007 for Toledo 
Edison and December 31, 2008 for Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company.

5.  Distribution rates are frozen until 2007.

6. There is a 5% residential rate cut.

7. FE absorbs the pancaking charges for power coming through PJM and MISO 
until the RTO is up and running.

This settlement is basically political.  Over the past several weeks, FE has 
cut a host of sidebar deals with each of the intervenors and customers who 
signed on to this travesty.  When the parties were assembled for settlement 
talks, they lasted 2 days before parties surrendered their litigation 
positions.  The hearing schedule is equally aggregious.  Coincidentally, the 
hearing examiners had a schedule in mind that was extremely similar to FE.  
Our testimony is due on April 24 with no further discovery prior to its 
filing.  The testimony of FE and defenders of the Stip is due on April 26.  
We then have 3 days for depositions with supplemental or rebuttal testimony 
being a big IF.  The hearing commences May 2.

The parties who thought it was fine to give FE $8.9 billion without 
quantification or review are Consumers Counsel, Staff, Industrial Users, 
Retail Merchants, Low income (some), Ohio Manufacturers, Shell Energy, 
Kroger, AK Steel, Ohio Hospital Association.

Those fighting the stipulation are all the other marketers, the Cleveland 
Growth Association, the City of Cleveland, Citizens Action, Citizens Power,  
Safe Energy Communications Council.

By separate e-mail, Laurie Knight will send you the shopping credit and 
shopping incentive numbers.  Also, if you would like a copy of the 
settlement, please let Laurie know.

Two final points.  We are doing everything we can to try to improve or derail 
acceptance of the settlement, although it appears to be a fait accompli.  
Second, the stage has been set for similar type negotiations with the other 
utilities

amendment passed, which prevents either BLM or the Forest Service from 
enacting new fiber optic federal lands rights-of-way policies.  The BLM made

Senators and staff and they got nowhere.

Action now moves to Conference, which for us means a focus on the House

Democrats.  Interior Approps Subcommittee Chairman Regula remains opposed, at 
least publicly, but we think we can get other Members to swing him.  We trust 
he'll come up with a sensible, face saving compromise on his own, eg, 
formally beginning a review process with his Subcommittee having oversight -- 
at this point, our language literally forbids BLM or Forest Service from even 
meeting to discuss the issue.

We continue, though, on several other fronts:

1. We have the New Dems writing OMB on the issue and several Senators and 
Congressmen writing BLM and USFS
2. We've increased the pressure on the White House, and are letting them know 
through very senior back door channels that in our opinion, BLM/Forest 
Service have not gotten the message.  Our position is that we'll be satisfied 
that they've changed their evil ways when the new assessment on the Mt. Hood

BLM is on the retreat and has asked for a meeting, which we've refused.   We

this point.  So until the Approps process concludes we're continuing with the

Banks hitting bottom

Earnings disappointments and fears about bad loans have triggered a new
round of selloffs for financials like Bank of America and Chase Manhattan.
But it looks as though the worst is over.

By Michael Sivy

Bank of America's announcement on Wednesday afternoon that fourth-quarter
profits would fall substantially short of expectations sent major bank
stocks into a tailspin. B of A [BAC] closed the day down nearly 8 percent,
while Chase [CMB] dropped 3 percent. These declines are only the latest bad
news for the commercial banking sector, which has been battered all year.
In fact, both B of A and Chase are down by more than 20 percent since the
start of the year.

I can't say I anticipated the sell-off, since I bought Bank of America more
than 15 percent above its current price. Nonetheless, there's nothing
surprising about banks reporting bad numbers after a year of high interest
rates and six months of slowing economic growth.

Traders also got caught off guard by B of A's news. They were heavy buyers
of bank stocks Tuesday after Alan Greenspan addressed a conference of
bankers in New York City. The Federal Reserve chairman said ""the pace of
economic activity has moderated appreciably."" He added that the Fed now has
to be more attentive to the risk that the economy might slow too much. Many
economists read into those comments that the Fed will formally change its
stance in favor of lowering interest rates at its Dec. 19 meeting, and
actually cut them early next year.

Such news ought to be bullish for bank stocks. So why are they still
falling? Basically, they've virtually acknowledged that they'll report
sub-par earnings and higher loan losses this quarter and probably next.
Share prices could dip a bit more as those weak results get reported. But
most of that bad news is history -- from here on out, the trends will be
getting better, not worse.

Bank of America, which merged with NationsBank in 1998, is the largest U.S.
bank. Its stock is currently down to a paltry $38, just $2 above the
52-week low. For 2001, B of A should report earnings of about $5 a share,
just a single-digit gain from estimated 2000 results. Over the next five
years, however, analysts think the bank could grow earnings by about 10
percent annually. Including the 5 percent-plus dividend yield, that's quite
a generous return for shares that are trading at only eight times earnings.

Chase Manhattan presents a similar case. The bank, which is acquiring J.P.
Morgan, has been knocked down in anticipation of bad fourth-quarter
results. Chase is a major lender to troubled Xerox, for example, so that
could be a source of loan losses. Nonetheless, the banking giant offers 11
percent projected long-term earnings growth and a 3 percent dividend yield.
With a P/E of just over 10 times next year's estimated earnings, Chase
looks like a compelling buy as well.

Harold Evans's tight, journalistic prose marks the significant events and 
personages in America's rise to superpower status in this sprawling yet

by Sir Winston Churchill and Winston S. Churchill
Everyone knows Winston Churchill as the great statesman who helped sail 
Britain's ship of state through World War II. Less noticeable have been 
Churchill's contributions as a historian and author. Many of his numerous 
histories contain information on the United States--from America's discovery 
to the nation's founding and up to the mid-20th century. Grandson Winston S. 
Churchill has edited this work into one volume, titled ""The Great Republic,"" 
now available in paperback. [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]""Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong"" 
by James W. Loewen
Little seems to delight historian James W. Loewen more than picking apart the 
cherished myths of American history. Few Americans study history after high 
school--instead, Loewen writes, they turn to roadside historical markers, 
guidebooks, museums, and tours of battlefields, childhood homes, and massacre 
sites. After finishing Loewen's alternately angry and bemused expos,, readers 
will likely never trust a roadside historical marker or tour guide 
again--which may prompt them to turn to history books to check things out for 
themselves. [IMAGE]Read more

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
November 29, 2000

Fix your mix

In volatile markets like this one, sectors behave in radically different
ways. Here's what you need to know to find today's best opportunities.

By Michael Sivy

When the economy is purring along, most stock groups rise and fall
together. But amid uncertainty and turmoil, different groups suffer at
different times and rebound with varying delays. That's what's been
happening this year, and investors preparing for 2001 need to examine each
sector independently to find the best bargains and to minimize risk.

Since January, there have been three big divergences in the market. The
first has been between tech stocks and defensive groups. The second has
been between issues with high P/Es and those with low P/Es. And the third
has been between companies with big market capitalizations and those with
small caps.

After many months of leadership, tech stocks peaked in March and have
declined as evidence of an economic slowdown accumulated. Technology
companies began warning that their earnings might fall short in upcoming
quarters, and the entire sector suffered as money managers and individual
investors began reducing their exposure. By Thanksgiving, even the
strongest and most popular tech stocks, including Cisco and Oracle, were
down a third or more from their highs. And even at current levels the
stocks aren't cheap with P/Es as high as 50. They'll be vulnerable to
further declines until it's clear that the economy has completed its 
downswing.

By contrast, consumer stocks (which are defensive because they aren't as
tied to economic cycles as tech stocks are) benefited from investors'
flight to safety. After having dropped by a third to less than $60 a share
in March, Procter & Gamble [PG] rebounded 35 percent to $74. And
Anheuser-Bush [BUD] has rallied more than 70 percent over the same period
to $48. Those stocks are now trading at more than 20 times next year's
earnings, so they're no longer exceptionally cheap. But such defensive
issues may still be worth buying to balance a portfolio that has been
overloaded in tech.

Energy stocks have also benefited immensely as a defensive sector, but they
were helped even more by this year's sharp runup in the price of oil.
ExxonMobil [XOM], one of the most conservative international oil companies,
has gained 20 percent since March to $89 a share. I doubt, however, that
oil can remain above $30 a barrel for more than a year or two -- today's
high prices will bring on more supply and an economic slowdown could reduce
demand. As a result, I think energy stocks may have seen the best parts of
their gains.

While constrained supply has pushed up prices in the oil business,
oversupply has done the opposite in telecommunications. Fiercely
competitive phone companies have overbuilt their networks so much that they
have been undercutting each other on pricing and cutting back on further
equipment purchases. The result is that stocks throughout the sector --
from service providers like AT&T [T] and WorldCom [WCOM] to equipment
manufacturers like Lucent [LU] -- have lost more than half their value
since the spring. Statistically, I think stocks in the group are
undervalued by a third, but they still may represent dead money for the
next six months.

These divergences among industry sectors are the most visible symptom of
the roiling market, but they aren't the only one. The largest U.S.
companies have average P/Es in the mid-20s, and the most popular giants
have P/Es double or nearly triple historical levels. By contrast, small
companies -- those with market caps of less than $3.5 billion -- have
average P/Es of below 18.

 From all these cross-currents, two important ideas emerge. At any point
there's likely to be at least one sector that's deeply undervalued. Don't
try to predict the turns -- just buy one or two of the blue chips in the
sector that looks cheapest. Right now, defensive stocks are still in an
uptrend but they're no longer cheap, while the techs are still falling
(their decline isn't over yet). You can either buy good tech values and
ride out any further decline or wait until they look fully washed out. The
other important idea is that high-P/E blue-chip growth stocks are way
overvalued compared with everything else. Of course, those are the stocks
everyone most wants to own. But be smart -- diversify with a value fund or
a fund that holds mid- and small-caps with an average P/E below 20. They're
out there.

Aluminum shines

The economy should come back later this year, and classic cyclical stocks,
such as Alcoa, have already begun major upswings.

By Michael Sivy

Amid all the concern about technology stocks, many investors seem to have
forgotten that the traditional business cycle still exists. But while the
drop -- and the more recent recovery -- in tech has been the most dramatic
event in the stock market, companies in other sectors have felt the results
of the economic slowdown, too. In fact, many traditional cyclical companies
experienced a classic bear market that ended a few months ago -- and they
now appear to be in the first phase of a recovery that could last as long
as five years.

The biggest gains figure to be in industries that benefit both from
improving economic activity and from moderate increases in inflation. Chief
among these stocks are the producers of raw materials. Since the supply of
commodities can't change very quickly, prices are set largely by the level
of demand. As a result, an economic upturn can make commodities prices firm
up quite suddenly. Moreover, initial inflation pressures -- such as those
that have been reported in the past couple of months -- typically show up
in the prices of metals before they show up in manufactured goods and 
services.

Alcoa [AA] is a prime example of such a stock. The world's largest aluminum
producer, Alcoa's earnings hardly fell during the slowdown of the past nine
months. Growth is expected to revive and accelerate over the rest of 2001.
And next year, the company is projected to increase earnings more than 30
percent.

Alcoa's resilience has several sources. One has been aggressive cost
reduction. Alcoa has already trimmed annual costs by $1 billion and plans
to cut $1 billion more. In addition, the aluminum giant has been shedding
non-core assets, such as an alumina refinery in Australia and the Thiokol
propulsion business that it acquired through an acquisition. Over the next
couple of years, Alcoa should become a more focused and more profitable
company.

Despite all this good news, Alcoa's results have been held back by three
factors -- the general economic slowdown, the somewhat depressed aerospace
market and the West Coast electricity shortage, which has idled some
production capacity. All three, however, are about to improve. The economy
should be in a solid recovery by next year. The construction of commercial
aircraft should reach a peak in the next few years, thanks to new models
from both Airbus and Boeing. And power availability in the Pacific
Northwest will eventually recover as well.

The result will be an extraordinarily strong upswing in earnings that will
rival those of some tech stocks. Over the next five years, Alcoa's earnings
should increase faster than 15 percent annually. At $41.50, Alcoa is
trading at just about 20 times estimated earnings for the current year and
less than 16 times next year's projected results. That compares with an
average P/E of 18 over the past six years. For anyone looking to balance a
tech portfolio without sacrificing above-average growth, Alcoa is a perfect
choice.

1247,"To all:

As of today, Bridgeline has $14MM of cash and expects to get $15MM from the payment of Oct receivables by the end of the month.  They have fully drawn down the $35MM revolver that we put in place earlier this year.  Trevor Mihalik (Bridgeline CFO) is preparing a cashflow forecast for Bridgeline from now to the end of the year and next year.

Bridgeline's major cash needs are to fund working capital (payables and margin calls) and to purchase gas that must be used to dewater the storage cavern (Enron #1) that we contributed to the partnership.  The dewatering process is now underway and will be completed mid-March 2002.  At a gas price of $2.50 and, working gas volume of 6 bcf, the total cash need for working gas will be approx. $15MM.

We are working with Bridgeline to find other sources of financing for the working gas that would enable them to make (and accelerate) the 2001 cash distribution to the partners.  Alternatives we are considering to fund the working gas: (i) increase the revolver from $35MM to $70MM,  (ii) find third parties (Enron ?) to enter into park-and-lend arrangements that would give Bridgeline the physical gas they need to dewater the facility without having to pay cash for it.   Most options will require Chevron/Texaco approval, which may come at a price.

I will distribute the cash flow statement when I receive it and Jean and I will meet with Randy and Trevor next week to discuss alternative financing/park-and-lend arrangements.   I have been cloaking my questions on the need for cash under the guise of putting together the 2002 plan (budget, headcount, capital needs, insurance requirements, etc.).  We should adhere to this commercial context so that we don't provide leverage to Bridgeline and Chevron/Texaco in any commercial discussions.  I will admit, however, given the headlines, it does not take a genius to figure out we need cash.

Regards,
Brian

It is possible that ABB will raise the subject of our option with them for the construction of the HVDC tie while in our meeting tomorrow.

As you know, we paid a considerable sum in the past for this option, which effectively expires at the end of November.

Under current market conditions, I think it will be possible to pay a much lower sum - and in fact, I think we can apply this sum against the ABB contracted project cost in the event we proceed. 

No decisions are needed on this tomorrow, and it might not even come up - but clearly, we've kept these guys hanging on the line for some time now and I expect that realistically we will not be in a position to give them a Notice to Proceed until middle of next year, given contracting and Presidential Permit issues.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

This meeting is to discuss the procedure on receiving and paying cash out of Enron Corp, ENA , or any other entity controlled by these companies.
 
Please plan to attend this meeting today, December 5, 2001 at 5pm in ESC 05990 Conference Room.",,,Bankruptcy Protection Enron Corp ENA
1269,"To All Employees:

This morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:

-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.


-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.

-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.

-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.

These are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.

As you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.

For our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.

I know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.

When decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.

On behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.

We just wanted to take a moment of your time to invite you to the EWS Brown Bag that we will be hosting this Thursday, October 18th at 11:30am, 5C2. We have performed work for the majority of you either directly or indirectly, and we really appreciate your support. We would also really enjoy the opportunity to update you on what we are doing now, and how we have greatly enhanced our capabilities and increased the quality of our product.

We have invested a great deal in upgrades to our GIS software and geographic datasets, purchased a large plotter, and hired another 'map guy'. We are currently working on projects throughout Enron, and we are collecting Enron commodity-related geographic data and developing map-based applications that could be beneficial to many groups.  We will be giving demos of these applications and much, much more.

We would like to present to you our current status, and also discuss the support that we can provide to take your business to the next level. Please try to attend on Thursday, and spread the word to others that could realize the value of our geographic information services.

Thanks, and we look forward to seeing you there.

Louise,

I spoke with Tom Byargeon this morning while he was at the Offshore Technical conference.  He has spoken with Rick Fowler, Dominion, and plans on visiting him in New Orleans next week.  The highlights from the conversations are as follows :
?	By the end of this week or next, he will have information on two more total depth wells that have been drilled.  Based on the rumor mill, the reserves associated with the Devil's Tower acreage are looking even more promising.  However, nothing is definite until all data is received.
?	Based on the well data, Rick has three financing options :
?	Negotiate exclusively with a company like Enron
?	Synthetic lease financing with a commercial bank
?	Rebid
?	Since Dominion is now 80% owner in Devil's Tower (bought out Mariner's 20%), the credit profile of the project looks better.  (Pioneer is the other 20%.)  Rick realizes his mistake going with a company that has no equity backing and has egg on his face with upper management.  My concern is that based on his experience, he will take the easy way out and align himself with a commercial bank.
?	Enron has the following in their favor:
?	Convergent and Enron's bid were very similar except Convergent had Aker.  (Dominion wanted a guarantee of an Aker spar.) Tom has spoken with Bob O'Sullivan from Aker and he is interested in aligning himself with Enron.  As such, we can bring Aker back to the table.
?	Dominion wants to spend dollars on ""steel"" for the project by the end of June.  As such, Dominion will have to make a decision quickly because it will affect whether Devil's Tower becomes an on-balance or off-balance sheet transaction.  I think that Dominion would prefer an off balance sheet deal.
?	Dominion won't rebid because the other counterparties were not competitive relative to Enron or Convergent.


So, I think our true competition is against a commercial bank for synthetic lease financing.  Either way,  we will have an answer quickly and since the gossip on Convergent is out, I think it will stregthen our position on other spar bids (ie., Medusa).

Stocks Close Higher As Investors Cheer Earnings News
By Peter Edmonston

10/22/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
The Wall Street Journal Online 
Stocks rallied sharply Monday despite the widening anthrax scare, as a batch of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 172.92, or 1.9%, to close at 9377.03 after gaining 40.89 points Friday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.75, or 2.2%, to 1708.06 after climbing 18.59 points in the previous session. 
Other major stock indexes gained ground Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 16.42 to 1089.90, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 7.13 to 561.45, and the Russell 2000 Index gained 4.80 to 430.50. 
Bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened. 
The stock market's gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in Washington, D.C., was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation. Additionally, two other postal workers in Washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment. 
But stocks took the anthrax reports in stride, suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants, some analysts said Monday. ""The market is really shrugging off this news,"" said Mark Donahoe, a managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 
Upbeat earnings news from American Express, released Monday afternoon, seemed to give stocks an additional lift. 
Investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and U.S. military maneuvers in Afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results, said Steven Kroll Sr., managing director at Monness, Crepsi & Hardt. 
The uncertainty on the global front ""looks like it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair,"" Mr. Kroll said. ""I think stocks will revert back to being earnings-driven."" 
Although dismal by ordinary standards, last week's flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors, who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations. ""The markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings,"" said Mr. Donahoe of U.S. Bancorp. That resilience might be giving hope to investors this week, he added. 
Still, investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up, Mr. Kroll argued. 
Third-quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on Monday, with big companies such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and U.S. Steel posting results that met or topped analysts' estimates. 
The Dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p.m. EDT when index component American Express reported earnings that, excluding certain items, beat Wall Street previously lowered estimates. 
The financial-services concern posted net income of $298 million, or 22 cents a share, down 60% from $737 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the September 11 attacks, American Express said it would have earned $595 million, or 45 cents a share, for the latest quarter. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Shares of American Express surged after the quarterly earnings release, closing up 3.4% at $30.32. 
Chip stocks helped lead the Nasdaq composite higher, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5.4%. The rally seemed to be a continuation of Friday's gains in the sector, sparked by positive earnings news from KLA-Tencor. 
U.S. Steel, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, said it swung to a third-quarter loss from a profit a year earlier, hurt by oversupply and a weak economy. But excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another, U.S. Steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Shares of U.S. Steel rose 9.7% to $14.74. 
Investors also sent 3M shares nearly 5% higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by Wall Street estimates, despite a 21% decline in net income. And oil producers Conoco and USX-Marathon Group handily beat analysts' forecasts. 
But not all the earnings news was cheery. Local phone company SBC Communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates. Shares of SBC, a component of the Dow industrials, fell 5.1% to $41.40. 
Meanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging, some analysts noted. On Monday, 3M guided Wall Stret's earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter, and a top executive at U.S. Steel told analysts that the company's fourth quarter would be ""difficult."" 
Companies ""are meeting third quarter expectations, but they are talking down the fourth quarter,"" said Mr. Kroll of Monness Crespi & Hardt. He said that some of the rise in Monday's markets might be a carryover from Friday's buying activity related to the expiration of U.S. stock option and index option contracts, an event known as ""double witching."" 
One of the hardest-hit stocks on Monday was Enron, an energy concern that said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. Shares of Enron plunged 21% to $20.65. 
Overseas, stocks closed higher. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained 1.1%, while Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 2%. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.3%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 0.3% lower. 
In economic news, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0.5% in September, matching the estimates of economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. The index -- a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy -- included some data gathered after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The decline, which was the index's largest one-month drop since January 1996, confirmed that the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy is deepening, the Conference Board said. Falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the September reading. 
In August, the leading-indicators index slipped 0.1%, less than the previous estimate of a 0.3% decline. Even so, the back-to-back declines paint a bleak economic picture, said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. 
The two-month decline in the index suggests that the already-weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year, Mr. Goldstein said. The overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown. 
In major U.S. market action: 
Stocks rose. On the Big Board, where 1.09 billion shares were traded, 1,813 stocks rose and 1,291 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.49 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds were mixed. The 10-year Treasury note rose less than 1/16 point Monday, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 4.618%. The 30-year bond fell 1/16 point to yield 5.364%. 
The dollar rose. The dollar bought 122.56 yen, compared with 121.20 yen late Friday. The euro traded at 89.18 U.S. cents, down from 89.84 cents late Friday.

Enron Faces Holder Suit From Fincl Chief Pacts

10/22/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A shareholder of Enron Corp. (ENE) filed a derivative suit in Texas court alleging that Enron's board breached their fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. 
In a press release Monday, a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest.
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars. 
On Oct. 16, Enron announced that it will take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested additional information regarding the limited partnerships. 
On Oct. 19, The Wall Street Journal reported that Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in Dec. 1999 principally to do business with Enron. 
Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments. 
Enron's New York Stock Exchange listed shares fell to a 52-week low on Monday following news that the SEC requested additional information. 
A spokeswoman from Enron said the company has not seen the lawsuit and it does not comment on pending litigation.

Shapiro Haber & Urmy Files Class Action on Behalf of Purchasers of Enron Corporation Stock (NYSE: ENE) in The Period From July 13, 2001 Through October 16, 2001

10/22/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)
BOSTON, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP has filed a class action suit alleging securities fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division), 515 Rusk Ave., Houston, Texas 77002, against Enron Corporation (""Enron"") (NYSE: ENE) and certain of its officers and directors. 
The case was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period from July 13, 2001 through October 16, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").
The complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""the Exchange Act""), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that defendants' wrongful conduct artificially inflated the price of Enron common stock during the Class Period. The complaint charges that the defendants misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning the Company's financial transactions with two partnerships established by Enron's Chief Financial Officer, which resulted in substantial losses to Enron and a reduction in shareholders' equity of over $1 billion. The price of Enron's common stock plummeted over 20% in just three trading days following disclosure of the financial losses resulting from Enron's dealings with these partnerships. 
Plaintiff seeks to recover damages suffered by class members and is represented by the law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP, which has successfully prosecuted numerous securities class actions on behalf of defrauded investors. More information about the firm and its qualifications is available on the firm's website at www.shulaw.com. 
If you are a member of the class described above, you may wish to join the action. You may move the court to serve as a lead plaintiff no later than December 21, 2001.

 QFs are contingent on the legislatures' approval of the MOU.  In a move to=
 publicize their cooperation and facilitate this process, today the CPUC pa=

 with the CPUC posing no hindrance to stabilizing SoCal Ed., the legislatur=

if it appears that no legislative solution can be achieved, the QFs could f=
ile involuntary bankruptcy against SoCal.  Yesterday's decision raised the =
state's price cap on the QF's substantially, and ought to help increase pro=
duction.  So once again, price caps have kept crucial power generation asse=
ts off the market.  Sources note that the QFs contracts with SoCal now have=
 cancellation clauses built into them in the event of SoCal filing involunt=
arily- this is something the QFs learned from the experience of PG&E's fili=
ng and Judge Montali's subsequent rulings.  The financial question about th=
ese payments to QFs is less whether they will in and of themselves bankrupt=
 Edison, than it is whether other creditors force Edison into bankruptcy ra=
ther than see that money leave the building. The sums in question are not h=
uge, an absolute maximum of $50 million, but we are told some bondholders m=
ay well consider $50 million to be a sum worth fighting for.

Edison International (EIX) has issued a $1.2 billion bond via its Mission E=
nergy subsidiary, proceeds of which will be used to pay off certain credit =
lines with banks. Sources report that paying off these credit lines will ne=
gate cross-default clauses in those lines, and insulate EIX from the effect=
s of a bankruptcy at Southern California Edison. This is exactly what PG&E =
did a few weeks before filing Chapter 11, and has further convinced a lot o=
f people that the game plan at EIX includes letting SCE file and restructur=

Montali approved large bonuses for PG&E senior management after PG&E's fili=

California State Budget:

 the issuance of $12.5 billion in ""Power Bonds."" Financial market participa=
nts are still questioning whether the State of California is illegally decl=
aring itself to be a senior creditor of the one (soon probably two) bankrup=
t utilities. By declaring that CPUC rate hikes be directed first to holders=
 of ""Power Bonds"" rather than general creditors of the utilities, the State=

1307,"Enron may have to pay the CAISO $86 million in erroneous imbalance energy charges due to an EES data submission error.  The CAISO would then pay us the money back on June 19th.  I have already discussed this with a few people and am documenting a basic summary for those people who will have to get involved over the next few days if the CAISO board determines that we have to pay the money.  

Here is the summary:

EES submitted meter data to EPMI in kWh rather than MWh for one or more accounts for March CAISO activity.
This made EES appear to have underscheduled their load in March by a large amount.  The charges associated with this underscheduling total approximately $86 million.
EES has subsequently submitted the proper data which has been forwarded to the CAISO.
CAISO staff is fully aware of the error and understands that we don't owe them $86 million.  However, the tariff states that we should do a preliminary settlement on the data that was submitted and then a final settlement using the accurate data.
Per the tariff, we would owe them $86 million on Thursday May 31st at 10:00 AM PPT.  They would then refund the money to us on June 19th when Final Settlement payments go out.
The CAISO staff is taking two proposals to the CAISO Board today.  The Board could elect to do either of these, or strictly adhere to the tariff.  The first option is to allow us to re-submit our preliminary meter data with the right data.  The second option would be to pay them the $86 million but to keep it in some sort of escrow account until June 19th when they would pay it back.

Let's hope for the best with the CAISO board meeting today.  I'll will let everyone know what the outcome is and then we can formulate a plan.",,$86 million approximately $86 million,Enron EES CAISO EPMI Final Settlement the CAISO Board

1321,"Susie Lewis in Exxon-Mobil's Public Affairs Department called me today
for an update on The Center's capital campaign.

Terry Koonce has just passed on to her The Center's funds solicitation
packet for consideration and Susie wanted to know how corporations,
other than Enron, are responding to The Center's request.

I indicated to her that the follow-up calling was just beginning and
that as soon as I could give her an update, I would.  I tried to get
information from her regarding Exxon-Mobil's take on the request.  She
hesitated a bit.  I said that the request was for an effort of the
business community that was unprecedented in the history of Houston.
She agreed and said that Exxon-Mobil has two guiding factors in funding
any effort:  1) the potential for impact on E-M business 2) the
philanthropic value.  She went on to indicate that attracting workforce
to the Houston region was a key necessity of E-M.  She also agreed that
unless this region had a plan, it would be left behind.  She was upbeat,
asked intelligent questions and appeared genuinely interested in and
enthusiastic about The Center's efforts.  She has asked that I call her
back next week.

In addition, Dennis Winkler, Manager, Community Relations - Houston for
Shell (and Partnership liaison for Steve Miller) approached me at the
Partnership's board meeting on Tuesday to chat about The Center.  He
mentioned the fact that Steve Miller had asked him to go to Shell's
Foundation and put Center for Houston's Future in line to receive
funding.  Note:  Dennis did this prior to our solicitation packet being
mailed.

I asked Dennis if Steve had received The Center's solicitation packet
and if so, had Dennis heard any comment.  He said that he didn't know,
but asked for a copy of the packet.  This was sent to him.  I am setting
up a lunch with Dennis next week at his request to talk about The
Center.

Please let me know how to proceed. At this point, I have not received
the final list of your calling preferences.  If I can fill-in or
customize the list for you to facilitate your follow-up telephone
calling effort, please let me know.  I would be more than glad to help.

1.	Introduction

Retailers had been showing strength on the Big Chart heading
into Thanksgiving and this week, the sector is analyzed to
see whether or not the momentum was justified.  Conversely,
fast food restaurants continued to fall in the rank as
investors seek out companies with higher rates of expected
growth.

____________________________________________________________

2.	Groups That Are Heating Up

Retail/Stores/Discount {.RDI} and Retail/Stores/Mail
Order-Catalogs {.RMC} were both showing upward momentum
heading into the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and early signs
suggest that this trend was warranted.  Preliminary reports
out of retailers and TeleCheck Services show that business
was stronger than expected.  Wal-Mart {WMT} generated over
$1.25 billion in revenues on Friday, a record for the
company, while TeleCheck is suggesting that same-store sales
for U.S. retailers increased 2.4 percent over the same day a
year ago.  Internet retailers also saw strong sales volume;
the Wall Street Journal reported this morning that revenues
on Saturday were over 50 percent higher than on the past
several Saturdays.  Should the holiday shopping season
continue to be stronger than expected, stock such as Tuesday
Morning {TUES}, K-Mart {KM}, Williams-Sonoma {WSM}, Dollar
Tree Stores {DLTR} and Lands End {LE} could add onto their
recent price gains.

The resurgence of Computer/Computer Services {.DSE}, a group
that has increased in rank for seven consecutive weeks, has
attracted investors back to foreign-owned tech firms such as
Wipro Ltd. {WIT}, Satyam Computer Services {SAY}, and Terra
Networks {TRLY} - the owner of web portal Lycos.  WIT and
SAY have been rising on optimism that their entry into
Singapore will help to offset declining profits caused by
the weak U.S. economy.  Both companies have better cost
structures than their Singapore rivals and therefore are
using price cuts to win business.  TRLY rose on news that it
is instituting mandatory time off for most of its Lycos
employees between Christmas and New Year's as a cost-saving
measure.  Employees will be required to either use vacation
time or take unpaid leave for that period.

Other groups with rising rankings include
Broadcasting/Programming {.BPE}, Computer/Peripherals {.DPE},
Electronics/Office Equipment {.OFF}, Finance/Leasing {.FLE},
Retail/Stores/Department {.RDE}, and Transport/Cargo-Charter
{.ACC}.

____________________________________________________________

3.	Groups That Are Cooling Off

Food/Serving/Fast Foods {.FFF} extended its streak of
declining rank to six consecutive weeks.  Notably, Pappa
Johns {PZZA}, Tricon Global {YUM}, and McDonald's {MCD} all
charted notable losses on November 19, despite a lack of
news.  The general malaise that is affecting the group most
likely stems from a shift in posture among investors from
lower valuation/defensive stocks to higher valuation/high
growth stocks.

Other groups with declining rankings include Basic/Uranium
{.MUR}, Building/Brick-Cement {.BBC}, Home/Furnishings
{.HOM}, and Machinery/Specialties {.MSP}.

____________________________________________________________

4.	On The Radar Screen This Week

Retail/Stores/Department {.RDE} should be interesting to
watch this week.  The group's rank has increased for four
consecutive weeks, but may be at risk of reversing back
downward.  The reason for this is that early data about
weekend shopping indicates that traffic at department stores
in general was weak and that same store sales fell.  Such a
decline is not surprising, however, given consumers'
preference for bargains and lingering fears about a
potential terrorist strikes aimed at one or more shopping
malls.

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stocks finished the day lower after engaging in some jitterbugging
that would have left anyone winded. The final twist came in the last
hour of trading, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average went from a 60
point gain to a one point loss after the Senate said it would likely
shelve the economic stimulus bill that president George W. Bush said
would hasten the economy's recovery.

Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle said neither Republicans nor
Democrats had enough votes to win approval for their competing
measures, so he would likely withdraw it. A lot of companies were
counting on some kind of fiscal stimulus to give their operations a
boost, a kind of extra push toward profitability. ""Now some people
have to recalibrate their expectations,"" said Scott Curtis, head of
trading at Credit Lyonnais.

It seemd when stocks reached a certain sell-off point, investors came
in and shares rose. But other investors, eager to book any kind of
profit, almost just as quickly crowded in to sell, leaving stocks in
seesaw mode. That kind of action does not bode well for putting
together anything sustainable to the upside, Curtis said. ""You have
to be more short-term oriented right now, going for nickels and
dimes, not dollars."" (Dow Jones)

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

Debt futures bounced back on short covering late in the session to
finish slightly mixed after Senate majority leader Tom Daschle
indicated that an economic stimulus bill would probably be shelved.
That prompted some uncertainty about how strong an economic recovery
the market should expect. Previously, debt prices had been hurt by an
auction that was described by analysts as ""poorly received"" and
""ugly,"" as well as by strength in equities around the time of the
auction.

While there was a de-linkage between the stock and Treasury markets
late in the session, the link was beginning to return just ahead of
the close and continued in after-hours electronic trading, sources
said.

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

No report today.

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

Crude oil and energy products futures closed lower but off their lows
Tuesday amid late technical short covering and talk of Venezuela
curbing its refinery output significantly. The state-owned oil
company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA said earlier that it was planning
to shut its 108,000 barrel-per-day fluid catalytic cracker at its
Amuay refinery for routine maintenance for one month in early
February. Reports said the unit could shut on Friday.

""It did have the look of a refinery shutdown,"" said John Kilduff, an
analyst at Fimat USA Inc. of the price surge at the close. But he
emphasized that locals were behind the last minute buying in an
attempt to break resistance at $20.06/bbl. In the afternoon session,
crude came off its lows on news that Iraqi exports were steady at
1.93 million barrels a day in the week ended Feb. 1. However, Iraqid
oil exports were down about 25% to 1.5 mln bn/d over the last two
months. (OsterDowJones)

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

In erratic trading Tuesday, the dollar firmed broadly as fears of
another dollar-weakening selloff in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
proved to be unfounded. Traders continue to suggest that the currency
market favors the dollar, with Monday's euro and yen gains just a
brief reversal within a dollar uptrend. ""It's been whippy, but the
general trend is that you should be buying dollars,"" said Joe
Francomano, vice president of foreign exchange at Erste Bank in New
York.

Tuesday, the possibility of further unpleasant surprises tied to US
corporate accounting was a major concern for equity investors and
injected additional uncertainty into both equity and foreign-exchange
trading, said analysts. Traders weren't surprised when the euro
initially edged higher overnight, climbing to test resistance at
$0.8720. But the single currency lost momentum and began to ease back
in the face of some solid dollar buying, traders said.

Dollar/yen moved higher throughout the day, gaining about 2% from
overnight lows, as yen-negative sentiment outweighed any concerns
over the U.S. economy and the dollar. Traders reported sustained
buying interest in dollar/yen, with bids from a major U.S. investment

Comex April Gold soared to a high of $299.80 a troy ounce Tuesday,
stopping just short of the critical $300 level, a psychological
target for quite some time. The contract slid back to $298.80, an
$8.70 gain over Monday's close. A torrent of fund buying touched off
buy stops beginning above $294.50, according to trade Jim Pogoda at
Mitsubishi International Corp. in New York.

Wavering investor confidence in U.S. equity markets continues to be
seen as the main driver for the rally, which began Friday from the
$282.00 level. One London- based analyst said a move to $300 would
represent a 6% gain in the gold price in just three trading sessions,
which wasn't sustainable. George Gero, senior vice president at
Prudential Securities in New York, said $300 was an important level
because it's where products have been waiting to sell gold for a
while.

Mar copper futures remained entrenched within a 73 to 74 cents per
pound range Tuesday as profit-taking and short covering continued to
cancel each other out to keep prices mainly flat. Mar made frequent
probes of support in the 73.00 cent area throughout the day, and even
dipped below on occasion to register three-day lows of 73.60 cents.
However, dip buying and further short covering at the lows propped up
activity and eventually carried prices back to the 73.25 cent area by
settlement.

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

Corn futures ended slightly higher at the CBOT on Tuesday, continuing
marginal gains from the contract lows set last week. Wheat recovered
to finish higher, as a recent wave of fund-selling lost steam and
bull-spreading picked up. Ideas were that the intra-market spreads
were due for a slight correct.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

Soybean futures showed no desire to follow rallying soyoil higher and
ended up narrowly mixed with nearby contracts lower after an
unusually quiet session. While soyoil had a record large net short
position in the hands of commodity funds to support a corrective
rally to the upside, soybeans had nothing but an empty news from and
a South American weather forecast that has already been largely
factored into prices (OsterDowJones)

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

Fund buying and commercial selling made for a higher lean hog futures
market that was underpinned by friendly cash fundamentals. The
prospect of steady to strong live hog bids has led to firm midweek
futures ideas.

A couple of days ago, it appeared nothing on the cash side favored
lean hog traders. Now there is an air of cautious invincibility.
""There is no bade news,"" a pit source said. However, a few others are
still scratching their heads over the ""wishy-washy"" trade the past
week or so that left little in the way of solid information to chart
market diredction. ""The market (lean hogs) is up one day and down the
next,"" the pork complex trader said. ""There is nothing to hang your
hat on,"" he added.

Higher lean hogs provided moral support to bellies which ended the
session strong on late-session activity. (OsterDowJones)

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

Arabica coffee futures settled lower amid selling from commission
houses and large commodity funds against steady buying from trade
houses and roasters. ""The funds are just adding to their shorts, and
they are not done yet,"" said one desk broker in New York. ""They'rre
going to get (their net position) back to 9,000-9,500 shorts.""

In the week ended Jan. 29, large speculators held 6,689 contracts in
the CSCE coffee futures market, but when options are included, the
funds net position is 8,192 short contracts, according to the COT
report issued by the CFTC every Friday. This number has led some
traders to wonder whether the selling of shorts isn't nearing an end.

It was a mercurial day for cocoa futures Tuesday as prices jumped the
fence of the unchanged mark back and forth numerous times before
settling lower on the day. Overall, activity was dominated by
indecisive locals and small speculators, unsure about which position
they should hold. Locals, in particular, started liquidating their
long holdings - the inheritance of the previous session's strength -
and shifted numerous times between the short and the long side, but
ended ""with empty pockets,"" a trader said.

World sugar futures ended higher Tuesday as trade houses and
end-users bought, spurring small speculators and locals to cover
shorts. Funds were on both sides. the market began to address the
oversold status after losing a fourth of its value in recent weeks.
The Mar contract settled 10 points higher at 6.34 cents per pound and
May closed up 12 points at 5.85c.

Cotton futures settled moderately lower Tuesday, rubbing out all of
the previous session's gains, but still holding onto most of the
hefty gains from Friday. As expected, many of the large participants
were on the sidelines as the market is getting ready for a busy end
of the week ahead of numerous reports and fresh fundamental data that
could determine the near-term course of prices. (OsterDowJones)

I will cover our model's 2001 performance below, but first I
want to cover the current market...

In Walker MarketEdge issue that we published in early
January, I mentioned the recent trading range that the
market has been in. The top of that range was around  1173
on the SP500 and 2065 on the Nasdaq. Those areas were
important resistance levels for the market, especially on
the SP500.

After that issue, the market made another run up to those
levels...and it was turned away once again as the SP500 made
it up to 1176.97 on January 7th. Since then, the SP500 has
dropped about 4.2% and the Nasdaq composite had pulled back
approximately 7.4%. On Wednesday, both the SP500 and the
Nasdaq closed near the bottom of their recent trading
ranges.

We at the Law Firm of Schulman, O'Connell, and Wood, one of the most successful plaintiff class action law firms have, together with our affiliates, won billions of dollars in settlements and judgments from companies for fraudulent and misleading statements made by them to shareholders and/or investors.  We have recently brought an action against Corning for allegedly failing to disclose material information as it relates to their November 2nd, 2000 secondary offering. If you have purchased shares in the secondary offering or thereafter, please respond to the link below.

We are also bringing an action against Prize Energy, who is in the process of being acquired in a friendly transaction, which we, as well as other independent analysts, feel does not represent true value to Prize shareholders, and we believe that, should the company be shopped around, a much better deal will result for shareholders/investors.  If you currently hold any shares in Prize Energy, please respond to the link below so that your rights will be protected.

Additionally, another service we offer is that, once you are on our list, we will inform you of any shareholder litigation that we are aware of and forward you the necessary forms for you to fill out and sign, so you may participate and receive monies due you.

This brings our fuel hedge thus far to 15,000 MMBtu/d at an average price of 
$3.53 (basis adjusted).  We are evaluating doing another 5000/d and/or 
selling out-of the-money calls and collecting the premiums.

Interactive Open Season - TW has posted an announcement for an Interactive 
Open Season to be held August 10, 2000 for 14,000 MMBtu/d of East of Thoreau 
to PG&E/Topock capacity for the term of April 1, 2001 - October 31, 2001.  
With Topock values currently depressed relative to Needles, we'll attempt to 
add some value to the IOS by giving shippers alternative delivery capability 
at Needles and the new power plant at Citizens/Griffith.

Southwest Gas - has finally begun construction on the new interconnect 
between SWG and TW!!!  Per our Interconnect & Operating Agreement we must pay 
the remaining half of the CIAC, which is estimated to be $442,500, ""...no 
later than 10 days following the date on which SWG notifies TW that the new 
interconnect will be in-service within 3 months.""  SWG has not met this 
criteria yet.

Burlington - Burlington has requested TW respond to an apparent discrepancy 
in the physical volumes we can (or cannot) take from them at the Val Verde 
Plant versus the currently effective operating agreement.  The problem is 
current high temperatures in the San Juan region have limited our take-away 
capabilities and the summer / winter seasonality was not taken into account 
when we drafted the last amendment in January of this year.  We will meet 
with Legal, Facility Planning and Gas Control to craft a response for Richard 
Riehm.

Amoco - We have scheduled a conference call with Legal and Commercial Reps 
from Amoco for next Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Transport Options 
Program.

Red Cedar - Negotiations continue on the FT deal.  Red Cedar has requested an 
option to call on 35,000 MMBtu of capacity in year 2 of the 5 year 
agreement.   Working with Enron Risk Management, we determined the value of 
this option to be approximately $200,000 which may be rolled into the 
contract.

El Paso Field Services - In our efforts to move ahead on the new 
interconnect, we have responded to EPFS that TW would commit $100,000 towards 
the new interconnect as well as require a volume commitment from EPFS of 
20,000 MMBtu/d for up to 2 years.  EPFS is taking TW's offer to management 
for review.

1371,"Pursuant to our meeting, I was to check the posting timelines to see if we =
could make the 1 day category, include 5 months or less rather than less th=
an 5 months.  Based on a recent decision (March 16, 2001) in Columbia Gas T=
ransmission Co,  I think we can.  In Columbia, the Commission approved Colu=
mbia's proposal to establish an interactive auction process in which firm c=
apacity available for less than one year would be posted for an initial one=
 hour period from 7:00 am to 8:00 a.m.   Capacity offered for one year or m=
ore would be subject to an initial posting period of  5 days.     This indi=
cates movement by the Commission to much shorter posting periods for capaci=
ty available for less than one year.  I think we can modify our procedures =
to include up to 5 months in the 1 day posting category.  However, we may w=
ant to consider combining the 3 day category and 1 day category into one 1 =
day category for capacity offered for less than one year.    In addition, f=
or capacity offered for one year or more, Columbia will advertise a propose=
d offer on its EBB one day prior to the five-day posting of the capacity.  =
(This supports a special posting in advance.)   Although it is good to have=
 these internal procedures, what is important to the Commission is that pip=
eline tariffs set forth specific procedures regarding the availability of c=
apacity. =20

The Columbia order also gave guidance on when a pipeline has to accept a bi=
d for max rates.     Columbia proposed that it not be required to sell capa=
city to shippers bidding the maximum rate for a term of less than 12 months=
 until one day prior to the commencement of gas flow detailed in the auctio=
n package.  The Commission rejected this in favor of the Industrials' propo=
sal:  Beginning 30 days before the capacity is available for service, Colum=
bia must accept bids at the max rate for a term of five months to less than=
 12 months.  Beginning seven days before the capacity is available, Columbi=
a must accept maximum rate bids for terms of more than one month to less th=

1401,"Hi guys,

In looking at CRRA's comments to the draft LOI. I have these questions:

1.  I'm not sure what we mean by EPC contract.  Is this referring to the Fuel 
Cell document we are working now, or is there to be another layer? I know 
this may depend on whether CRRA or someone else is doing the balance of the 
construction activities.

2.  He expects one EPC contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple 
contracts. Does anyone care?

3.  Does CRRA get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail 
the performance tests?  We have discussed with FCE the concept of a 
proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full 
reduction as to the failing unit(s) only.  Also, are we planning to mark up 
the fuel cell contract to recover our fee?  Is our fee at risk for the fuel 
cells failing to perform? 

Thanks,

Pompano refuses $10,000 `gift' from Texas firm that wants power-plant OK 

By LISA J. HURIASH Sun-Sentinel?????? 
Web-posted: 11:43 p.m. Dec. 7, 2000

???POMPANO BEACH -- The city has returned a $10,000 check to a powerful 
Texas-based company that wants to build a controversial power plant here.
???Enron North America, one of the world's largest energy conglomerates, has 
proposed a 510-megawatt plant for a 30-acre site south of Sample Road and 
east of Florida's Turnpike. 
???Company officials hand-delivered the check last Friday, requesting that 
the money be used for cultural arts programs. The city manager returned it on 
Tuesday. 
???""While your donation is believed to be a genuine and unrelated corporate 
support of the community, the timing of your donation has the potential of 
creating a false impression and perception of its intent and purpose,"" City 
Manager C. William Hargett Jr. wrote in a letter to Steve Krimsky, director 
of Enron. 
???""Therefore, I am returning your check."" 
???The company is planning to pitch its development project to the city's 
Planning and Zoning Board later this month. Eventually the issue will come 
before the City Commission.
???The company hopes to start construction in April and begin operating the 
plant on May 1, 2002. It would be the fifth power plant in Broward County, 
and the third largest.
???City officials applauded returning the check to Enron.
???""I think their intentions were very questionable,"" said Commissioner Kay 
McGinn. ""The city did the honorable thing in returning the check.""
???""We have been talking about cultural arts. But did they do it for 
something in return?"" asked Mayor Bill Griffin. ""The best thing we did was to 
return the check.""
???There wasn't anything improper about the gift, said Eric Thode, spokesman 
for Enron.
???""The city has a right to its opinion. I would say Enron nationwide has 
been recognized for its philanthropic activities. We want to be a good 
corporate citizen and support the community. These are not political 
contributions. Supporting cultural activities, children's activities, these 
are things we have typically supported in various areas where we do 
business,"" he said.
???When the company built a plant in Illinois, for example, it also built a 
playground in that city, Thode said.
???Two cities near the Pompano site, Margate and Coconut Creek, have 
expressed concern about the plant and air-quality regulators, worry it would 
rely too heavily on diesel fuel. Diesel fuel releases nitrogen oxide, a 
leading cause of smog, which can worsen asthma, bronchitis and other 
breathing problems. 
???The plant would burn diesel fuel up to 1,500 hours a year, according to 
its permit application to the state Department of Environmental Protection.
???Hargett said in his letter that he hopes when the plant controversy is 
over, and the timing is better, Enron will come through financially.
???""Hopefully, Enron will continue its support of the community and consider 
a future donation following completion of the various matters pending before 
the city,"" he wrote in his letter to Krimsky.
???Thode noted that the check was not written to the city.
???""We would not cut a check directly to a city government,"" he said. ""Our 
budget has standards.""
???The check was made payable to the non-profit Pompano Beach Cultural Arts 
Foundation, which raises money for city-sponsored cultural programs. The five 
city commissioners, who will vote on the power plant, act as the foundation's 
directors.
???Enron officials met with Coconut Creek City Manager John Kelly and his 
staff Thursday to discuss their concerns about the plant's impact. Because of 
the area's wind conditions, the gases from the plant's 80-foot stacks would 
blow in the general direction of Margate, Coconut Creek, Coral Springs and 
Parkland.
???Kelly said it was a ""good exchange of information"" and he expects future 
meetings.
???""They're trying to be the good neighbor and get into the community,"" Kelly 
said, referring to the returned check. ""It probably came off the wrong way.""
???He added that he was relieved Pompano Beach returned the money.
???""It gives us all a comfort level we're going to deal with it objectively,"" 
he said. ""Checks don't make the air better.""

1427,"1.   Met with Ron Tapscott, Jim Studdert and Scott Laidlaw, primary subject 
insurance claim status.  Scott Laidlaw gave Jim a letter from Siemens in 
which Siemens says the generator is a total loss (or cost to repair is 
greater than a new one).   Jim will use this to give to the adjustor to get 
the survey and adjusting process going again.   Jim needs a point of contact 
at Westinghouse to get access to the generator and get it unboxed for the 
adjustor to look at.   The generator that is shown in the report is the 2nd 
generator in the hold and is not ours.  Apparently our generator has not been 
unboxed and thus not directly observed.   Rumor has it that the water line is 
not as high on the Enron box as it was on the box of the generator that is 
not Enron's.

In my conversation with Mark T this morning I asked him for the name and 
telephone number of the Westinghouse point of contact for the adjustor so 
that the adjustor can arrange to see the generator.   He stated he would have 
SW PM provide us that point of contact.   I will sent Mark an Email reminding 
him of such.

At the risk of making anyone or everyone nervous- but I think it is important 
for everyone to understand, I believe getting the pay-out value from the 
insurance adjustor is a vital element of the Calpine- SW deal.   If the 
adjustor comes back with something less than the replacement value (other 
than the deductible) because he asserts that the generator was not (as a 
result of the water- but is now because it sat in a box unattended) a total 
loss, or presently is not  viewed as a total loss then SW will go to full 
battle stations asserting the loss occurred when Enron had risk of loss and 
damage.

2. Mark T and I talked status.    Mark T asked if we thought that Calpine 
would buy the Unit.   Mark T indicated that he spoke with Mike Costa and per 
Mike C SW is one to two days away from reaching a deal with Calpine on the 
Nov Unit.   I queried Mark on whether SW has other customers for the Nov 
Unit.   He was properly evasive, indicated that SW did not, but said 
opportunities always come along.  Mark T indicated he questioned whether the 
April delivery would work for Calpine- he agreed that an April delivery of 
the generator would get them on line in time, but as he saw it he wondered if 
Calpine had an engineer in line to build the plant.   In the midst of the 
conversation he wondered whether NEPCO would even have the capacity to get it 
on line given other work.   I  am not sure whether that was a deliberate 
query to see if we were interested in having NEPCO build the plant.

Ben  Summary of conversation-  if we Enron as sure we have a sale with 
Calpine, then I think Mark was saying we can do the deal.   I think the ball 
is our court to flush out Calpine  (am I spelling it correctly?)- within the 
next 24 to 48 hours.

3.  Update on expedited shipment by air.   Cost would be in the order of 
magniture of $275,000  +/-  (versus $30- $50K by vessel) , problem- latest 
information is that as configured it will not fit on an airplane.  We had 
people looking to see if anything can be taken off the generator to get it on 
the airplane.   I mentioned this to Mark T, he questioned airplane transport 
in that he felt SW transportation people would have already suggested it.

4.  Ron and James.   I queried Mark T to determine whether  SW had gone after 
the shipper.  I put it in the context that we did not want to inadvertently 
upset what SW might be doing with the shipper.  He did not know.  I doubt we 
will get any information on that front.

I suggest that Pete Thompson keep the typewriter on this.  We are getting so 
close to the end, I would really like to try to avoid confusion.  

I am also attaching a clean copy of the current active version, and the

to you were so we could coordinate.  Since I haven't heard from her yet I 
will provide these and follow-up if there are any others which need 
mentioning after I speak with her.

1.  The Effective Date needs to change to ""2001""

2.  In Section 2 Landscaping: To avoid any accounting issues raised by 
Accounting, it would be very helpful and along the intent as you indicated to 
Billy, if you would add at the beginning: ""After commencement of construction 
of the Facility but prior to the issuance of a CofO.......""

3.  Section 4 needs to have a global search done to change all the ""PBEC""s to 
""DBEC""s.

4.  Section 6:  Is the Facility truly deemed a ""Factory"" for permitting fees 
or are we changing the normal classification for a power plant in this 
agreement?

5.  Section 7(b):  Will we be charging the City for the easement for their 
cellular tower?  What is the consideration otherwise for doing so since we 
are paying them all sorts of money for the other items for which we are using 
the City?

 Extra period at the end of this Section.

6.  In the Termination Section can we put in the language from Pompano Beach 
which said that if the Agreement is terminated, all parties relieved of their 
obligations and an instrument would be recorded with County (offset to 
initial recordation of Agreement) indicating that Ag terminated and all 
obligations of the parties have been released?

7.  Does the City need to obtain any approvals prior to execution or at any 
other time to execute and have this be a valid agreement on their part?

8.  I noted that there is no Notices section nor Counterparts section.  Are 
they truly not needed here?  Execution occurring in same place on same doc?

As I preliminary answer, this language hasn't been approved by Deffner's 
group, although it is based on language they have seen before.  It was my 
understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen, as 
you didn't want them entering into the structuring picture until later.  We 
can ask for a blessing on the language, but that will probably lead to 
questions about how the deal will be structured, etc.  I am happy to access 
the resources in their group, however.

FCE hasn't seen any of this language.  It was something I pulled together for 
you to look at.

As for FCE's desire to assign in case of merger, etc, I think the language is 
too broad.  In fact, I think assignment by them should require our consent. 
Otherwise, it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring 
a bunch of stuff:  the know how, the patent rights, the manufacturing 
facilities, etc.  If they are going to merge with another company or sell 
their shares, they don't need an assignment clause, unless there is something 
peculiar in Conn. law.  They only need assignment language for an asset sale.

Electricity Distribution Cooperative

WASHINGTON (BNA) -- A proposal by 17 rural Arkansas electric power 
distribution cooperatives that would allow them to market electric power to 
retail customers passes antitrust muster, according to a Jan. 10 business 
review letter by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, which could 
find no lessening of competition in any electric power market. 
The distribution cooperatives are 17 nonprofit cooperative corporations 
formed under the Electric Cooperative Corporation Act of Arkansas to provide 
electric service predominantly to rural consumers. 
Each distribution cooperative is owned by the individual member/consumers 
that it serves and is legally obligated to distribute annually all its income 
to its member/customers. 
Due to the 1999 enactment of the Electric Consumer Choice Act, which mandates 
competition in the retail sale of electricity beginning as early as Jan. 1, 
2002, the manner of selling and buying retail electricity within Arkansas 
will change greatly. Consumers now purchase electricity only from the 
regulated electric utility serving the territory in which the consumer is 
located. Under the Act, a consumer will be allowed to purchase electric 
energy from any entity in the competitive marketplace, and the consumer's 
incumbent utility will have to deliver that electricity to the consumer's 
door under regulated distribution charges. 
The new legislation's primary focus is the separation of the retail marketing 
activities--which will be completely competitive--from the electric utility's 
regulated transmission and distribution activities. To ensure that the 
utility's marketing operations do not benefit improperly from its 
relationship with the utility, the Act provides that employees engaged in the 
transmission and distribution system operations are required to function 
independently of employees engaged in the marketing or sale of electricity at 
retail. 
The act creates an obligation for each incumbent utility to offer a standard 
service package to any consumer who has not been willing or able to secure an 
alternative energy service provider. Distribution cooperatives, under the 
act, may serve these consumers, referred to as default consumers, directly or 
they may assign them to an affiliate. The rates for the standard service 
package will be a market rate, unless the incumbent utility chooses to offer 
a regulated rate approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission. 
The proposal advanced by the distribution cooperatives would enable them to 
create a joint venture to market electric power to retail customers 
throughout Arkansas. All retail marketing activities outside the traditional 
local territories of the distribution cooperatives would be conducted through 
the joint marketing venture. If a distribution cooperative decides to 
withdraw from the joint venture, it may compete with the joint venture for 
any and all consumers. 
The proposal provides that each distribution cooperative would decide 
individually whether to serve its default customers directly or to assign its 
default customers to the joint venture. 
Each distribution cooperative has a relatively small amount of the electric 
power generating capacity in Arkansas, and the combined generating power 
capacity of the 17 distribution cooperatives is approximately 6 percent of 
the total generating capacity in the two areas of Arkansas in which the joint 
venture is likely to market. 
The joint venture is expected to achieve economies of scale that would give 
it significantly lower distribution costs in statewide or regional markets 
than would be attainable by individual members. 

Procompetitive Effects

In the business review letter, Acting Assistant Attorney General A. Douglas 
Melamed indicated that the proposed joint retail marketing venture does not 
appear to have any anticompetitive effect. 
He commented that ""while the distribution cooperatives could be viewed as 
potential entrants into each other's local retail markets, regional markets 
and a state-wide market, their small size and relatively high operating costs 
make it unlikely that they could enter new markets on their own or that, if 
they tried to enter, they would offer effective competition."" 
Melamed added that ""the existence of other, larger potential entrants into 
[the local retail markets] would significantly diminish, if not eliminate, 
any anticompetitive effect that might otherwise result from the joint venture 
proposal. It seems at least as likely, if not more so, that the joint retail 
marketing proposal would have the procompetitive effect of creating an 
additional entrant into retail markets not currently served by the 
distribution cooperatives."" 
The business review letter is available at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/--the 
Antitrust Division's Web site-- and a file containing the business review 
request and the division's response may be examined in the Antitrust 
Documents Group of the Antitrust Division, Suite 215, Liberty Place, 325 7th 
St., N.W., Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20004.

We had a good conversation with Marvin and Bob today regarding the ancilliary 
services.  They liked the strategy of going with Entergy (although they were 
nervous about some of the people we might have to deal with) and looking at 
other alternatives.  Initially our empahsis is to get them up and running 
without delay.  Any other plan would not be prudent. 

They would like to have the LOI reference our plan to provide the ancilliary 
services.  Not play attorney again but....can we add some language like the 
following:

Ancilliary Services:  EPMI would arrange for The cities to contract for 
ancilliary services with Entergy in accordance
with the Entergy tariff for an interim period beginning May 1, 2001.  During 
that interim period, EPMI would solicit ancilliary proposals from other 
control areas, as feasible.  If an alternate to Entergy is identified, EPMI 
may recommend that The Cities contract with the alternate for the balance of 
the EPMI term.

Christi has reservations about this maybe not having enough wiggle room for 
us, and I agree. There are a few other places in the LOI we will need to 
reference the ancilliary management responsibility EPMI is contemplating.

Also, I think this creates a need to have a definition of ancilliary services 
in the LOI.

We have a meeting scheduled with Entergy for Tuesday morning to discuss Enron 
buying ancilliary services.  Further I have called several of the other 
control areas (CLECO, Alabama Electric Co-op, NRG, SMEPA, and LEPA) to assess 
their interest in providing ancilliaries and wait for return calls.

Marvin promised to light a fire under David Hunt ASAP.  You should already 
have heard from him.

I will call you tommorrow.  Thank you very much,

by AL ESCHBACH

What more can you say about this Oklahoma defense? It has gotten to the
point where onlookers are disappointed when the defense gives up a first
down. And when someone drives the field for a touchdown, people are almost
amazed.

""We played okay against Texas Tech. I think we can play better,"" said
co-defensive coordinator Mike Stoops. Come on, Mike! Your unit held the
high-powered Red Raider attack to single-digit first downs. That's two
straight games Stoops' defense has done it.

Roy Williams is the best college football player in the country. He is such
a disruptive force. Williams is the best defensive back ever to play at OU.
Just ask Barry Switzer. Williams keeps on coming up with big plays after big
play.

The OU coaching staff wasn't very happy the Texas players showed up in
Lubbock to give their support to the Red Raiders. And just how did they get
those tickets right behind the Sooner bench? The Sooners have said
repeatedly they haven't been shown any respect from the Longhorns.

There are stories coming out of Austin these days that Texas is the best
team in the country and they are being shafted by the BCS. Hey guys, did you
forget the teams played earlier this year in the Cotton Bowl?

The OU-Texas rivalry is now becoming a rivalry of hatred much like it was in
the Barry Switzer/Darrell Royal eras. Royal could never understand why Texas
high school players would go to Oklahoma. Maybe it was the fact Switzer was
a lot better recruiter.

And while on the subject of recruiting in Texas, the Longhorns may have
moved into the lead on Lancaster defensive end Larry Dibbles. This talented
player made an unofficial visit to Austin last week. For the first time OU
didn't get a good feel from Dibbles when they talked to him on the
telephone.

But a lot of things can change once OU gets these Texas recruits on campus.
The Longhorns have a big edge bringing them in for unofficial trips during
their home games.

formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

1601,"Eric,

Hoping all is well,

Wanted to have a quick chat with you, when you are next in Houston, about the 
Egypt LNG opportunity.  I had a meeting with the minister and the deputy 
minister for technical affairs and both were intereseted in increased 
participation in the LNG field in Egypt.  They are interested in diverse 
off-takers, and are interested in investing in new facilities (EGPC would 
like to own 60% of such a new facility and local/Arab investors can be found 
for the remaining equity).  They know they don't know how to project finance 
such deals, and they know they need a strong international name as an (at 
least partial) off-take.  They alluded that the situation with Finosa, 
although progressing, is not as it appears in the press.

At any case, I believe we have enough elements to warrant a 
conversations--and I have good contacts in Egypt that could help push such a 
project forward.

I received request for our goals on a voicemail while coming back from 
Venezuela.  I didn't know exactly what you  were looking for or the audience 
but i have listed a few initial goals and thoughts for each business unit.  
We are in the process of creating more specific goals for each group for 
2001.  Each already has their own but they are not in a final and consistent  
format.  We have an off-site meeting later this month in which we will 
address this as a group.  In addition, George and the coal group completed 
theirs late last week and Mark Tawney is returning tomorrow with re-defined 
goals as part of the process.

Also, I have attached some new global formats that I received as I was 
leaving the country on some specific items that we need to insure a 
successful year.  Most of this information has never been put together 
before.  I have projected out a 50% growth factor as a starting point and 
will break this down to specific groups and goals to insure that we will meet 
these goals.  As you know a lot of this was started when I put together the

stated before, but have not closed yet on it.  It is significantly less but I 
have not closed the deal.  I would like to own the piece.  Do you think there 
is any room on the price from your seller?  I will commit to you but I can't 
leave a couple of thousand dollars on the table because of my impatience.  
That being said, i do want it and this one is found and ready to go.  I will 
commit today to purchase the picture in this condition for $3,500.  you can 
tell the seller that I will commit with American Express immediately at that 
price.  I don't know if that works for you or the seller.

1630,"Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, 
personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another 
good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and 
assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very 
smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and 
he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a 
couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his 
existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper 
already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the 
short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she 
could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good 
option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary 
Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck 
(advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick 
thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early 
versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the 
marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure 
that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John 
Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday 
afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to 
add a trading perspective?

A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.

1672,"California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don

which will impact a number of our activities at ENA.  Please watch for 
additional information via interoffice mail and e-mail, as well as

The first change you will notice is the receipt of your personal SAP 
Personnel Number.  This number will replace our current use of your Social 
Security Number.  With identity theft on the rise, it is imperative that we 
do all that we can to ensure your privacy with respect to your Social

various SAP functions.

One of the important functions within the new SAP system is HR On-line.  
Within this area, you will have access to all personal information, including 
paycheck information, benefit elections, vacation balances and all personal 
data, like home address, phone numbers and emergency contact information.  
You will have the ability to view all of this information and the 
responsibility to revise it when necessary.

With the launch of this new program, all current department numbers (or RCs) 
will be changed to six digit Cost Center numbers.  These new Cost Center 
numbers will be used for all financial activities.  Training regarding the 
new coding processes has been targeted to all department assistants and is 
available on Wednesday, May 31.  The sessions last one hour.   To register, 
please contact Michelle Vitrella at ext. 3-9767.

With regards to the Devon CA the following are the Devon comments;
 

You should add at the beginning of paragraph 3, the following:  ""Each party represents that in providing Confidential Information to the other, it has the right and authority to do so.""
Whenever we look at a CA, we should endeavor to limit it in time and coverage.  You say that the agreement concerns purchase of electricity in the Carthage area, but in the opening paragraph, the CA states that it is related to ""a proposed sale and/or purchase of natural gas or fuel.""
You should get this clarified to say something more definitive.  For example, more definitive language would be something like ""...in connection with a proposed sale and/or purchase of electricity in the Carthage Field area for purpose of providing power to compression facilities.""
Other than that, the CA looks good.  Thanks.

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

1718,"Just FYI.  I got a call from Liz Orr [Wildhorse] who said per her acctg group 
we have been flowing around 2,700 mcf/d for October and November.   Per the 
production spreadsheet from Jim/Dan, the production has been around 3,000 
mcf/d +/- 50 mcf/d for both months.  This is the same as 3,200 mmbtu/d [Btu 
factor is 1.06 to 1.07].  Our nom on Wildhorse has been 3200 mmbtu/d.

I just found out that our nom on Wildhorse s/b in mcfs, not in mmbtus.  So, 
that will confuse matters.  Per Wildhorse we have an imbalance of 500 per day 
[3,200 mcf/d nom vs actuals of 2,700 mcf/d] - 16,000 for Oct.  Thus, per 
Wildhorse, we need to reduce the nom to around 2,200 mcf/d in order to come 
back in line.   The concern with reducing the nom should not affect the VPP 
volumes, but it will affect the excess volume [pricing] because for the month 
of November, Paul Lucci has sold the 3,200 mmbtu/d as baseload.  Stacy Brewer 
[ENA scheduler] will discuss with Paul.  Thus, if we reduce our nom, it will 
affect his baseload market and he will have to go out and buy gas in order to 
keep his market whole, and prices have gone up mid month.  [Mark Whitt - I 
know this is mixing mcfs and mmbtus and in reality it's not as simply stated 
as above].

In discussions with Jim, Dan Reineke [sp?] will get Wildhorse's actuals from 
their acctg group, then he will reconcile his numbers with theirs, and come 
up with the final actual numbers.  Apparently that will take him about a 
day.  So, we need to wait til actuals get reconciled in order to figure out 
what our imbalance is.  We do need to reduce our nom from 3,200 mcf/d to 
3,000 mcf/d, but Liz said to hold off on that for now.

Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.",,,Enron Federal Credit Union Enron the Credit Union Credit Union Enron Corp.

1762,"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan","Dynegy Stan Horton Ken

1768,"Today was the first day of FERC's ""RTO Week"" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was ""RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets.""  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - She=
 Said Updated 11/21/01 Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday tha=
t indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months a=
nd possibly the remainder of the season, according to the Florida Times-Uni=
on. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need mo=
re time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain in=
 his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Tay=
lor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably h=
old onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep en=
ough bench.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods Updated 11/21/01 Smith's spr=
ained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there=
 is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered=
 the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should pro=
bably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your =
expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't=
 the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexand=
er , RB SEA - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expe=
cted to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal po=
int of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. H=
e should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady=
 , QB NE - Baby Blues Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady f=
or now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any =
changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy sta=
rter right now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy if yo=
u can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may hav=
e to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's=
 status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The W=
ounded Ducks Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed=
 enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to =
return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continu=
e to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into=
 view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hillrods Update! d ! 11/20/01 Mike Riley =
told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Fluti=
e and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""Y=
ou can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this b=
uilding. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win =
the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most F=
antasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener=
 will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His los=
s may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely=
 regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley =
, RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he =
is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.=
  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Baby Blues Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may pla=
y this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practic=
e early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - The Leather Cheerios Updated 1=
1/20/01Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a ri=
sky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 11/20/01 Th=
e Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's prac=
tice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss=
 any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She Said Update=
d 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to sta=
rt against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Cali Bound Updated 11/20/01 Min=
nis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have =
to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01=
 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game agai=
nst New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome P=
athon , WR IND - Xtreme Updated 11! /2! 0/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the =
season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurt=
ing, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting=
 lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/20/01 Dave W=
annstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Field=
er and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Ja=
y is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away=
 and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods Upda=
ted 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be s=
ufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll g=
et a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the De=
nver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situ=
ation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, =
then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE =
- Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis w=
on't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get =
him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Locket=
t , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury=
 last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphi=
a. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this=
 point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any set=
backs, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suff=
ered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after ef=
fects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Gr=
een , WR TB - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to r=
eturn to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent thi=
s season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens ,=
 WR SF - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained lef=
t knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against=
 Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is ex=
pected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin =
, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury d=
uring Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but =
is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has n=
o real value as a Fantasy player, but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley. =
   Giants , DT NYG - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 According to the =
New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee beg=
an giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsur=
e that he'd be! a! ble to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday =
night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you sh=
ould consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season=
.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/20/01 The Baltim=
ore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team=
's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most F=
antasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver i=
s still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's gam=
e against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy playe=
r at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Xtreme Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end=
 Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee sur=
gery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defens=
e and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    Cowb=
oys , DT DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakl=
ey, who was ! ex! pected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will lik=
ely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help=
 keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give=
 Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - =
Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's =
game against Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my =
job,"" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fant=
asy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if a=

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

Richard - I am looking for answers to questions below - I would think Tracy's replacement could give answers to the cost questions in blue -  what assumptions and parameters were used,etc - do you agree? Thank you so much for your help!

Master Electric Energy Services and Sales Agreement

1.1	 General Description - "" You agree to obtain your full energy requirements for all applicable Accounts exclusively through this Agreement for the duration of the applicable Transaction Term."" - are there exceptions?

1.2	 Term  no questions


1.3	 Transactions - ""but we will not be responsible for any delays resulting from Utility inaction, and the applicable Transaction term will not commence until such steps have been taken by the Utility and will not be extended if such steps are completed after the specified commencement date."" - is this extended end date or start date? could we pay twice (if start date)?

1.4	 Usage Adjustments - no questions

1.5	 Utility Invoices - Is the payment to be included? If we pay late there are penalties.

1.6	 Energy Supply Options - no questions

1.7	Other Services - ""We may provide additional services - voluntary curtailment and energy metering - is this included? wouldn't it save money?

2.1 Information and Designations - No questions

2.2	Limited Agency - ""You agree not to engage in any of the activities for which we are your limited agent without our prior consent."" What are these services?

2.3	 Energy Delivery - ""you are in control (and responsible for damages or injury) at and from the delivery point?we fail to deliver all or part of an Account energy requirements, we will pay any Energy Imbalance Charges on account of such failure except? No failure to deliver on our part will excuse you from timely paying our invoices in full. - what does this mean?


2.4	Notice of Operational Changes - ""advise us of impacts to energy usage - 25% of actual usage during same cycle last year or 2 MW - or you will reimburse an Energy Imbalance Charge - how much is that? How do we know?

2.5	Utility Curtailment Notice - You agree to notify us all curtailment orders or interruption orders or you pay Energy Imbalance Charges - how much? How do we know?

2.6	Force Majeure - how would this work? Is this just utilities or could it be force majeure on supply as well?

2.7	Utility Non-Performance - ""If the Utility fails to perform (including obligations to pay amounts owed) we may terminate any transaction affected with 30 days prior notice to you? we will calculate our early termination payment as if we were the non-defaulting party - how would this work?

2.8	Billing and Payment - Received on the day sent due within ten days - Utility Invoice Credits ""green power"" we will be entitled to the credit -  if the credit relates to an element not included in the EESI Energy Price, you will be entitled to such Utility Invoice Credit.

2.9	Netting - No questions

2.10	- Taxes - No questions

2.11	 End of Term Arrangements - No questions

Section 3 Default, etc - Will we need some changes per our current financial situation?

Definitions - Special Utility Charges - do we have any?

General Terms and Conditions - Will we need some changes per our current financial situation?

Exhibit A - Confirmation

Transaction Term - Do the prices vary per term? Are rates expected to increase? Any reason not to get longest term per rates?

Price: Where can I see total costs?

Excess and Deficiency Usage Charges - What parameters are being used for estimates? How complete are our estimates?  Do we have flexibility here?

Special Terms and Conditions - Change Wind to Renewable - probably need two options here (with and without Renewable - given that renewal is additional cost)

CFR you wanted to refer to is part 60 and not part 75. In any case, I really 
do not think that the part 60 NSPS Subpart GG  limit of 98 ppm applies during 
startup and shut down. I believe that we are covered by the provisions of 
part 60 Subchapter A, Section 60.11(d) which calls only for good air 
pollution control practice to minimize emissions during startup and shutdown.

No short term emission limits apply during startup and shutdown. The only 
issue with startup and shut down emissions is that they get counted toward 
your total emissions for the year, and you certainly covered this issue in 
your last paragraph to question #1.

 I was talking with my brother-in-law who is Kinder/Morgan's VP of Corp

contributing their 5,000 MW's of generation into a JV/Partnership to lead 
into a public offering.  We are still under several different CA's with them, 
due to our past conversation's regarding generation.  
 With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if 
Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion  Project, but at that 
time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the 
delivery of the turbines.  
 In light of our past discussions and KMI's desire to exit the generation 
business, this JV would give them the perfect ""exit strategy"".  Also, it 
would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with other 
parties.  I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate 
the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth 
story to Wall Street.

Attached is an Excel spreadsheet with a tasking letter, summary estimate of

sequence of task/reviews.

Looks like with a 12/20/1999 kickoff, we could have ""first look"" review and 
""fatal flaw"" report to you by third week of January, draft full report by mid 
February and final issue by end of February. This assumes Project Sponsor has 
most of the essential documentation available and in our hands by 12/27/99. 
It further assumes Project Sponsor has staff available in Houston to address 
questions as they come up in the review process. Project would be led by 
myself assisted by a  designated Project Engineering Manager to coordinate 
work efforts and report publication.

 

expected cost to be about $60,000 for EE&CC staff/travel, about $25,000 for 
third party environmental consultant (based on discussion with Project 
Sponsor's consultant and the apparent state of permits and licences). The 
Development engineer cost is already covered as an allocation to ENA so does 
not directly hit Project budget. Costs and resources should be considered 
estimated based on our understanding of project and our assumptions of 
available Project Sponsor documentation. We would anticipate publishing 
bi-weekly due diligence progress summaries and would have updated 
manhours/cost expened and commited to the report date.

Attached is a copy of a sample letter which we are sending to selected vendors of Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries as an additional step toward implementing our commitment to conduct our business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards.

We are sending you a copy of this letter so that you will be aware that your vendors will be receiving this letter and so that you will be reminded that Enron does enlist the cooperation of its vendors in adhering to its Business Ethics Policy.

We appreciate your efforts in contributing to an Enron work environment of which we can all be proud.

Dear Sir or Madam :
	Enron Corp. (""Enron"") believes in conducting its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards. As outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics, employees of Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his/her employment with Enron. Further, Enron's Business Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.
 	Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical. Enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with Enron. Enron's auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom Enron does business. Your recognition of our ethical standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

 
	Your business relationship is important to us, and we look forward to maintaining that relationship with you.
Very truly yours,

though he speaks with an accent, he is easy to understand and he is very

difficult conditions.? However, Schultes' natural demeanor is somewhat formal 
and aloof; I don't think a jury is going to like him.? At best they'll be 
neutral; they won't warm up to him. 

Schultes has sued McDonald and SDI in Cleveland, Ohio--apparently some sort 
of defamation and wrongful termination.? I am getting the complaint, will 
have it sent to you.? Schultes was deposed for three days a few weeks ago in 
that case.? We will try to get the transcript.

Schultes is unemployed.? His defense is being paid for by AIG under a D&O 
policy. 

Kathy spent a lot of time on Schultes' response in 9/98 to Bob Walters 8/98 
memo.? In his response Schultes acknowledged a number of shortcomings at NSM 
but took the position that everyone knew all about them at the time of the 
offering.

KPMG wrote management letters in connection with NSM financial statements for 
the year ended 12/31/96 and the quarters ended 3/31/97 and 6/30/97--probably 
for later periods as well, like 12/31/97.? KPMG has produced documents.? We 
are getting them this week.? E&Y also did a special report for McDonald in 
the second half of 1997; McDonald has produced a copy.? E&Y is still fighting 
about producing its documents.? Schultes says he never saw the E&Y report.

Enron came up twice today, not with much emphasis--both times dealing with 
events after the closing.? A memo of Brian's dated 7/28/98 relating to a 
Management Company meeting was discussed briefly.? The report or review that 
the Enron team prepared in August 1998 was discussed at a little more 
length.? Nothing harmful.? To date there has been virtually no testimony 
about any role of Enron or ECT in the underwriting process--just about all 
testimony has been about post-closing events.

Kathy also pressed Schultes to admit that NSM's actual production of steel 
before the offering was quite limited.? Schultes quarreled with her a bit on 
this.

PRODUCT--URGENT

Harry, Heidi and David,

 The above-referenced lawsuit is filed in the Southern District of New York 
by PT Kaltim Rima Coal, who allegedly had a long-term coal purchase agreement 
with AES Barbers Point, for delivery to AES in Hawaii.  In brief, PT contends 
that AES breached that agreement through the use of a bogus force majeure 
letter, in order to allow AES to purchase coal from some Enron entity at a 
cheaper spot market price in September or October of this year.

 PT's attorneys, Lord, Bissell & Brook out of Chicago, have served us with a 
subpoena on Enron Coal Company.  How they decided that Enron Coal Company was 
the correct entity is not something I yet know.   I have been advised that 
Enron Coal Company is a long-dormant subsidiary of Enron Property.  Although 
using Enron Coal Company's name throughout, the subpoena also references 
Harry, Riaz Rizvi, Allen Childress, Stuart Staley and/or John Bowman.  I 
understand that we probably did do a deal (maybe more than one) with AES, but 
need to be corrected if I am wrong.

 The subpoena requests that a corporate representative for Enron Coal Company 
appear with documents on January 8 in Houston to be deposed about the deal 
with AES.

 I would like to respond tomorrow, by telefax, to PT's attorneys and advise 
that Enron Coal Company is the wrong company.  If all I do is stall them, 
however, they can yank the information from us the hard way (assuming that we 
did do the deal in question) and eventually get what they want.  The suit is 
for about $4,000,000, so it is worth the while of PT's attorneys to pursue 
this subpoena.  Accordingly, I need one of you to tell me as soon as possible 
whether 

 (a) we did such a deal with AES during the relevant time frame, and if so, 
the exact name of the Enron entity on the deal;

 (b) who the trader on the deal was; and,

 (c) who has the documents regarding the deal.

Although I have briefly described the information I need, I also need to get 
the name of the right person to telefax the subpoena to for review, to see 
how broad the scope of the request for documents/witnesses really is. 

I would greatly appreciate this preliminary information by the close of 
business tomorrow, Thursday, in London/Australia.  I apologize for the 
extremely short time frame.  I was only given this subpoena last Friday, and 
have spent the days since chasing people down.  Please don't shoot the 
messenger.

1885,"Mark:

Thanks for meeting with us last week to discuss the Pan Nat Transaction.   I 
think we have a strong legal position, however, I hope we can avoid 
arbitration and reach agreement with Duke.  As I mentioned we will be meeting 
with John Sickman next Wednesday at 9:00 (without lawyers).   This meeting 
will be the last commercial discussion before we exchange our ""Initial 
Positions"" on the 21st of Nov as part of the arbitration process.

A call from you on Monday will assist in framing the meeting  
(713-627-5515).  Specifically, can you relay the following to John:

1. As Duke called the meeting, we are interested in hearing their proposals 
on the revised purchase price.  We do not intend to debate the interpretation 
of the contract (does the price cap apply, Force Majeure, Loss of Supply, 
etc.).

2. We have give then numerous counterproposals in the past and do not see 
this as a meeting where they ask us to go away and develop a revised proposal 
on shipping, etc..   We are open to hearing their specific proposals.

3. We wish to resolve the situation expediently and we plan to continue with 
the agreed schedule to exchange Initial Positions on the 21st of November.

4. Our side will be represented by decision makers.  We trust that they will 
come to the meeting with the same level of commitment and authority - please 
ask him who will represent Duke at the meeting.

Again, thanks for your help - good luck with the call.   I will be out of the 
office on Monday and Tuesday, but Jeff Hodge, Richard Sanders and/or Eric 
Boyt can assist you with any details.

1892,"I know this is but a nuisance at this time, but a credible buyer of claims
-- Liquidity Solutions -- has made a written offer to purchase the 3 Enron
claims in the Perry Gas case at 40% of the claim.  Because of the size of
the 3 claims (ENA, EES, and Clinton), the amount of money that this would
raise is well over $2 million if my memory serves.  Yesterday, Liquidity
Solutions called again and increased its offer to 45%.

Perry Gas is still predicting a payout in the 55% range, but that payout
will be over time given that there is litigation going on that needs to be
resolved before all payouts can be made.

Because ENA, EES, and Clinton all have ""allowed"" claims, many of the risks
(and hassles) associated with selling claims is removed.

I have sent the proposed 40% offers to Jim Keller, Michael Tribolet, and
you, but -- understandably -- have heard nothing back.

I just wanted to remind you that this is out there if you have any interest
in liquidating your Perry Gas claims at this point.  Given that the payout
will probably take another 12 months, the last dollars would go to Dynegy.
If asked for my recommendation, it would be to sell them at this point.

I'm happy to give you more exact numbers of the amount of the claims and
what the payout would be if you're interested.  Thanks so much.

I'll call later about setting up a meeting.  Thanks.

1895,"Richard,
 I included a copy of the Berg anti-trust and unfair competition
complaint filed by Tom Girardi and others in Los Angeles.  Tom Girardi is
the single best plaintiff's lawyer in southern California.  You may recall
his results against PG&E, Lockheed etc. where recovered billions of dollars.
He is well funded and has really good lawyers that work for him. He is
reputed to have close associations with many state court judges in Los
Angeles.

 Both Dick Odom and Michael Molland have been opposite Tom Girardi
for other clients.  Dick represented Roberts & Stevens in a complicated
securities case Fightertown v. Roberts & Stevens  that was tried for 8
weeks.   Tom Girardi posted $320M as damages in the case.  He received a
verdict of $7.0M which was eliminated by Dick's motion for JNOV.  Dick is
one of the very few trial lawyers that have gone head to head with Tom in
significant trial and won.  Dick was recently retained in another case where
Tom Girardi is the plaintiff's lawyer.  Apparently, we knew somebody who
happened to be with Tom Girardi when he received Brobeck's appearance.  His
comment was something to the effect of ""Oh shit. Not those bastards again.""

 Not many defendants have the courage to take a case where Girardi is
the plaintiff's counsel to trial.  Very few of the companies that have taken
him to trial have won.

 Mike Molland has also had several cases opposite Tom Girardi where
Michael represented Browning Ferris Industries as its lead trial lawyer in
the mid 1990s in the serial litigation that arose from the waste disposal
crisis  in Los Angeles County during that time. Girardi's firm sued BFI in
those and other cases during that time.  Michael was able to get BFI
dismissed from all but one of those cases early in the process. The other
case was stayed.

 I know we did not discuss these capabilities when you and Jim were
in San Francisco --in large part, because we did not have the Berg complaint
in hand at the time.  If Enron is considering lining up local counsel in Los
Angeles in the event that it is brought into the Berg case, I hope that you
will consider Dick.

Thanks
Gary

Here is what I have right now. Kern has promised to send on a
expedited basis, information concerning their open season and
recent Ferc settlement.

1) Kern is holding an open season for request to California &
Neveda on an indefinite basis. They are suggesting ""no limit""
to the potential size of the project (assuming customer demand)
but acknowledged that 250-300 mmcfd probably is optimum.

2)The firm rate effective 1/1/00 is daily reservation : $0.5892/dth
the volumetric rate is $0.0667/dth plus fuel

3) New shippers willing to make a 10 to 15 year commitment now
can get a rate of $0.42/dth

4) Existing shippers (whom Kern will refer IGS to) that have
indicated a desire to relinguish their capacity can also get the
TDR rate of $0.42 for an 10 year extension of contract. A third
party could negotiate with these shippers (for an additional
discount) and obtain adjusted TDR Kern capacity.

5) Kern anticipates refinancing their pipeline by March 2001; which
will assure TDR rate levels in the future. Kern rep thought

As a follow-up to my early call, a quick note about PG&E. First PG&E
will be filling testimony on May 5th. The topic I am told is Wheeler
Ridge They want a change to the receipt point matrix exactly like
I fowarded last week. They are convinced if a change isn't made to the
matrix the probable market outcome for PG&E,KRS is only 70 mmcfd.
Starting with 520 less 300 of typical Kern/Socal volumes, 50 of
SDG&E volumes and 100 of already done KRS commitments.

Call when you can, I will be glad to review the whole landscape.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the

should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any

 To all persons on the Service List in I.99-07-003 (Gas Structure
OII):

 As part of the approved Gas Structure settlements for PG&E and the
Comprehensive Settlement proposed for SoCalGas and SDG&E, SoCalGas and PG&E
would contract with Altra Energy Technologies (Altra) to develop several new
electronic trading services including anonymous imbalance trading, OFO
imbalance rights trading, storage trading and anonymous capacity trading.
Recently, while working on finalizing contracts to provide these services,
Altra informed both SoCalGas and PG&E that they are no longer interested in
offering these new services.  Altra restructured their business and has
determined that this service is not the right business direction for them at
this time.

 SoCalGas and PG&E were working together to provide a consistent
service prior to the announcement by Altra, and we will continue working
together to seek an alternative service provider for these services.  PG&E's
intention is to investigate the possible alternatives and to present those
alternatives to the parties to I.99-07-003 along with our suggested plan of
action as soon as possible.  PG&E understands that SoCal Gas intends to work
with parties in a similar fashion.  Since it is unknown how long it will
take a service provider other than Altra to develop these services, the
implementation dates for trading services by a third party will need to be
reevaluated once a selection is made and a development schedule set.

 We recognize that a replacement service provider raises a number of
questions such as implementation costs and service fees.  We will attempt to
address those questions as we investigate the alternatives.  Please send any

Quick question, I was hoping to go get my car detailed this weekend and I 
remembered that you had your truck detailed a while back...I was wondering 
where you had it done and if you thought they did a good job ( I'm assuming 
the place is pretty close to our area of town).  I finally got into the 
parking garage and have decided I now have real incentive to keep my car 
looking nice.

Hope things are well with you.  I talked to Darren last week and it sounds as 
though he is extremely busy these days.  I'm guessing the story's much the 
same with you - a far cry from the listless days you two spent in Net Works.  
Anyway, if you could let me know about the detailing I would appreciate it.

By the way, since there's no telling if I'll have the opportunity to gloat 
two weeks from now (Tech in Lubbock is never a safe bet) - and while neither 
season has been one for the record books (except of course for our loss to OU 
- one of the worst in history) - I noticed that unlike the Longhorns, your 
beloved Bruins are conspicuously absent from the top 25.  Oh well, c'est la

The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: 
Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at 
the end of it. The next day the kids came back and one 
by one began to tell their stories.  

Kathy said, ""My father's a farmer and we have a lot of 
egg-laying hens.  One time we were taking our eggs to 
market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when 
we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying 
and broke and made a mess.""  ""And what's the moral of 
the story?"" Asked the teacher.  ""Don't put all your eggs 
in one basket!""  ""Very good,"" said the teacher.  

""Now, Lucy?""  

""Our family are farmers too.  But we raise chickens for 
the meat market.  We had a dozen eggs one time, but when 
they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral 
to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're 
hatched.""  ""That was a fine story Lucy.""

""Johnny do you have a story to share?""  

""Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob.  
Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit.  He 
had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a 
bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the 
whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he 
landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  He killed 
seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of 
bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the 
blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands.""

	As per Will, the understanding was that deals with transmissions were far and few in between and were currently being manually routed, and this was not a feature to be expected with the current version of Preschedule Workspace and so it will not route currently.

	Issue with Deal Scheduling not showing the correct 'physical route' status has been addressed and is currently being worked on and will be released within the next day or two. The ""Edit Strip Information"" bug has been forwarded also.
	
	Able to recreate the 'Edit' bug and fixed, a new version will roll out by afternoon containing the fix. 

	In regards to the West paths showing up when EAST criteria was selected, this issue was found out to be related to a database modification that was made to include the REGION code to all transactions. Creating the REGION field, NON-NULLABLE requirement, in the database required a default value to be inserted and 'EAST' was chosen; hence transactions which were for the WEST desk without an initial region fell into this particular problem.  The erroneous data within the PATH SCHEDULE CONFIRMATIONS has been deleted and all new confirmed paths will now correctly be displayed since our applications correctly state the REGION information associated with each USER.

	I will update everyone upon a new version of Preschedule Workspace being moved to Stage

 ",Asem,,"Corry Preschedule Workspace The ""Edit Strip Information"
1953,"Good Morning All,

I will talk to Corry about how we need our transmission represented.  The format is ok, I just need more information in the path or the ability to put the entire block of the transmission we buy in the -E- cell. I am going to experiment with a couple of things to see how the output looks in the Confirm.

When I try to sort Global ID or tags, I can't drag the box up to the sort area.  I get a slash-zero icon.

Using a smaller set of data does not seem to change the relative speed of the confirm upload. It looks like each path takes roughly 5-6 minutes to do. I am only putting physical paths in the confirm upload, which reduces the data set dramatically.

I have routed MidC for 6/21, the BPA deals left unrouted are 486140.1 and 308337.1.  The original delivery point in the deal is NW delivered, and then we move it in scheduling every day to go where it is needed. This type of deal will always be done, and there are other deals that get moved in the Southwest as well.  There is a WALC transmission deal that is at Pinnacle Peak, and is changed daily in scheduling to West Wing.

The deals missing dashes seem to all be the same.  Here is one example: EPMI(G)SP15-CISO(T)SP15/PVD #CISO_EPMI_5001-EPMICALPOOAPS (22545)-VALLEYALL DAYS HLH DEAL-
Here is how the path should look if the dashes were placed correctly :EPMI(G)SP15-CISO(T)SP15/PVD #CISO_EPMI_5001-EPMICALPOO-APS (22545)-VALLEY-ALL DAYS HLH DEAL



I  still  cannot get my PV sheet to upload to the confirm dbase properly.  I got  the Access Violation errors yesterday, and so end-tasked to get out and logged off and went home.  today, it looks like it is running, but I got the access violation errors again today.  I am going to save the same data to a new file, and try to run it under a different name. The COB sheet seems to be running, so hopefully the error is imbedded in the one sheet.

4.  I know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other EnPower systems.  I apologize if I did not make it clear that this would be a complicated process involving changes to those other applications.  There is currently no plan for including those features in this release.  Our goal for the first release was to replace your existing Lotus Notes system.

I don't remember our discussions making this only a possibility. I remember it being an improvement to existing systems, and a reduction in redundant work because everything would be enpower now.  I would like to explore how to make this part of the release. It seems to me that it would be more work to make it half what we need now and then keep adding to it to get to our goal. 

I will keep testing today, and bring more findings this afternoon.

The Exchange has executed an agreement with Koch Metals Division (=01&Koch=
=018), a=20
division of Koch Carbon, Inc., to serve as the new Specialist Market Maker=
=20
(=01&SMM=018) for Aluminum Futures. The new SMM program with Koch in Alumin=
um will=20
begin next week on Tuesday, May 29, 2001.  Please note that the terms of th=
is=20
new SMM program differ from the old SMM program with AIG:

! Unlike the prior SMM program, Koch will not have any responsibilities=20
regarding maintaining a limit order book or otherwise executing customer=20
orders.

! Instead, during the RTH session, Koch must maintain an orderly two-sided=
=20
market consisting of a current bid and offer quote for Koch=01,s proprietar=
y=20
account on a RFQ basis as provided below.

Trading up to Last Trading Day of Month Preceding Current Delivery Month

! Under normal market conditions, Koch must make a two-sided market for:

(a) a minimum of  25 contracts at a maximum bid/ask spread of 20 points for=
=20
the first 4 listed trading months;

(b) any consecutive four-month calendar strip during the first 12 listed=20
contract months for 10 contracts per month at a maximum bid/ask spread of 2=
5=20
points; and

(c) a minimum of 50 spread contracts at a maximum bid/ask spread of 20 poin=
ts=20
for any and all inter-month spreads involving the first 12 listed trading=
=20
months.

! In abnormal market conditions (as reasonably determined by Koch in good=
=20
faith) Koch must make a two-sided market for the quantities listed above bu=
t=20
at a bid/ask spread as determined by Koch in good faith.

Trading Between First Notice Day and Last Trading Day of Current Delivery=
=20
Month

! During this period, Koch will not be required to make quotes but instead=
=20
using reasonable discretion must make efforts under normal conditions to=20
provide quotes.

SMM Disclosure Statement

! Under the prior SMM program, which required the SMM to maintain a limit=
=20
order book of customer orders, Member Firms were required to distribute a=
=20
special SMM Disclosure Statement to a customer before that customer could=
=20
trade in an Exchange contract that had been designated with a SMM facility,=
=20
i.e., Aluminum.

! By contrast, because Koch as the new SMM will not be handling a limit ord=
er=20
book, the SMM Disclosure Statement will no longer be relevant, and the=20
Exchange is discontinuing use of this disclosure statement for the new=20
Aluminum SMM program with Koch.

I would change the $64 million to $45.6 million for Rate & Currency.  The $45.6 is after consideration of the collateral posted for GSCM. 

I have not included CIBS and J. Aaron which will require more time because it includes trading positions from several other Enron groups and significant collateral has been posted.  If you do want to include, I would list as 3.3 using a pro-rata spread of the collateral and list separately as harder to get.

We have other positive position where Enron is net negative or more collateral has been posted (e.g JPM).

The Broker Deposit number for Equity Trading should be removed.  We only have about 160,000 left to get back currently.

2021,"Joe - attached is a first shot at getting a handle on all the differences 
between the proposed and existing margin lines.  I plan to do more analysis 
with respect to covenants and warranties but this hits the main points.  The 
analysis between rates will be very complex and may be something best left to 
the research Group.  We can go through why this is such a complex issue to 
model.  What I do plan to do is update historical info. so that based on the 
past we can make general statements such as over time Fed Funds + X bp <,>,= 
to LIBOR + X bp.

A quick synapses of difficult items:

Commissions vs. Margin lines - will trading desk use facility for many trades 
or less frequent trades for smaller amounts
Short on Financial gas vs. Long on physical gas - cash flow differentials and 
how we can model the cost of cash to fund the working capital (as you 
explained to me today)
What positions the trader take and how our equity position is at that exact 
time.  Will we trade in a similar fashion in the future?


From what I understand the trading desks do not have ready access to the 
above  information in a format which lends itself to modelling of reasonable 
complexity or do not wish to share it with us (understandable considering the 
sensitive nature of the business.)  The ideal situation would be for the 
desks to decide themselves whether a line makes sense for them based on the 
pricing provided.  As mentioned above, I believe that we should be able to 
explain why a certain base rate would be attractive but am not sure how to 
estimate the value of a line to the traders without detailed information.  
Perhaps the best division of labour would be for the desks to decide what 
loan would be most valuable based on the desk's trading patterns while we 
could focus on getting the line in place as quickly as possible.  If you 
disagree, please let me know and I will try to rethink how to model this 
appropriately.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook

 As I have been thinking about this problem, my opposition to a standard 
model is declining, partly out of frustration with the slow progress being 
made.  I think, however, that we ought to think about the potential 
consequences of recommending a standard model.  If we simply endorse PJM, 
then we may inadvertently get its warts as well -- no secondary transmission 
market, ICAP market, etc.  I think we are considering the same thing approach 
as was reported by Charles Yeung's in his note on Tuesday's Inter-RTO 
Coordination (Seams) Conference:

""Harvey Reed, Constellation Power, suggested that FERC impose a standard 
tariff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing 
different proposals, but would limit their ability to diverge from a single 
market model.""

 In addition to the standard model, there needs to be a deadline for either 
filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff.  Without a ""feet to the 
fire"" feature, nothing the grand stall will continue.  In arguing for a 
standard model, the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we should 
specific modifications to address our concerns.  On the transmission rights 
issue, for instance, a simple ""don't allocate"" solution won't work.  The lack 
of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the lack of 
information and to the way the rights are defined.  If as Harvey Reed 
suggests, RTOs can submit alternative approaches, at least there will be 
pressure to get moving.  I have not discussed this idea with West Power.  

 It then occurred to me that FERC  is unlikely to impose a standard tariff 
without a rulemaking proceeding.  Whether they could act by fiat or not is a 
moot point, since  I doubt that they would do so without creating a record.  
There are two possible down sides to a rule making.  (1)  The outcome of a 
rulemaking is something of a crap shoot.  The incumbents have a pretty good 
record in the past, of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of goodies such 
as the native load exemption in Order No. 888.  There is a also a distinct 
risk that PJM's ICAP or transmission right allocation process is given 
blessed status, which will make revision of them later to be a huge uphill 
battle.  (2)  The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on current  
RTO discussions.  The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rulemaking 
creates an urgency  to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule cuts off 
options from a new the standard for review.  The uncertainty prior to the 
issuance of Order No. 888 in fact had that effect in the West.  On the other 
hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued.  This 
also happened prior to Order No. 888, with a number of companies sitting on 
their hands, using the time delay to protect existing positions, while 
whipping up State regulators' fears of jurisdictional shift as necessary to 
boost their own position.

 These are only own views.  I have not had a chance to speak with West Power 
this week, but I will approach Tim when I am in Portland again next week.

Steve

2074,"Mike:

I regret that we had a difficult call yesterday.   We greatly appreciate the 
good work that you do and the commitment you and your firm have to our 
company.  Moreover, I recognize that the legislature is a difficult 
environment and that there is substantial pressure on you and Sandy.  I also 
recognize that needs and demands can change quickly and, at times, our RCR 
process can be difficult!

All that said, however, the Government Affairs group has an obligation to use 
our internal and external resources in the best and most cost-effective 
manner.  The RCR process helps us satisfy that obligation..  

From our conversation yesterday and a later call with Sandy, it appears that 
there is some confusion on how we will use the RCR process to contract for 
legal support for our legislative efforts.  Hopefully this e-mail will 
clarify the process so there is no confusion in the future and so that you 
can feel comfortable you are undertaking work that is authorized and for 
which we have a budget.

1.  To begin, it appears from your e-mail yesterday that Goodin, MacBride has 
billings as of May 11 for approximately $10,000 on direct access, windfall 
profits, the ""Global Settlement,"" and Power Plant Siting.  With respect to 
this work, I recognize that there may have been confusion about our budgeting 
and RCR approval process.  These billings will be included in the 
RCR-approval requests discussed below.  

2As we discussed yesterday, the work associated with the billings in May was 
conducted without any RCR approval or any budget in place.  As you know we 
terminated the two legislative retainers at the end of April.  No RCRs were 
filed to cover the matters on which work was completed in May.    

I did receive a budget on legislative matters on May 8.  However, a decision 
was made only yesterday to proceed on a specific matter-by-matter basis.  The 
work in May should not have been undertaken while we considered whether to 
proceed with an overall legislative budget or proceed with specific RCRs.  In 
short, the proposed budget was not RCR approval.  

In the future, any work undertaken by Goodin MacBride should only be 
conducted pursuant to an approved RCR.  If an emergency arises--i.e., an 
issue arises that could not have been contemplated, we can get emergency 
approval for work necessary to respond to the emergency.   Please contact me 
in the event of an emergency.  I can be reached through my office 
line--503.464.7945, pager--888.916.2262, or cell phone 503.539.4733.  If I 
can't be reached, please contact Jim Steffes.  Jim's pager number is 
888.906.9676.  Note that both Jim and I wear the pager at all times and 
respond immediately to messages left on the pager.  

3.  Pending RCR approval for the matters identified below, I have asked 
Goodin MacBride to participate in the Direct Access coalition meetings taking 
place today and tomorrow.  In a discussion with Sandy yesterday, I agreed 
that Goodin MacBride should participate in a telephonic conference on the 
Calderon bill.  

4.  To the maximum extent possible, you should include Leslie Lawner in 
future Direct Access Coalition meetings, conference calls, legislative 
drafting efforts, etc.  

5.  If there is any confusion on whether there is RCR approval for a 
particular matter, please contact me before undertaking an assignment.  If I 
am unavailable, please contact Jim Steffes.   

6.  Today, Sandy is filing several RCRs for legislative support on Direct 
Access, Siting, Windfalls Profits, and the Global Settlement.  They will be 
considered at next Monday's RCR conference call.  If they are approved, Sandy 
will manage the Goodin MacBride assignments associated with Direct Access, 
Siting, and Windfalls Profits.  

7.  Jeff Dasovich will manage all work associated with the Global Settlement, 
whether it is legislative or not.  This does not mean that Sandy cannot give 
assignments to Goodin MacBride that involve the Global Settlement; it simply 
means that before that work begins Jeff must approve the work.  

This particular issue is a critical matter for our company.  Jeff is involved 
in the strategy and business calls concerning this matter and is working on a 
daily basis with Jim Steffes, Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean to develop our 
position and advocate that position in the settlement discussions.  We must 
ensure that our Sacramento efforts are fully coordinated with our strategy 
and business interests (as they develop through the settlement 
discussions).   To avoid any confusion on the scope of Jeff's responsibility, 
I consider all legislation addressing the Edison MOU, any future MOUs with 
Sempra, and ""Plan B,"" to be part of the Global Settlement.  

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  
Again, we appreciate your hard work and commitment to our efforts.

IN THE MONEY: Another Sign Investors Don't Trust Enron
By Michael Rapoport

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock.
Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. 
That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. 
First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders. 
This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. 
Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form. 
But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. 
And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) 
When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come? 
That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 
It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.

TRADE
Zoellick Seeks Specific Date For Vote On Trade Authority
   Trade Representative Zoellick today said the time has come for
the House to set a date for a vote on a bill to restore
presidential trade negotiating authority, stressing, ""The eyes of
the world will be on Congress."" Speaking to a National
Association of Manufacturers' breakfast, Zoellick said, ""My own
sense is that we need a date."" A CongressDaily survey of House
members released today showed 178 members publicly undeclared or
on the fence on the issue. Zoellick said setting a date is the
only way to compel members to focus on the issue and make a
decision.
   House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas said he ""agrees
completely"" with Zoellick and said he would have preferred to
hold a floor vote just after the farm bill was approved 10 days
ago. A vote on the trade negotiating authority measure is
expected within the next few weeks, but Thomas said he would need
to confer with House leaders on setting a date. Business
lobbyists said a vote would increase the need for direct
involvement by the president in securing votes. Thomas said that
would be more likely now that President Bush has returned from
his recent trip to Asia. Asked whether a wartime president will
have the time to devote to the trade issue, Thomas said, ""A
wartime president does not have to,"" because many members are
prepared to help him win passage for his priorities.
   This afternoon, House Majority Leader Armey said the timing
for bringing trade negotiating authority legislation to the floor
was ""up in the air indefinitely,"" saying there were ""renewed or
new concerns"" about the bill. Armey, who has long pushed for a
floor vote on the trade bill, referred questions about that issue
to the whip's office. Union officials have been expressing
confidence in recent days that they have the votes to defeat the
trade negotiating authority bill. ""I think we have the votes,""
said one labor lobbyist. ""We feel great on this one. I haven't
met with one member of Congress who's said they won't be with us.
A lot of those are probably in the [CongressDaily poll's]
undecided column.""
   Zoellick acknowledged that some countries have sought changes
in trade arrangements with the United States in exchange for
their sustained support in the coalition effort against
terrorism, but he resisted characterizing them as ""concessions.""
Zoellick explained that expanded trade opportunities can play a
crucial role in the growth and stability of many countries - most
notably Pakistan - and the United States has a vital interest in
not repeating the isolation and retrenchment that accompanied
international crises in the past. - by Stephen Norton and Charlie

ECONOMY
Democrats Offer Stimulus Alternative Plan With Offsets
   House Ways and Means ranking member Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
will go to the House Rules Committee this afternoon seeking time
for debate on a bill Democrats contend is less skewed toward
corporate America and more fiscally responsible. Like the bill
the Ways and Means Committee approved recently, the Democratic
alternative would provide an additional tax rebate for income
taxpayers who did not qualify for the full rebate provided for in
the $1.35 trillion tax cut measure that became law this year. It
would extend a number of expiring provisions, but only for one
year. The bill favored by Republicans would go a bit further and
make permanent a provision known as Subpart F that aids financial
services firms operating overseas. Democrats contend the GOP
approach on this provision is part of a ""payoff to big money
special interests."" However, Democrats agree with Republicans on
the positive effect of extending the carryback period for net
operating losses over five years and doubling what some companies
can expense. It also provides relief for people who had massive
tax liability for exercising stock options that ended up being of
little value.
   The Democratic measure would focus much more on stimulating
the economy through spending. It would provide $11 billion for
interest-free financing for new school construction and repair.
It would also temporarily extend unemployment benefits for a full
year by providing 26 additional weeks' worth of payments, make
benefits available to certain workers now ineligible for them and
increase the payments by $65 a week. It would also allow a one-
year program that would provide a federal payment of 75 percent
of so-called COBRA healthcare costs. To pay for these proposals,
Democrats would freeze the income tax rate at 38.6 percent rather
than phasing in a reduction as provided for in the new tax bill.
Finally, the bill would create a trust fund for ideas that are
outside the committee's jurisdiction - such as additional
Medicaid benefits.
   House Majority Leader Armey this afternoon said the economic
stimulus bill would come to the floor Wednesday and predicted
passage by a sizable margin. He said he would fight to preserve
capital gains cuts during an eventual conference with the Senate,
although he acknowledged that he had hoped the House would be
able to provide more in capital gains relief than is included in
the Ways and Means bill. But he said the capital gains provision
was probably the only element of the House bill that would be ""in
serious danger"" of eventually being dropped from the package.
Armey said he believed an alternative minimum tax repeal -
although he did not mention retroactivity - and the acceleration
of rate reductions would survive.
   Meanwhile, several Senate Republicans issued warnings about
Democratic proposals in both chambers to include major spending
provisions in an economic stimulus package. ""Unfortunately, a lot
of what the Democrats are advocating doesn't have much
stimulative effect,"" said Senate Minority Leader Lott. Added Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, ""I just hope we don't end up with a package
that just squanders $75 billion."" Gramm warned that if the
package is wasteful, ""I won't vote for it."" Sen. John Breaux, D-
La., said that a bipartisan group of moderates would meet
Wednesday with Treasury Secretary O'Neill to discuss the stimulus
package. - by Stephen Norton, Charlie Mitchell and Geoff Earle

CONGRESSIONAL OPERATIONS
Congress Returns To Work Under Makeshift Conditions
   Senators and staff took a makeshift approach today as the
Senate returned to session, while health and security officials
gathered more information about when to reopen congressional
office buildings. Minority Leader Lott said leaders would decide
later today about whether to ""open up a couple of the Senate
office buildings."" But there were indications that environmental
sweeps could take more time, and the process of eliminating
anthrax from the four sites within the Capitol complex where it
has been found has not begun. Aides said a toxic gas was one of
several options that could be used to eliminate the anthrax, and
that areas would have to be sealed off during the process. Asked
how many days the process might take to get the Hart Office
Building suitable for reopening, Rules Chairman Dodd said, ""Try
weeks."" In the interim, Dodd said he was working to assign space
to senators and staff. ""I've got people bunked down here
together,"" he said. But he said the task would be considerably
easier once the Russell and Dirksen buildings reopen.
   Senators acknowledged the difficulties posed by their office
closings. ""I don't see how you can function really effectively,""
said Commerce ranking member John McCain, R-Ariz. ""So much of the
committee work is done in the Senate buildings."" But McCain noted
the committees have already done much of their work. ""We
certainly can conduct business here, and we will,"" said
Republican Policy Committee Chairman Larry Craig of Idaho. ""It'll
be a little more complicated, there's no question about it."" Dodd
said he was working to try to prioritize hearings to make
efficient use of space.
   Lott also expressed confidence in the safety of the Capitol
building. ""We do have a regular monitoring system in the
Capitol,"" he said. In another show of confidence, Senate
Democrats met today in the Lyndon Johnson room off the Senate
floor, where staff for Daschle brought contaminated clothing last
week at the instruction of FBI officials. But a Capitol Police
spokesman said Monday that no new positive hits for anthrax have
occurred.
   House Majority Leader Armey today would not give any
indication when House offices may reopen, saying, ""The speaker
and I had a very closely held discussion about that"" earlier
today. He said it would be up to Speaker Hastert to make an
announcement. Following the weekly breakast meeting at the White
House today, House Minority Leader Gephardt told reporters that
the anthrax sent to Senate Majority Leader Daschle's office was
""weapons grade,"" implying other officials had not been
forthcoming enough in their descriptions of the substance. ""I
think we've got to stop parsing words and trying to be anything
other than accurate about what this is - this is highly
sophisticated material it is small in size and it aerosolizes,""
Gephardt said.
   Officials confirmed anthrax today as the cause of death in two
local postal workers, the Associated Press reported. A mail
employee was hospitalized in New Jersey, also believed to be
suffering from the inhalation form of the disease. ""We now know
the two deaths that were reported to you now are confirmed cases
of inhalational anthrax,"" District of Columbia Mayor Anthony
Williams said at a news conference. Amid suspicions that mail
with anthrax may have made its way to the Longworth House Office
Building, all the mail in that building - now closed - may be
burned as a precaution, said two congressional officials speaking
on condition of anonymity. Over the weekend, officials said a
machine in another House office building that bundles mail for
Longworth was found to contain anthrax. Officials have not found
the source of the contamination, but they are concerned that it
would take too many resources and be too time-consuming to go
through all the mail now in that building. - by Geoff Earle and

CONGRESSIONAL OPERATIONS
House Prepares To Pass Anti-Terrorism Legislation
   Following a meeting with House Speaker Hastert, Majority
Leader Armey today said the House will take up the conference
report for the anti-terrorism bill tonight, and pass it either by
unanimous consent or as a suspension. He said the House would
move ahead with the legislation as ""agreed to"" in negotiations
with the Senate - even though some senators are seeking to add
anti-bioterrorism language. ""We don't think that's within the
bounds of the agreement,"" Armey said, suggesting the senators
pursue that language separately. Armey also said the FY02 defense
authorization bill should be completed this week, and that the
FY02 Legislative Branch and Treasury Postal appropriations
conference reports will come to the floor as well.
   Meanwhile, there are increasing signs that the logistical
hurdles caused by the anthrax incident - plus a continuing logjam
on the Senate floor - could prolong the congressional session.
Lott said it could take three weeks to move several bills related
to terrorist attacks, plus more time to move the stalled FY02
appropriations bills. Senate Minority Leader Lott said that with
some immediate movement, ""We could get it done before the
Thanksgiving recess,"" but said it might be necessary to bring
people back. ""I'm concerned that every week we stay here there
seems to be another new idea of how we could spend billions of
dollars,"" he said. Commerce ranking member John McCain, R-Ariz.,
echoed that concern, even as he and other Republicans voted
against a cloture motion today that would have freed up the FY02
Foreign Operations spending bill, which Republicans are stalling
to protest what they consider slow movement of judicial nominees.
""I see us headed for one of those omnibus appropriations bills,""
he said. ""It'll be a bonanza.""
   Majority Whip Reid said leaders had made no decisions about
adjournment. ""We're just feeling our way through this now,"" he
said. Added Rules Chairman Dodd: ""I don't think we ought to get
out of here. There's a value to being here that I think is
reassuring to the American people. We may not need everybody
here, but I think we ought to be functioning."" - by Charlie

HEALTH
Harkin Chastises CDC Chief For Poor Anthrax Reaction
   Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, sharply questioned Centers for Disease Control
Director Jeffrey Koplan today about why U.S. Postal Service
employees at a Washington-area mail sorting facility were not
tested for anthrax exposure after evidence of exposure was found
at Senate and New Jersey mail facilities. ""Of course this has
never come up before, but we would hope CDC would have had some
plan,"" Harkin said. While acknowledging the loss of two workers
at the Brentwood facility who appear to have died in the last few
days from anthrax, Koplan said government officials were working
under the assumption then that the risk of contracting the more
deadly form of anthrax, inhalation anthrax, was only from opened
mail. Since the Brentwood facility does not open mail but
processes it, Koplan said, no immediate danger was seen.
""Sometimes the information can't be used on Day 10 when you don't
get it until Day 14,"" Koplan said.
   He assured senators that ""no favoritism"" was used in the
government's apparently quick response to test and provide
antibiotics to Senate aides, reporters and lobbyists who may have
been exposed to anthrax found in a letter sent to Majority Leader
Daschle and the rather slow reaction to rising concerns at the
Brentwood facility. Koplan promised to provide the committee with
a detailed list of CDC's actions to address the various areas of
potential exposure since anthrax was first reported in Florida on
Oct. 3.
   Koplan said the CDC, which is charged with responding to
potential biological threats, and the public health system ""is
stressed through years of neglect and underinvestment."" But, he
assured senators that CDC was working with federal and local
officials to respond quickly to emerging threats. Harkin and
Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee ranking member Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., have proposed a $2.3 billion proposal that would
include funds to acquire and stockpile medicines and vaccines,
$700 million to beef up state and local public health services,
$140 million to expand CDC, funds for a tracking database and
funds to double the inspection of imported foods. - by April

TRANSPORTATION
House Urged By Key Senators To Pass Aviation Proposal
   Senate Commerce Committee members asked President Bush today
to increase pressure on the House to pass an aviation security
bill while urging their House counterparts to move swiftly so a
bill could become law. ""Safety delayed is safety denied,"" said
Senate Commerce Chairman Hollings, who along with ranking member
John McCain, R-Ariz., pushed a bill through the Senate earlier
this month on a 100-0 vote. Without a new law ""the American
people do not have the confidence they need to have to fly on an
airplane,"" McCain said. ""This is the cruelest kind of hoax on the
American people,"" Sen. John (Jay) Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said.
""Until we get an economic stimulus bill, this is the economic
stimulus bill,"" Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said. Hollings said
House Speaker Hastert had indicated to him that a bill could be
up in the House this week, but Hollings said he was unable to
speak with Majority Whip DeLay, who is a major opponent of the
Senate bill.
   House Majority Leader Armey said today there was some chance
airline security legislation would come to the floor this week,
but he said it was more likely to be on the agenda next week. He
said the bill would probably come to the floor under a rule and
that Democrats would be allowed to offer a substitute that calls
for fully federalizing airport ""screeners."" The House GOP
leadership supports language that would leave federalization to
the president's discretion, Armey said, noting that President
Bush has proposed a plan that would leave contract workers in
place, supervised by federal officers.
   The Senate bill would federalize most airport security
workers, would secure cockpit doors, would deploy more sky
marshals, among other measures to beef up air safety. Some House
GOP leaders so far have been resistant to bringing up a bill
because they are concerned they would not have the votes to
prevent security workers from becoming federal workers. Senators
also dismissed arguments House Republicans have been using
against federalization, such as calling for the United States to
follow the European model of aviation security in which there is
federal oversight but private workers. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, said while European airport security workers have
federal oversight and the European government pays for their
benefits, this would not happen in a U.S. system. McCain
dismissed the concerns that have been raised about workers
forming unions, saying the issue ""should not in any way"" be a
part of the debate. Hollings noted that a provision in the Senate
bill would keep workers from striking.
   President Bush continues to oppose full federalization of
airport screeners and baggage checkers, calling into question
whether a deal can struck on an airline security bill before the
busy Thanksgiving travel season. Bush raised the issue during his
weekly meeting at the White House with Hastert, Senate Majority
Leader Daschle, Senate Minority Leader Lott and House Minority
Leader Gephardt. White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said
today Bush continues to support increasing standards for airport
workers, but questions the utility of putting them on the federal
payroll. Bush today urged the leaders to come together quickly on
the bill, but laid down no timetable. The possibility of Bush
issuing an executive order revamping airline security procedures
was raised at the meeting, but the president emphasized that
congressional action was preferable, Fleischer said. - by April

HOUSE ADMINISTRATION
Baird Seeks Support For Emergency Replacement Plan
   Rep. Brian Baird, D-Wash., said Monday that about 40 House
Republicans and Democrats so far have cosponsored his
constitutional amendment setting forth procedures for appointing
House members in the event of a massive attack that kills or
incapacitates at least a quarter of House lawmakers. While his
efforts to gain more cosponsors are hampered by the closure of
congressional office buildings, Baird said ""many more"" than the
40 already committed are ""contemplating"" signing onto the bill.
""I hope we can get this done before we convene as a full body
next year,"" Baird said. Still, he acknowledged, ""members find it
much more pleasant to talk about [presidential trade negotiating
authority] and other matters because they're much more pleasant
issues.""
   His amendment - which must pass Congress by a two-thirds
majority and be approved by three-quarters of the states - would
give governors the authority to appoint successors for House
members who are killed or incapacitated during an attack that
left 25 percent of members dead or unable to serve. The temporary
appointees would serve no more than 90 days, at which point
special elections would be held to fill the vacancies for the
remainder of the term. Baird said that before introducing the
amendment, he decided to excise a provision that would have
directed governors to appoint temporary members of the same party
affiliation as the dead or incapacitated member. He made his
decision partly because he wanted to keep the Constitution free
of reference to parties, he said.
   But that decision did not sit well with National Republican
Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia. While
Davis said he was not familiar with the details of the Baird
proposal, he said it would be ""ridiculous"" not to require a
governor to appoint a successor of the same political party. ""You
should not have a partisan change . [you] subvert the will of the
people when you do it that way,"" Davis said, reasoning that a
partisan shift in the House majority would be too dramatic in
such a crisis.
   While Baird urged legislators to focus on his amendment first,
he also said ""we ought to look at"" other questions, including a
list of alternative locations for Congress to meet as well as an
expanded line of presidential succession, possibly including
governors who would be more likely to survive if a nuclear weapon
struck Washington, D.C., although those questions might addressed
through regular legislation rather than constitutional amendment.

POLITICS
Davis: 2002 Campaign Themes Uncertain After Attacks
   National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis
of Virginia said today that Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have
curtailed GOP fundraising and dampened political rhetoric, while
making it nearly impossible to predict what issues and dynamics
will dominate next year's mid-term elections. ""Nobody knows. I
could sketch 15 different scenarios,"" Davis said in a briefing
with reporters. ""Who knows? The answer is, 'Who knows?'"" Davis
said the NRCC is focused on ""the variables we can control,"" the
so-called ""Five Rs:"" retention, recruitment, redistricting,
resources and record. Davis, who recently had a long conversation
with Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Nita
Lowey of New York, said incumbents are still responsible for
their public statements and voting records, but said both
committees are presently reluctant to criticize their opponents.
""This is an environment where you want to be very careful in
comparison ads. You can give them a little elbow, but you have to
be careful,"" Davis said.
   Davis said both campaign committees have similarly refrained
from fundraising in the month following the terrorist attacks.
However, Davis said the terrorist threats have motivated some
reluctant potential House candidates to re-evaluate their
decisions. ""People want to be relevant. They want to be
involved,"" he said. Davis said local off-year elections next
month - including gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey
where Democratic candidates have the advantage - would not be a
referendum on congressional performance. ""I don't think what
happens Nov. 6 is going to have a thing to do with what happens
with the Congress and the president,"" Davis said. ""There are no
national issues right now that will hurt Republicans.""
   However, Democrats continue to emphasize their differences
with Republicans. In an e-mail sent to reporters today in advance
of the NRCC briefing, a DCCC spokesman suggested ""four questions
for Tom Davis,"" including airport security and economic stimulus
questions. ""Does he believe that Republican House candidates will
pay a price at the polls if [Majority Whip] Tom DeLay and
[Majority Leader] Dick Armey succeed in killing airport security
improvements?"" the spokesman asked. Davis independently addressed
both topics. He said House Republicans simply would not rubber
stamp Senate airport security legislation and stressed the
importance of stimulus package. ""It puts more pressure on a
stimulus package that actually works,"" Davis said. ""The economy
might be an issue that is front and center. It might not."" - by

Republicans To Drop Filibuster Against FY02 Foreign Operations
   Senate Minority Leader Lott this afternoon said Republicans
would drop their filibuster against the FY02 Foreign Operations
appropriations bill. ""We're going to go forward with the
appropriations bills,"" Lott told reporters. Lott said Republicans
are still not happy with the pace of judicial nominations under
Senate Judiciary Chairman Leahy, but have decided that now is not
the time for them to push the issue. The Senate again had failed
to invoke cloture today on the motion to proceed to the Foreign
Operations spending bill, as senators voted 50-47 along party
lines. Awaiting floor consideration are the Agriculture, Labor-
HHS and District of Columbia spending bills, while the Defense
appropriations bill has yet to be marked up.

Zoellick Reiterates The Need For Steel Industry To Restructure
   In the wake of Monday's announcement that the International
Trade Commission had concluded that the U.S. steel industry has
suffered serious injury as a result of dumping of steel by
foreign competitors, Trade Representative Zoellick today
reiterated the need for the industry to restructure. He warned he
would not go through in pressing the issue and ""perpetually""
coming to its assistance unless the industry is prepared to make
needed changes. Rep. Phil English, R-Pa., said Monday that the
ITC's ruling was no ""panacea,"" but has ""the potential to insulate
our domestic steel market from predatory dumping at a time when
our domestic industry has been facing it most severe crisis in
memory."" Similarly, Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., said, ""This
ruling means that foreign producers now will need to align their
capacity with domestic and global demand. The ultimate objective
must be to have the domestic price of steel reflect its true
competitive cost of production.""

Largent Encouraged Not To Vacate His House Seat
   Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., who plans to resign Nov. 29 to
run for governor, is being encouraged not to vacate his House
seat until state legislative attempts to change current law have
been exhausted, the Daily Oklahoman reported. If Largent goes
ahead with his decision to resign on that date, Tulsa's 1st
District would be left without a voice in Congress during wartime
conditions, because under current state law, the governor cannot
call a special election until there is a vacancy, which would
trigger a process that could take as long as 90 days. Attempts to
resolve the issue intensified last week when House Speaker Larry
Adair gave state Reps. Russ Roach, a Democrat, and Mark Liotta, a
Republican, permission to work with the state Election Board on
wording for an amendment that would allow Largent's resignation
not to become effective immediately while an election is held to
replace him. Largent said he will go through with his plan to
resign Nov. 29, no matter what the state Legislature decides.

ATTACK UPDATE
   Britain is sending about 1,000 troops to join the U.S.-led
ground war in Afghanistan, according to media reports today, but
the Defense Ministry said it had made no decisions, the
Associated Press reported. Citing senior defense officials, the
British Broadcasting Corp. said about 600 Royal Marine commandos
and several hundred special forces personnel - currently taking
part in a military exercise in Oman - would be deployed to join
the ground assault. Four British ships participating in the
exercise, which ends this weekend, also will stay behind to join
the Afghan campaign, the BBC said. Meanwhile, former Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook suggested that there was still time for the
Taliban regime in Afghanistan to hang onto power even if it
handed over Osama bin Laden. The government has not announced
whether British troops will join the ground campaign, but says it
remains an option. The chiefs of Britain's Royal Navy and Royal
Air Force were reported Monday to be drawing up plans for long-
term military involvement in the war against terrorism.
   In Afghanistan, U.S. jets swooped down to strike Taliban front
lines and a bin Laden stronghold north of Kabul today, watched by
opposition fighters hoping that the American bombardment will
open the way for their advance. Opposition officials also
reported U.S. attacks around the key northern city of Mazar-e-
Sharif, where an opposition offensive to recapture the stronghold
faltered last week. Missiles set fire to critical Taliban oil
supplies in the southern city of Kandahar. In recent days, the
United States has shifted strategy, drawing planes away from
urban areas to target the front-line positions of the Taliban and
their allies in bin Laden's al-Qaida network which face the
opposition Northern Alliance. The goal is to enable the alliance
to advance toward the capital, Kabul, and Mazar-e-Sharif to break
the back of Taliban resistance. From rooftops U.S. jets could be
seen as tiny white specks roaring far overhead, before they
swooped down to unleash their bombs. A series of nine blasts from
several miles away could be heard.
   Along the Kabul front, Taliban fighters were holding their
ground today, responding with rockets and mortars. One rocket
slammed into the bazaar at Charikar, 30 miles north of Kabul,
killing two people, including a 60-year-old vegetable vendor. In
Kandahar, the South Asian Dispatch Agency reported U.S. jets
struck an oil depot and a fuel convoy, sending a thick cloud of
black smoke rising into the clear blue sky. U.S. planes also
targeted an asphalt plant, setting back Taliban efforts to repair
the runway at Kandahar airport, which has been pounded repeatedly
during the air campaign, the agency said. The agency also
reported that U.S. jets late Monday bombed a mountain on the
western outskirts of Kandahar where Taliban troops were trying to
repair a radar station which had been heavily damaged earlier in
the air campaign.

Pat Wood first questioned why the Board makeup should consist of existing I=

e retained by these board members.  He thinks perhaps the board should be m=

Pat also expressed concern that FERC not take action that would upset the e=

 does not know what the outcome will be and could disrupt the existing mark=

 show stopper if it is not done correctly.  Under the PJM proposal, the new=

2082,"I spoke today to a staff member of the Cabinet of Minister Deleuze, Belgian 
Federal Minister for Energy and Sustainable Development.  As you will know, 
Minister Deleuze will be chair of the EU Environment Ministers as of July 
when Belgium takes over the rotating Presidency of the EU.  Thus he is 
presently intimately concerned with EU follow up to Kyoto.

The Cabinet of Deleuze is taking very seriously reports that Bush will table 
a series of initiatives at the Bonn COP VI meeting, which are designed to get 
the US time to consider a comprehensive new approach to climate change issues 
and will finally ditch consideration of Kyoto (by others). The EU (in my 
opinion) would seek to counter any such 'wrecking tactics' by increasing the 
pressure on the US in the interim (though the sensible political response, 
tabling EU suggestions that the US would have to reject, seems to have eluded 
the EU till now).

The end point of any such plan by Bush would be a US emphasis on trade/market 
based mechanisms, no multilateral approach but bilateral deals, and 
technology transfer.

(If we have any messages on this issue for the EU, this contact would be a 
good input point.)

Incidentally, in Brussels today, Thomas Brewer of the Jorunal of 
International Business Studies, gave a very persuasive account of why the 
Republican leadership is out of touch even with its rank and file membership 
on environmental issues.  He used polling data to indicate this, and the 
suggested conclusion, that Bush will now have to move  'constructively' on 
the issue, was well argued.

Lastly, do we have a contact in Washington who could comment on this?

I attach an outline of the report we are aiming to produce on the current 
regulations governing the construction, ownership and operation of IPPs and 
associated facilities in Japan so far as they relate to EPower's activities. 
The outline also includes an implementation schedule. As previously 
mentioned, the aim is to have the report together with recommendations 
completed by mid next month.

The response to the review from EPower has been very positive so far. We are 
receiving assistance from all quarters within the company. Initial 
indications are that EPower already has a good amount of the primary 
information necessary for the review in some form or other. However, to date 
there appears to have been limited analysis of that information by EPower to 
determine the implications for project costs and schedules and how to 
minimize potential delays. The report will aim address these issues.

Everything went smooth last night and this morning with El Paso and the ramps.  Due to the migration I am unable to send the EPE model to Kathy (file for Feb. did not pull into the M: drive).   I was also unable to get into CAPS (Trading cluster is not reconfigured).  I saved the model through my shift and now that I have logged off I am unable to log back on under my name.  I updated Geir's login last night (upon his request) and have limited access through his login.  Holden is aware of these problems.

 Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have 
joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, 
Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day 
to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both 
Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone 
else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is 
far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want.

How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing?  
I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing 
great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing 
like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he 
has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting 
into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's 
hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are 
having fun.

Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he 
ever wants to play some tennis, please call us.

Sorry this took so long but here are my thoughts on the above:

1. In Section 3.1 (c), I'm assuming that the additional sections were added 
because we will get these reps in another agreement from the Trust.  Is that 
correct?

2. In Section 3.4 e), the new language regarding rescission of acceleration I 
think belongs after the phrase that begins, ""if the effect of such 
failure...""  Also, where did the new language regarding prepayments at the 
end come from?  Is this in the Revolver or in Enron's existing deals?

 In most cases, it is a repetition of what all had done several months ago, and the attached excel sheet builds on it.  You are kindly requested to review the sheet and advise on the following:

2131,"Dear Murray (and Chris),

    Mike and I have been noticing that a newcommer in Houston, Alicia Nguyen, may be in need of some additional attention from the Settlements group.  We understand that she had limited training time with Laura Dewett before Laura left the Settlements group, and we recognize that she is not at fault in her mistakes.  This does, however, seem like an issue that needs to be addressed immediately.  
    It does not seem that Alicia knows how to identify real variances or how to then enter the disputes into DMS properly so that we understand what we need to research (and skewing the numbers that I report to our traders) .  Often times, we have found that a problem that she has identified as a dispute is not in duspute, which can be frustrating to us as well and delaying the DMS process.  We think that with some guidance, she will have a much better understanding of the process and be better able to identify real discrepancies. 
   For examples and recommendations, please see Mike or myself.

   We appreciate you attention to this matter,

  Virginia

2151,"Netiquette.  What's that?  

Well, in case you didn't know, Netiquette is the proper use of e-mail.  
Because we all spend a large portion of our day communicating with customers, 
vendors and co-workers via e-mail, here are some tips to help you polish your 
e-mail skills and send you on your way to Netiquette success. 

Short & Sweet
Keep your messages concise and to the point.

Cluless In . . .
The subject line can be a couple of words or a short phrase that gives the 
reader a hint to the contents of your message.

ARE YOU ANGRY?
The use of UPPERCASE text is the equivalent of yelling in the world of 
e-mail.  Lower the case and, thus, your e-mail voice.

Are You Still Angry!!!??
Watch out for excessive punctuation like exclamation points.  If something is 
important, put it in words, not exclamation points.

We Can Become Too Attached
Think of your reader and, whenever possible, put your message in the body of 
the e-mail rather than in an attachment.

Does Everyone Need To Know?
Be careful when you send replies to ""all recipients"" of an e-mail.  Ask 
yourself if everyone really needs to see your response.  If not, you'll be 
using up disk space, cluttering inboxes and slowing the mail servers 
unnecessarily.

Spellcheck Is Your Friend
Like printed documents, e-mail deserves a review to assure that grammar and 
spelling are correct.

Privacy On The Net?
There is no such thing as private e-mail.  Never send anything by e-mail that 
you would not want to see on the front page of tomorrow's newspaper.  There 
are no security guarantees with electronic mail.

Eyes Only In Cyberspace
Avoid sending any confidential or sensitive information via e-mail.  
Remember, it's very easy for someone else to forward messages you considered 
confidential.  Even messages sent as ""Confidential"" can be copied.

Quick Tips -- Refine Your Skills
Long paragraphs are hard to read.  Break them up into smaller ones of two to 
three sentences.
The use of abbreviations should be minimal.
When sending e-mail outside Enron, keep it plain and simple.  That means no 
elaborate use of formatting tools, such as bold, indent, etc.
Your e-mail signature should be the same one you use on printed documents.
Address people in business e-mail the same way you normally would in person 
or in a letter (e.g., Bob: or Ms. Smith:)
Sarcasm is dangerous to use in e-mail.  Remember, e-mail does not convey 
emotions.",Netiquette Bob Smith,,Enron

In the context of the SFA audit and also your request for info about this 
some time ago (apologies for the delay), I've done some research into our 
current practice and procedure on taping and the position is as follows:

The current policy is to destroy recordings after 6 months.
However, this policy is not being implemented by our Telecoms group at the 
moment which is awaiting confirmation that the 6 month period is appropriate 
(not clear why).  
It appears that no recordings have been destroyed for at least 2 years.
A firm has been contracted to destroy recordings as soon as the go-ahead is 
given.

Obviously we want to be consistent across jurisdictions and I wanted to check 
with you that the retention period in Houston is still 6 months.  Please 
confirm.

Also, John Sherriff is keen for traders to be given guidance on what not to 
say on recorded lines, perhaps with some case studies to provide a salutary 
lesson or two!  Have you guys done anything similar in the US?

I look forward to hearing form you. 

Thanks and regards

Paul",Jeff John Sherriff,,SFA Telecoms
2187,"Glad to hear the rest of your trip went well.  

The 'normal' sailing trip is a week but that's not cast in stone.  In an 
effort to maximize days sailing and minimize days of vacation taken we 
usually fly down on a Saturday arriving in the afternoon or eve., pick up the 
boat on Sunday (you get the boat around noon) and bring it back the following 
Sunday (by noon), take a shower and head straight for the airport.  Because 
of the way the flight schedules work it's usually not possible to leave after 
work on a Friday and make it all of the way down there.  You could do a 
shorter trip, of course, but I never have.  I've gone for longer (we did a 10 
day one-way sail from St. Lucia down to the southern end of Grenada, stopping 
in Bequia and Mustique, among others, along the way) but that's a pretty long 
trip and certainly not necessary.  Most of the charter fleets are based where 
there is plenty to do right in the area for a week.  One of the reasons for 
aiming at Thanksgiving was to reduce the total number of vacation days 
spent.  I get both Thurs & Fri off so I only have to spend 3 days to get a 
whole week - I understand the gov't may not be so generous.  I haven't taken 
all of my days this year so I can always carry some over to 2001 if that 
works better for you guys.

My views on when to go:

January - March 
Very fun since you will be sick of winter, very popular so a lot more crowded 
(harder to find a place to anchor for the night and have to make arrangements 
farther ahead), everything is open for business, high season rates.

April - May
Less crowded (unless Easter or Spring breaks are late), shoulder season rates.

June - August
No crowds (you may have some anchorages to yourself), many places are closed 
for the season (think beach bars and meals on shore), low rates.

September - October
See June-August and add in highest risk of hurricanes 
(http://www.storm2000.com).  My guess is that people who planned their trips 
to the BVI for this week aren't having much fun right now but they got  GREAT 
deals and the Moorings will probably give them a refund.  I've chartered 
during this period several times and had a blast.  One time a tropical storm 
came through and we stayed on the boat in port - I still get mileage out of 
the stories.  You just have to be willing to live with the risk that it may 
not go according to plan (not seriously dangerous, though - you're always 
within easy reach of the base - if a bad one threatens you just take the boat 
back and let them deal with it).

November - December
Hurricane threat drops dramatically.  Crowds pick up around Christmas, 
everything opens up again, rates start to go up again.

Bottom line:  I love the trips so much it doesn't matter what time of year - 
just let me know what works best for you guys.  Keep in mind that you do have 
to make arrangements at least 2 months in advance (more is better) to make 
sure you get flights and the boat that you want.

One last thought - it is possible for the main group to pick up the boat on 
schedule and arrange to be near the airport on a later day in the trip to 
pick someone up.  This is definitely suboptimal.  You learn a lot about the 
boat and the sailing area from the briefings the charter company gives you at 
the start and it limits flexibility to have to be by the airport on a certain 
day when you might rather have the boat at the other end of the island chain 
or wherever.  I'd rather put the whole thing off until we can all go at once 
but if it's the only way, at least it's an option.

Exchanges Note Plans for Launch
Of E-Based Single Stock Futures Market

CHICAGO--The leaders of Chicago's two futures exchanges and the world's 
largest options exchange unveiled plans May 14 to launch an electronic 
single-stock futures exchange. 
Senior executives of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc., the Chicago Board 
of Trade, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange said they signed a letter of 
intent to develop the first domestic single-stock futures exchange. The 
Nasdaq and the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange 
announced a single-stock futures venture in March. 

Ban Lifted on Single-Stock Trading

Plans for the exchange come six months after futures laws were reformed to 
permit U.S. exchanges to trade single-stock futures. Last December, the 
Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 was enacted, lifting a 
prohibition on such transactions for the first time in more than 18 years. 
During a briefing with reporters, exchange executives said the CME and CBOE 
would be the two primary partners in the joint venture. Each of the exchanges 
would own 45 percent of the new entity. The CBT would own the remaining 10 
percent of the exchange. By their coming together in an unusual spirit of 
cooperation, the exchange officials said, they hoped the as yet unnamed 
venture would restore Chicago's position as the world leader in futures 
trading. 
""This exciting new initiative combines the best of securities and futures 
trading,"" said William Brodsky, CBOE chairman and chief executive officer. 
""Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago 
remains the world's center in derivatives trading and risk management."" 

Approval of Boards, Regulators Needed

The exchanges said the new entity would be structured as a for-profit company 
with its own management and board of directors. The company would be 
organized separately from the three Chicago exchanges. The proposal still 
must gain the approval of the boards of directors of the three exchanges and 
federal regulators. Exchange officials said they were still uncertain whether 
the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission would be the primary regulator of the new exchange. 
Exchange officials stressed that the trading activity would be available only 
on an electronic basis. Market participants would be able to access the 
trading via the CME's Globex2 and CBOE's CBOEdirect electronic trading 
platforms. Exchange officials said they hope to offer principal-to-principal 
trading by Aug. 21 and retail trading by Dec. 21.

2223,"Mark the position is relatively straight forward. Enron Australia Finance 
Pty.Ltd.(EAF) trades Australian Power Derivatives under what is known as an 
exempt market declaration (safe harbour provision). There are a number of 
requirements to be met under this Declaration including a list 
""qualifications"" of the persons who can enter into a transaction. The only 
qualification likely to apply to a non- Australian resident is if  a party 
registered under the Declaration (such as EAF) reasonably believes  that the 
entity has tangible assets with a market value of at least AUD10M (USD6M). 

What happens if we contract with someone who does not have this asset level 
and none of the other tests apply? In all likelihood nothing. However, the 
Australian Regulator (ASIC) would expect EAF to have procedures in place 
aimed at compliance with the provisions of the Declaration. We are required 
to report annually on these procedures. We are also currently in discussions 
with ASIC aimed at extending our Declaration to all products traded through 
EOL in Australia. This is to ensure we are prepared should legislative 
changes eventuate next year requiring trading in all derivatives to be 
licenced. Any suggestion that we do not have procedures in place to ensure 
compliance with the intent of our current declaration would be of extreme 
concern to ASIC. They placed particular emphasis on our assurances that we 
are not going to be entering the ""retail"" market and will have procedures to 
ensure this occurs. 

In essence what am saying is that we need to be able to point to procedures 
to show we are taking reasonable steps to ensure that our counterparties meet 
the qualifications to trade power derivatives.  My concern is not with  
Australian companies - there are a number of tests that apply to them apart 
from just asset level.  Also we can handle them from here.But when a company 
appears on Tana's list that is say incorporated in the US and does not trade 
in Australia there seems no way of checking unless some assessment is  made 
of its asset level. I thought this was being done as per procedures developed 
(see procedures attached to following email).  

Rather than bounce emails between us can we arrange a brief phone discussion 
on this point?

An agency agreement has been contemplated between Tokyo and Houston.  I 
believe it would be best to have Susan Musch advise on this issue, as she is 
handling the tax aspects relating to these activities and was also involved 
in the arrangements between Sydney and Houston.  I have copied Susan on this 
correspondence.

As to the netting issue, please confirm my understanding, that the issues 
are; (i) that we do not want different Enron entities (i.e. Enron Japan Corp. 
and ENA) entering into ISDAs with the same Japanese counterparties; and (ii) 
that if Enron Japan Corp. is transacting with a bank, with which ENA has an 
ISDA in place, we would amend such existing ISDA to cover the multibranch 
situation.

I spoke to Susan a bit earlier and she indicated you wanted an update on my 
progress for CL matters.  

To start the ball rolling, I have attached a form of the ESA marked to 
reflect my proposed changes.  As I completed this late last week and then was 
called out of town, I have not had the opportunity to fully review it; 
however, it will give you the direction I am heading.

I also spoke to Susan about other legal issues.  They are the following:

1.  GTC's - I am still not sure how the EOL GTC's can become part of CL 
unless they are there only for information sake and able to be printed.  If 
we use the EOL GTC's, we will have to modify them to be applicable to CL, a 
process that can be accomplished.  However, then we have GTC's for CL that I 
am not sure are useful.  Since all customers have to have agreed to an ESA, 
there is really no place for CL GTC's (e.g., there will be no phone or 
non-electronic use of CL). 

2.  Confirm Central - I am still not sure how we need to handle the 
additional terms and conditions that are necessary for certain products.  If 
the GTC's concept is viable, this is where this language should be placed; 
however, if the GTC's concept does not work, we have to develop another 
method of presenting them.  We could leave them in the Annex and merely 
indicate that anyone dealing with products in the classes for which 
additional terms are attached to the Annex would be subject to those terms by 
accepting the Annex; however, this would make the Annex quite long.  We could 
also have them pop up within the site once the customer clicks on the type of 
product (e.g., west power) to indicate that any action in this product is 
subject to these specific terms (this would require that we also have them in 
our site documents so that they can be printed).

Once I have reviewed the updated FRS's for each of the sites, I will work to 
modify the Annex documents.

Please let me know if you should need anything else at this time.

Subject: Darwinian Kharma, Very weird  (A true story from Associated
Press,
by Kurt Westervelt)

Stick with this.....it's worth it!  This is the strangest thing I've ever
heard.  The series of events that had to have taken place in order for
this
to happen are astounding!  At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for
Forensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his
audience
with the legal complications of a bizarre death:  On March 23, 1994, the
medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he
died
from a shotgun wound to the head.  Mr. Opus had jumped from the top of a
ten-story building intending to commit suicide.  He left a note to that
effect indicating his despondency.  As he fell past the ninth floor his
life
was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window which killed
him
instantly.  Neither the shooter nor the dead man was aware that a safety
net
had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some
building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to
complete
his suicide the way he planned.  ""Ordinarily,"" Dr. Mills continued, ""A
person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds even though
the mechanism might not be what he intended"" is still defined as
committing
suicide.  That Mr. Opus was shot during what would apparently have been
an
unsuccessful suicide attempt because of the safety net, caused the
medical
examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands.  The room on the
ninth
floor where the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and
his wife.  They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with
a
shotgun.  The man was so upset when he pulled the trigger that he
completely
missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus
as
he passed by outside.  When someone, intending to kill person ""A,"" kills
person ""B"" instead; someone is still guilty of murder.  When confronted
with
a murder charge the old man and his wife were both adamant; they both
said
they thought the shotgun was unloaded.  The old man said it was his
long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun.  He
had
no intention to murder her.  Therefore, the killing of Mr. Opus appeared
to
be an accident; that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.  The
continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son
loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident.  It
transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and
the
son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun
threateningly,
loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his
mother.
The case now reverts back to one of murder on the part of the son.  Now
comes the final twist!  Further investigation revealed that the couple's
son
was in fact, Ronald Opus.  He had become increasingly despondent over his
failed attempt to engineer his mother's murder.  This led him to jump off
the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by the shotgun
blast
passing through the ninth floor window.  The son had actually murdered
himself so the medical examiner closed the case and declared it a
suicide.",Kharma Kurt Westervelt AAFS Don Harper Mills Ronald Opus Opus Mills,,"Associated

     Friday, October 19, 2001 Issue 39   EDITORIAL  Weathering Risk   This =
week's Briefing is concerned with risk, chiefly that presented by weather i=
n the face of newly deregulated (re-regulated?) energy markets.  Our main f=
eature explains how susceptible the industry has become to increasingly vol=
atile weather, and how the plethora of risks which become presented (includ=
e those directly related to earnings) can be alleviated by trading a portfo=
lio of weather derivatives.  We also outline some of the companies who are =
already emerging as major players in what is already becoming an essential =
tool for managing financial risk.   On a broader note, our second feature o=
utlines approaches to managing risk in general, and how energy companies ca=
n identify and consolidate new opportunities, and reap real financial benef=
it from minimal risk.   Also, this week saw Eyeforenergy's conference in Si=
ngapore, which has been a resounding success.  In a future issue of the Bri=
efing, we will bring you details of events as they unfolded at this three-d=
ay meeting of some of the most influential and forward-thinking companies a=
nd organizations in the Asian energy market.  For now, you can apply for un=

LEGISLATIVE STATUS REPORT

			 The following bills that may be of interest to our
members have been introduced in the Second Regular Session of New Mexico's
45th Legislature, which bills will be monitored during the Session, as I
will continue to watch for any other developments that might specifically
affect our industry:

			HB 165-Tribal Capital Improvements Tax Credit:
Introduced by Representative Ben Lujan, Dem., Dist. 46 (Santa Fe). Would
provide that one liable for the oil and gas severance tax, conservation tax
or emergency school tax on production from Indian tribal land will have a
credit each month equal to the lesser of the tax that is exclusively
dedicated to fund capital improvement projects on the tribal land (but not
commercial buildings) imposed on such production by the Indian tribe, or 2%
of the taxable value of such production. The burden of showing entitlement
to this credit would be on the taxpayer, who must furnish proof of payment
of the tribal tax. This bill received a ""Do Pass"" in the House Energy &
Natural Resources Committee and was sent to the House Taxation & Revenue
Committee, where a hearing will be held on Monday, February 4, at 1:30 PM.

			HB 230-""Indian Country"" Defined: Introduced by
Representative Leo C. Watchman, Jr., Dem., Dist. 9 (McKinley & San Juan).
Would broadly define ""Indian country"" under the New Mexico statutes. This
bill was referred to the House Rules & Order of Business Committee, where a
hearing will be held on Saturday, February 2, at 1:30 PM.

			HB 309-San Juan Oil and Gas Field Training Program:
Introduced by Representative Nick Tinnin, Rep., Dist. 1 (San Juan). Would
appropriate $300,000 to San Juan College for Fiscal Year 2003 and subsequent
years for an oil and gas field training program at the college that includes
certification and training for well, pipeline and drilling technicians and
field workers. This bill was referred to the House Business & Industry and
Appropriations & Finance Committees.

			HB 388-Tax Credit For Produced Water: Introduced by
Representative Robert W. Burpo, Rep., Dist. 23 (Bernalillo). Would provide
that a taxpayer who produces water from a depth of 3,000 feet or more below
the surface in the course of drilling for oil and gas may take an income tax
credit of $1,000 per acre-foot of produced water (not to exceed $400,000 per
year) if the taxpayer discharges the water into the Pecos River in
compliance with the New Mexico Water Quality Act, and subject to other
conditions. This bill was referred to the House Business & Industry and
Taxation & Revenue Committees.

			HB 423-Additional Natural Gas Pipeline Systems
Study: Introduced by Representative Donald L Whitaker, Dem., Dist. 61 (Lea).
This bill is identical to SB 369 and was referred to the House Energy &
Natural Resources and Appropriations & Finance Committees. 

			SB  16-Lea and Carlsbad Conservation District Study:
Introduced by Senator Carroll H. Leavell, Rep., Dist. 41 (Eddy & Lea). Would
appropriate $500,000 to New Mexico State University for Fiscal Year 2003 for
a study by the Lea and Carlsbad Soil and Water Conservation Districts of
issues related to the use of water produced by oil and gas exploration from
""deep underground."" This bill was found germane by the Senate Committees'
Committee , received a ""Do Pass"" in the Senate Conservation Committee, and
was sent to the Senate Finance Committee,  where it was temporarily tabled.

			SB 283-Tribal Capital Improvements Tax Credit:
Introduced by Senator Leonard Tsosie, Dem., Dist 37 (Dona Ana, Otero &
Sierra). This bill is identical to HB 165, was found germane by the Senate
Committees' Committee, and was sent to the Senate Indian & Cultural Affairs,
Conservation and Finance Committees.

			SB 345-Well Workover Projects: Introduced by Senator
Leonard Lee Rawson, Rep., Dist. 37 (Dona Ana, Otero & Sierra). Would amend
the Natural Gas and Crude Oil Production Incentive Act to expand the
definition of ""well workover project"" to include the installation by the
operator of workover equipment that is intended to substantially increase
the life of the well and that has been approved and certified by the OCD,
which approval shall be granted if the OCD determines that the equipment
will substantially reduce operating costs, thereby increasing the life of
the well and its recoverable reserves. This bill was found germane by the
Senate Committees' Committee and sent to the Senate Conservation and Finance
Committees.

			SB 369-Additional Natural Gas Pipeline Systems
Study: Also introduced by Senator Leavell. Would require the Legislative
Council to assign an Interim Committee to study the economic feasibility and
the costs and benefits of financing, constructing and operating a natural
gas pipeline to transport New Mexico natural gas to additional markets. This
bill was found germane by the Senate Committees' Committee and sent to the
Senate Conservation and Finance Committee. 

			HJM 17-Coordinated Oil & Gas Permitting Process:
Introduced by Representative Patricia A. Lundstrom, Dem., Dist. 5
(McKinley). Would request that the Department of Environment, the Oil
Conservation Division and the federal Bureau of Land Management cooperate in
the development of a coordinated permit process for oil and gas activities.
This bill received a ""Do Pass"" in the House Energy & Natural Resources
Committee and was sent to the House Business & Industry Committee.

			I will continue to keep you posted concerning any
changes or additional issues.

nation's biggest electric market combine to form the most
attractive market in the US. And the retailers are
stampeding into the state.

Two months after the market opens, the 'What's working,
what's not, and why', will be addressed in a lively,
interactive forum, led by industry leaders including:

- Hon. David Sibley, Former Senator, Texas Legislature
- Nick Fulford, Senior Vice President, Centrica
- Alan Raymond, Former President, Shell Energy Services
- Thomas Noel, CEO, Electric Reliability Council of Texas
- Jim Ajello, President, Reliant Energy Solutions

The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Mar. 14
Beginning today through 3/19, the Corporate Security team will replace the GRC.dat file in W:\scripts\UpdateGRC and W:\scripts\logon\Win2000\original to point NAV clients on nahou-apnav01 to nahou-apnav02 (only about 650 left).  No impact is expected.

Mar. 15
From 11:00 - 11:15 a.m., the Corporate Security group will remove the svceu_SAPConnect account from CORP Domain Admins group.  No impact is expected.

Mar. 15
From 4:00 - 6:00 p.m.., the Unix Team will upgrade the Time server.  Timex.ect.enron.com which is now on a Unix desktop network will be moved to a production network and to Netra T1 hardware. It would be doing the same activity as Rolex which was replaced on Monday. All clients are now pointing to new Rolex server & Timex.  No impact is expected.  

Mar. 15
From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will replace the switch on the Extranet link HOPIX1.  This change will cause intermittent outages for those external companies using this link to access the Enron Network.

Mar. 15
From 8:00 p.m. through 3/17 at 6:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will re-enable the File Replication Service on all Corporate domain controllers.  This change is necessary to replicate security policies.   FRS will be started on Corp DCs one at a time, watching to be sure replication completes.  Brief outages of Corp.enron.com security policies and possibly Exchange may occur.  The Messaging team will be notified if replication causes problems.  Support staff whose applications experience problems due to FRS should contact the solution center at ext. 54745.
Mar. 15
From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Corporate Server team will place Nahou-appr1 into the Corp Domain.  This change will affect applications using the R drive.

It is also possible that messages sent from he Blackberry may be returned.  Returned messages can be resent after the maintenance is complete.
Mar. 18
From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will change the DHCP scopes to update the secondary WINS and DNS entries.  This change will affect workstations that get their IP addresses via DHCP.  All scopes are renewed on a 24-hour basis so all changes should be completed by 3/19.  No impact is expected.
May 1
At 5:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will remove access to CORPHOU-DC07 (172.23.226.23, primary/secondary DNS) and NAHOU-NSWN03 (172.23.226.24, primary/secondary WINS) from devices within ECN.   All servers/workstations/equipment using these for WINS/DNS must have their settings changed. Use 172.16.7.120 for DNS and 172.16.7.116 for WINS in their place by this 5/01.
