8,"The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

ire via COMTEX/ -- American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) today reported thir=
d quarter net income of $298 million, down 60 percent from $737 million in =
the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p=
ercent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio=
n, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on e=
quity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively aff=
ected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge=
 of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the =
September 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in c=
ertain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisio=
ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i=
nsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination =
of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after=
-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since=
 September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl=
y, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost=
 of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th=
e company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery =
expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra =
operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat=
ed. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses=
 will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge inc=
ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a=
sset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor=
ganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i=
n certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio=
ns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr=
ocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec=
ted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por=
tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=
f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=
ted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=
ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress=
 on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=
r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =
  Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=
time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =
19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce=
nt. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   ""While we w=
ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=
rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =
we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=
estment activity slowed after September 11th,"" said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch=
airman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. ""In light of =
the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower=
 our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in=
itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business=
es with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be=
nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=
hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in=
 the economy.""   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=
e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a=
 year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127=
 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include=
d in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=
e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=
tacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income =
would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=
ear.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=
ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =
28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=
ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=
e September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=
r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=
et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=
arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=
lds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=
uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=
.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =
higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=
ncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=
in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating=
 expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=
ss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=
ing and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results ""=
on a managed basis"" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=
ich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=
lts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=
rmats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of=
 $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=
illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=
se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and=
 therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   Americ=
an Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 =
million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago.=
 Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $=
62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note=
d earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim=
s directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net inc=
ome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA re=
sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on =
the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly =
lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man=
agement and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, exclud=
ing the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due=
 primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-=
control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the=
 company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit=
ies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct=
ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo=
lio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) repo=
rted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i=
ncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax=
 ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi=
ng these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximate=
ly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB s=
ustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks=
, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co=
sts did not impact AEB's quarterly results.   AEB's business results reflec=

sults also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses =
as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi=

HAPPY HOLIDAYS! (AND WHERE TO GET HELP IN A PINCH)

    The week between Christmas and New Year's
         is traditionally vacation time in Silicon
         Valley, so we're taking the week off, too.
         In the meantime, here are some places you can
         get computer help over the holidays. And if
         you really, really miss me, I've also linked
         to my most popular columns of 2001.

    HO, HO, HO! WHY CHRISTMAS 2002 WILL BE JOLLY, BY GOLLY

    While this is a muted Christmas for most
    of us, it's been a merry one indeed for
    e-tailers. Pat thinks that if this holiday
    generated so much holiday cheer, just
    wait 'til next year. That's when some
    enabling technologies will make online
    shopping far more than the glorified
    catalog-buying experience it is now.

  WHY YOU'RE STILL NOT GIVING CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY WANT

   The Internet promised to make ""mass customization""
         a reality. But so far it hasn't worked out that
         well. Reason: It's simply too costly. But
         is there some way your business can create
         tailor-made goods for even broad markets?
         Adrian thinks so--but it's going to be tricky.

  BUILDING AN E-GOVERNMENT: IT'LL BE HARD, BUT IT'LL HELP IT

   Will the government ever go paperless? It
         looks like in 2002 it might start. Such an undertaking
         would boost government spending and give
         tech businesses a much-needed shot in the
         arm. But it won't be easy. Larry explains why
         it'll be so challenging to bring the government
         into the wired world.

Since the three nuclear units have gone down there has been a significant increase in imports into California from the northwest which coincides with increased hydro output.  This has continued to suppress Socal gas sendouts.    Grand Coulee outflows on Monday and Tuesday have exceeded inflows.  Monday: In-69.8, Out-73.4; Tuesday: In-57.7, Out 68.2.  The elevation is starting to creep lower.

Can you help us with these questions?  Will this drafting to continue?  What is the elevation target for the end of the month?  Why did yesterday's inflow decline so much?

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

44,"Dave:
A couple of issues:

1.  We continue to have a number of transactions that fail because of credit 
exposure.  These are companies that have excellent credit, such as Duke, 
Dynegy, Equitable, Mieco, etc, but have a fixed credit line on EOL that they 
blow through periodically.  They get a failed trade and it often takes 5-10 
minutes to rectify the problem, at which time we've lost the trade.   We need 
the major counterparties to have unlimited credit on EOL, just as they have 
in normal trading.

2.  As a corrallary, I am under the impression that when a trade fails 
because of credit, the counterparty does not get an explanatory error message 
describing what happened and what to do.  When a credit failure happens, the 
counterparty will often keep clicking on the same product, getting the same 
error message"

Hawk vote for California firm unanimous 
Montgomery Watson pegged for water plant 
By MARY FLOOD 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The Houston Area Water Corp. voted unanimously Monday to grant a $92 million 
contract to a California-based firm to design, build and operate a Lake 
Houston water plant. 
City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The 
administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery 
Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron 
Corp. 
The water corporation, known as ""the Hawk,"" voted 5-0 to grant the contract. 
If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years 
to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. 
It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 
million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. 
The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, 
and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. 
The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 
when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to 
construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant 
expansion for $32 million. 
But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. 
The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a 
short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds 
itself. 
The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay 
the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant 
eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This 
plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could 
cost about $2 billion to implement. 
City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure 
committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would 
focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three 
recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. 
Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and 
that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee 
this contract. 
The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. ""In 
my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who 
will do it,"" Robinson said. 
The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been 
heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. 
Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new 
pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating 
Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council 
members to switch the contract to it. 
Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten 
work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the 
Hawk procedures as well. 
John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the 
first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman 
David Berg complaining of the ""deleterious economic effect"" on Azurix of the 
board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg 
answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the 
job. Berg didn't do so. 
Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of 
Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply 
indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. 
Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. 


		

		
		
		
		INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project 
Financial Times; May 15, 2001
By ROBIN ALLEN

		There are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or 
sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export 
scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. 
		Enron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is 
reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in 
which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. 
		However, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of 
""selling"" at least part of its shareholding. 
		The threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit 
from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. 
		The project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the 
United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu 
Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic 
political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a 
large-scale project, especially in the early stages. 
		Dolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu 
Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer 
on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to 
exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific 
North Field to Abu Dhabi. 
		Qatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron
's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to 
construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. 
		Enron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but 
one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas 
accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on. Sheikh Zayed Bin 
Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, disapproves of commodity trading. 
		""If the Qatar-UAE gas deal was going to be profitable"" for western energy 
majors, asked one senior western diplomat, ""then why are the serious US 
energy majors not involved?"" For more reports see www.ft.com/globaleconomy

JAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp 
said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 
billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of 
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
""If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD 
average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per 
year,"" Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.
Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that 
indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy 
resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. 
But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high 
electricity rates. 
A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's 
electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) 
compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. 
Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high 
electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the 
international market. 
Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and 
California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating 
its market in 1998. 
These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue 
permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. 
""The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California,"" 
Kean said. 
North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its 
first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. 
In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. 
Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process 
he said held many benefits. 
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last 
year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The 
measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended 
Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. 
However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants 
and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The 
Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.

Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus

05/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector 
deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down 
the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts 
said at an industry seminar Tuesday. 
The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long 
enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and 
performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail 
power market in March 2000.
However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of 
potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to 
conventional power companies. 
""What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization 
in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable 
power supply significantly,"" said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the 
University of Tokyo. 
Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as 
much for households and three times higher for industrial users. 
""There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly 
implement the liberalization,"" Hatta said. 
He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power 
companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered 
once the prices are liberalized. ""If power rates are set higher during those 
peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using 
electricity."" 
Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. 
(ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward 
trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. 
He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power 
prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development countries following the liberalization. 
Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called ""Reassessing Power 
Deregulation,"" which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. 

Hatta of the University of Tokyo said ""it's very wise"" that Japan has begun 
the deregulation with the ""bilateral supply, or trade"" system under which 
suppliers and users clinch deals directly. 
Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial 
and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - 
is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial 
deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. 
Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and 
derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power 
providers, Hatta said. 
Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation 
should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates 
- regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs 
are levied on prices. 
""There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices"" nationwide, 
Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees 
transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. 
Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) 
management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. 
Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power 
Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its 
power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with ""strong back-up"" from the 
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. 
""Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with 
power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select 
independent power providers,"" Omuro said. 
"

$4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next 
sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with 
williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of 
the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common 
here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe 
in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some 
shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were 
trying to break $5."

	1. Do customers even know the info is available or useful?
	2. Is the info publicly available?
	3. Is the info easily obtainable?

	In this case, the answer is yes to all three, so I don't care.  If the answer is no to one or more of the above, a judgment call has to be made.

70,"Hey,
Surprised to hear from you.  jeff is in charge of nat gas operations and reports to sally beck who is in charge of all back office ops.  as of this morn, he is still here.   i've heard some wacky enron rumors before but this one is pretty good.  where'd you hear this?

 "
71,"Hey:
1.  Theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ICE after hours when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote.  This is a prearranged trade and is illegal on Nymex, but it is my understanding it will be legal on ICE assuming ICE uses the IPE clearing platform, where prearranged trading is legal.   Agree about liquidity.  I dont think this really helps ICE's volumes, nor liquidity.  Funds want liquidity so they will not flock to ICE in the current state.  
2.  My guess is not intercommodity, but maybe intracommodity.  For instance, a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the 2 trades additive.  

Important Note: ICE is our competition and I am very,very wary to support their system, unless absolutely necessary.

90,"Bob,
Wanted to say hello. My trip to Ireland and England
was a blast. Had a good time in both countries. A lot
of history blah, blah, blah. Been with the first
Marines for about two weeks and I am beginning to
figure my way around. Working out every day and
running (on my own) a great deal. Do not want to be
the wimp of the bunch. Should be fun two years with a
lot of training which will culminate with a deployment
to WestPac next year sometime and thats it.

Otherwise thing are good for me. I will be heading bck
to NY for the third week in Sept to attend a wedding
of my HS friend Gary. You probably remember him. Will
be home for a week. First time since I left Med
school. Taking my girlfriend with me back home. She
has already met the Rat in Vegas. She also met Gary
and his bride to be when they came out here for  a
week in the winter.

Hope all is well with you. Any little Bobs in the
future? Stay in touch and I hope the Yankees can hold
on and the Knicks finally unload the old man. Now,
there is no way they can compete with Miami.

Later,
Fran

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Chris Warren , RB PHI - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 Warren arrived in Philadelphia on Friday, and practiced with the Eagles on 
Saturday. Although he hasn't had a lot of time to get familiar with the 
offensive scheme, he could get some action against Cleveland on Sunday. We 
wouldn't recommend starting him during the Fantasy playoffs this week, 
however.  

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 Although Watters didn't practice all week because of a bad case of turf toe, 
Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said he will start Sunday against Denver. Watters 
is not on the injury report and medical reports say the toe is fine.  

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.

ROCKETS GUARD TO SHARE BACKCOURT WITH BRYANT 

  <http://origin.nba.com/media/allstar2002/francis_drive_020125.jpg>Jan. 26 - Houston Rockets guard Steve Francis today was named as a starter for the Western Conference in the 2002 NBA All-Star Game to be played in Philadelphia on February 10. 

Francis will join Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant in the backcourt along with Tim Duncan of the Spurs, L.A.'s Shaquille O'Neal and Kevin Garnett of the Timberwolves in the Western Conference frontcourt.

The Rockets point guard, who will be making his inaugural All-Star appearance, held the second position among Western Conference guards when the first returns of the 2002 All-Star balloting were announced last month. He maintained that position throughout the process, easily outdistancing Seattle's Gary Payton for the starting nod.

120,"SIPPING VODKA
A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly
speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous
on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water
glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning
of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He
proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he
found the following note on the door:

1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not
referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.
8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he
said,""Take this and eat it for it is my body.""  He did not
say, Eat me""
12.  The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,""
13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub
thanks for the grub, yeah God.
14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at
St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.


The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings
good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the
chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.
Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You
will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain
is not broken.

""I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is to try to
please everyone...""
- Bill Cosby...

123,look at sheet 2
124,"I've reviewed the rules and brackets.... 

 extra pts.   1  from 3 yd line,,  2pts from 10 yrd line

Games are 2, 20 minute halves with a 7 play rule at the end of the 20 
minutes... 7 plays occur after the 20 minutes...


the Enron teams play first at  10 am  and then we have a 1 hour break...

the AC teams play at 11 and then play again at 12 against us..

so the AC teams will be tired.   

The next game follows at 1 pm, the game against the Enron aggies (most 
likely) for the tickets.

===

As soon as we get into the lead on the first game and cover whatever bets we 
make with Webb  (a 17 pt lead in the first half ends the game)..   the top 
players should take a break  (eric, paul, and stephen, alternatively should 
take a break on offense, and Luis should sit  out on defense)

This is especially important for the game against AC, which should be an 
easier game.   As soon as we get a 1 to 2 touchdown lead, the top players 
should rest.

Last year our team was pretty tired going into the final game and with good 
time management we can lower our chances of key injuries and tired players..

==

Eric if you have time,  throw some more plays together... perhaps some more 
option,  pick off pass routes, reverses,  pitches to a back who passes to the 
QB, etc...  indicate what the line/center should do for these run plays...

finally, Saturday morning lets take 5-10 minutes to go over defensive 
assignments and go over how zone works... and who is responsible for what.. 
so that we're all on the same page."

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  ""We'll see Wednesday or Thursday,"" said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, ""but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play.""    

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.     

 Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 The status of the Jets' running back for this week's game against the Bears 
is still uncertain.  Martin left Sunday's game in Miami with what was 
described as a strained back, and never returned to the field.  He had an 
examination by team doctors yesterday, and had some X-rays taken as well.  
The club hasn't released any information on the resluts of the exam.  If 
Martin is on your Fantasy squad, your best bet is to stay tuned as the week 
progresses.     

 Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 According to New York Newsday , Coles will be unable to play in this week's 
game against the Bears.  He was hit on the knee during the opening kickoff of 
the second half in Sunday's win over the Dolphins.  If Coles is an integral 
part of your roster, look to pick up Dedric Ward, who should get more playing 
time in Coles' absence.    

 Billy Joe Tolliver , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints re-signed Tolliver yesterday, after the 10-year veteran had been 
cut by the team during training camp. With Jeff Blake out for the season, New 
Orleans needed a No. 3 quarterback, so Tolliver will fill that role behind 
starter Aaron Brooks and backup Jake Delhomme.  

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints placed Blake on injured reserve yesterday, officially ending his 
season. He will have surgery on his fractured and dislocated right foot as 
soon as the swelling subsides and the extent of the damage is determined. 
Blake will be replaced by Aaron Brooks.  

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith's status is still not certain, but he does expect to return for 
Sunday's game against the Colts.  He left last week's game against the Jets 
after aggravating his strained right hamstring, an injury which he sustained 
a week earlier against the Chargers.  Smith has been one of the year's 
biggest Fantasy sleepers, and has become an everyday starter for those 
Fantasy owners who were lucky enough to grab him.  If he does in fact play 
this week, be sure to include him in your starting lineup.    

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Although his status is still up in the air, Fiedler expects that he will be 
ready to play in Sunday's AFC showdown against the Colts.  Fiedler was 
injured on the first play of the Jets' game when linebacker Mo Lewis drove 
his head and shoulder into the turf. He suffered a slightly seperated 
throwing shoulder and developed muscle spasms in his back.  Fielder isn't one 
of the better options in the Fantasy game, so avoid playing him this week 
even if he does start.  

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/21/00 
 The Redskins should know by Thursday if Johnson can re-assume his starting 
job for this week's showdown against the Eagles.  He has started to test his 
injured left knee with some light dropbacks and will likely push the knee 
harder during practice on Wednesday and Thursday.    

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With the injury to Ike Hilliard, Jurevicius will likely start this week's 
game at Arizona.  With only 12 receptions on the entire season, Jurevicius 
isn't a solid Fantasy option, so don't pick him up unless your roster is 
really straped for receivers.    

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Antoine Winfield has been lost for the rest of the season with a 
torn labrum in his right shoulder.  He suffered the injury three weeks ago 
against New England. Winfield has tried to play through the pain, but has 
aggravated the injury in each of Buffalo's last two games.  Head Coach Wade 
Phillips announced to the media that Winfield will have surgery on 
Wednesday.  His loss will hurt Buffalo's secondary, but they remain a solid 
defense in the world of Fantasy.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Huard the starter for this week's game 
against the Broncos.  Huard took all of the snaps with the first team offense 
after a bye week, and is ready to make his first start since sustaining a 
concussion on Oct. 22 in Oakland.  Huard isn't considered a solid Fantasy 
option, so don't start him until he shows some signs that he is ready to 
produce.    

 Cardinals , DT ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Arizona defense came out of Sunday's loss to the Eagles extremely banged 
up.  Linebacker Zach Walz, who just recently returned from knee surgery, is 
out with a broken left leg.  Defensive tackle Mark Smith hurt his shoulder 
and had his arm in a sling on Monday.  Safety Kwamie Lassiter was also 
injured in the game, suffering a sprained knee. With all of these injuries on 
defense, it's probably a good idea to keep the Cardinals' defense on the 
bench this week.      

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/20/00 
 Alstott probably will miss the rest of the regular season after spraining 
his left knee in Tampa Bay's 13-10 loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday.  The 
Bucs described Alstott's injury as a third-degree sprain of the medial 
collateral ligament and said he is expected to be sidelined six to eight 
weeks.  Charles Kirby, a third-year pro in his first season with Tampa Bay, 
will replace Alstott.     

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Meximullets Updated 11/20/00 
 Toomer posted a great day for his Fantasy owners against Detroit, catching 
eight passes for 108 yards in the Giants' 31-21 loss. He may have a more 
difficult time next week against Arizona's All-Pro cornerback Aeneas 
Williams, so start him at your own discretion.      

 Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Barber caught eight passes and compiled 129 yards of total offense in 
Sunday's loss to the Lions.  Look for Barber to get a number of looks out of 
the backfield this week against Arizona, as the Giants attempt to compensate 
for the loss of wide receiver Ike Hilliard.   

 Kerry Collins , QB NYG - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Collins threw a season-high 51 passes on Sunday, but it wasn't enough to 
tame the Lions.  Collins has been a more productive Fantasy option of late, 
throwing eight touchdown passes in his last three games. He may run into a 
road block this week against the Cardinals, however, especially if Ike 
Hilliard is unable to play.  Without Hilliard, Arizona can put All-Pro 
cornerback Aeneas Williams on Amani Toomer, leaving Tiki Barber and Pete 
Mitchell as Collins' only real receiving options. If you can find a better 
quarterback than Collins this week, it might be a good idea to use 
him.           

 James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 11/20/00 
 McKnight caught four passes for 50 yards in Sunday's loss at Baltimore.  He 
could, however, be a good sleeper pick this week against the Vikings.  
Minnesota's secondary can be beaten downfield, so look for McKnight to try 
and break a few long ones in an effort to spark a banged up Dallas offense.   
 

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Ramiro Updated 11/20/00 
 Smith had his second consecutive subpar performance on Sunday against the 
Ravens, rushing for only 48 yards on eleven carries. He has been held to only 
64 yards rushing in the past two weeks, which is significant when you 
consider that Smith is one of the league's greatest running backs of 
all-time.  The combination of a short week and the loss of center Mark 
Stepnoski will hurt Smith's production, so it might be a good idea to sit him 
this week if your roster allows it.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Aikman found out just how good the Ravens' defense is on Sunday.  He 
completed just 19-of-33 passes for 138 yards and three interceptions in 
Dallas' 27-0 loss in Baltimore. Aikman faces a Minnesota defense on 
Thanksgiving that has been solid in recent weeks, so don't expect any kind of 
Fantasy explosion from the Cowboys' aging quarterback.      

 Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/20/00 
 Hilliard, who left Sunday's game against the Lions with a bruised sternum 
and lung, will remain in the hospital for the next two days and will likely 
miss this Sunday's game against Arizona. Look for Joe Jurevicius to start in 
Hilliard's place, but don't expect him to produce the same type of numbers 
that Hilliard has posted.     

 Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/00 
 Anderson ran 17 times for 76 yards against the 49ers Sunday.  Although he 
has become more confident in putting weight on his bad knee, you probably 
won't see Anderson have a big game until next season.  Don't expect things to 
get any better for Anderson next week when he goes up against a tough Raiders 
run defense.     

 Johnnie Morton , WR DET - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/00 
 Morton awakened from his slumber to catch six passes for  78 yards against 
the Giants Sunday.  He only had one catch in each of the Lions last three 
games.  Morton will probably struggle once again this Thursday when the Lions 
face a formidable Patriots secondary.     

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 11/20/00 
 While completing 23-of-36 passes, Favre threw for 301  yards with two 
touchdowns and one interception.  He showed extreme toughness Sunday, 
starting the game despite suffering a sprained foot a week earlier.  He 
should be just as effective next week against a docile Panthers pass rush.  
Carolina won't put too much pressure on Favre, allowing him to dissect the 
secondary, and pile up Fantasy points.     

 Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Meximullets Updated 11/20/00 
 The Packers' wideout had what might have been his best game of the season 
against the Colts Sunday, racking up 155 yards on eight catches.  He won't 
continue to post numbers like this, but look for Schroeder to have some 
success against the Panthers this Sunday.     

 Ahman Green , RB GB - Ramiro Updated 11/20/00 
 Green ran for a career-high 153 yards on 24 carries Sunday against the 
Colts.  His success should continue in upcomings games against the weak run 
defenses of the Panthers, Bears, and Lions.   

 Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 In relief of Blake, the little-used Brooks completed 14-of-22 passes for 187 
yards, with two touchdowns and one  interception.  Owners of Jeff Blake may 
want to consider picking up Brooks.  It will take some time for Brooks to get 
used to playing in the NFL, but he could put up solid numbers in the final 
games of the season as the Saints face a plethora of weak pass defenses.

 Latest NBA Player News 

 Jake Voskuhl , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Voskuhl was placed on the injured list by Chicago with a right hip flexor 
strain today. One of the Bulls second-round picks in the June draft, Voskuhl 
was averaging 1.3 points and 1.5 rebounds in four games this season.  

 Dalibor Bagaric , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Bulls today activated Bagaric, the 24th pick overall in the June draft. 
He had missed Chicago's first 10 games with a bruised right knee. Bagaric 
averaged 18.3 points and 10.4 rebounds for Benston Zagreb of the Croatian 
League last year.  

 Randy Livingston , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Warriors waived Livingston today, less than one week after signing him 
as a free agent. He had appeared in only two games and was expendable with 
the return of Bob Sura from injury.  

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Warriors activated Sura from the injured list today. He had been 
sidelined all season with a lower back injury suffered during training camp. 
The 27-year-old was acquired in June from Cleveland via Milwaukee in a 
three-team deal, after he had posted a career-high 13.8 point-per-game 
average with the Cavaliers.  

 Bruno Sundov , C IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Pacers activated Sundov from the injured list after placing Tyus Edney 
on the same list today. The 20-year-old center had been sidelined all season 
with a sprained left ankle.  

 Tyus Edney , G IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Pacers placed Edney on the injured list today with plantar fasciatis in 
his left foot. The 5-10, 152-pound center will miss a minimum of five games. 
He was averaging 3.4 points and 1.9 assists in eight games this season.  

 Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Thorpe received a cortisone shot in his ailing left foot, and he will be 
sidelined another four weeks. He was placed on the injured list on Thursday 
after averaging 3.0 points and 1.7 rebounds in six games.  

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/21/00 
 Camby had an MRI during Sunday's game which confirmed that he only has a 
sprained ankle.  He turned the ankle in Friday night's win over Phoenix.  He 
is listed as day to day, and it is unclear whether he will begin playing 
tonight or tomorrow. Camby has been the best center in the Eastern Confernece 
thus far, so make sure to start him as soon as he returns to the lineup.    

 Terrell Brandon , G MIN - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 Brandon, who has missed four games with an ankle sprain, practiced for the 
first time on Monday since being hurt on Nov. 9.  He said he might return to 
the lineup when the Timberwolves host the Vancouver Grizzlies on Wednesday 
night.     

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 After initially expecting a return to the court tonight against Cleveland, 
it seems that Jones will miss at least tonight's game - and likely more. ""The 
doctor told me flat out,"" Jones said, ""it's going to be awhile.""  Jones tried 
to participate in drills yesterday, but his injured calf continued to tighten 
on him.  If Jones is on your roster, it's a good idea to keep him on the 
bench until his prognosis is a bit more clear.    

 Dirk Nowitzki , F DAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/21/00 
 Nowitzki re-aggravated a left shoulder injury in the third quarter of Monday 
night's game against the Jazz.  He left the game and did not return, but did 
post 20 points and 14 rebounds before exiting.  He is not expected to miss 
any time because of the injury.  Nowitzki is establishing himself as a real 
Fantasy star, so continue to start him as long as his shoulder holds up.    

 Rex Chapman , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Chapman announced his retirement Monday because of a series of injuries.  He 
underwent surgery on his right wrist before training camp and began the 
season on the injured list.  Chapman is also scheduled to have ankle surgery 
soon.     

 Todd Day , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Day was activated from the injured list Friday.  Guard Sam Jacobsen was 
placed on the list to make room for Day.  Day was a key reserve for the Suns 
in 1999-2000 but was sidelined for the first few weeks this season due to a 
knee injury.  He will be a valuable reserve for the T'Wolves as well but 
won't help a Fantasy team too much.     

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Skinner was placed on the injured list after hurting his ankle.  Zendon 
Hamilton was activated to replace Skinner on the roster.  Skinner has been 
somewhat of a disappointment this season averaging 5.8 points and 4.7 
rebounds per game.     

 Jeff McInnis , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 McInnis is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nets after 
suffering a bruised knee against the Sonics Saturday.  Rookie Keyon Dooling 
is expected to get his first start at point guard for the Clippers.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Williams played 26 minutes in Saturday's game against the Suns, scoring four 
points and grabbing seven rebounds.  He had missed Thursday's game against 
the Hornets because of a hip and groin injuries.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Del Negro played eight minutes in Sunday's loss to the Knicks.  He had 
missed the Warriors previous two games due to a sprained ankle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Buckner re-injured his right foot and is expected to be sidelined for at 
least a week.  Hubert Davis is expected to start at shooting guard in his 
absence.    

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Dickerson is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nuggets due 
to a sprained ankle.  Look for veteran Kevin Edwards to start at shooting 
guard in his place.    

 Doug West , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 West's strained right shoulder has healed and head coach Sidney Lowe is 
expected to activate him from the injured list this week.  Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 
is expected to be placed on the injured list to make room for West.  

 Shareef Abdur-Rahim , F VAN - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/20/00 
 Abdur-Rahim is expected to play in Monday's game against Vancouver.  He 
missed Saturday's game to be with his sick mother in Atlanta.  If he doesn't 
make it back to Vancouver in time rookie Stromile Swift could get a rare 
start at small forward.    

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 MacCulloch was placed on the injured list Monday with an ankle injury.  With 
the return of Matt Geiger, MacCulloch's already low Fantasy value diminishes 
even further.     

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/20/00 
 Geiger has been activated off the injured list, and could see some playing 
time in tonight's game in Boston.  With Geiger's return, the Sixers placed 
center Todd McCulloch on the injured list.  If you have Geiger on your 
Fantasy roster, give him some time to get back into game shape before putting 
him in your starting lineup.    

 Tim Thomas , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Thomas disclosed on Saturday that he is having some real discomfort in his 
left knee, and it is getting worse with each game that he plays. Thomas has 
started off slow, but didn't want to use the injury as an excuse.  ""It's very 
painful at times,"" said Thomas. ""The only thing I can do is keep getting rest 
as much as possible.""  The Bucks can ill-afford to lose Thomas; they have 
already lost starting forward Darvin Ham and backup forward Scott Williams 
this season.  If Thomas is on your Fantasy squad, it might be a good idea to 
keep in on the bench until his condition improves.      

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Jones has missed three straight games with a right calf sprain, but says 
that he expects to play on Wednesday night against Cleveland. Jones has 
averaged 16.9 points through his first seven games in Miami.     

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/20/00 
 Rose his hoping to make his season debut on Tuesday night against the 
Rockets, but he's not making any promises.  He was suppose to return to 
action last week, but the team's medical personnel advised him to wait a bit 
longer before hitting the court.  If Rose is on your roster, give him at 
least another week before putting him into your starting lineup.    

 Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 The Detroit Pistons announced on Monday morning that they had come to terms 
with Smith, on what is believed to be a one-year deal for the NBA's mid-level 
exception of $2.25 million (pro-rated after 11 games).  Smith had reportedly  
agreed to re-sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum 
of $611,000 last week.  He will eventually be the Pistons starting center but 
will probably spend the next few weeks inmproving his conditioning.  There is 
no need to rush and try to acquire Smith.  He has been a solid reserve 
at-best throughout his career.  If you have him on your Fantasy team wait 
awhile before you insert him into your lineup.     

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/20/00 
 Camby turned his ankle during Friday night's victory in Phoenix. X-rays 
taken on his ankle were negative, then Camby underwent an MRI as a 
precautionary measure. He missed Sunday night's game against the Warriors, 
and is listed as day to day.       

 Tim Hardaway , G MIA - The Old School Fools Updated 11/19/00 
 Hardaway, plagued by knee ailments for the past two seasons, sat out 
Saturday night's game against the Portland Trail Blazers with tendinitis in

 League City to start hearings on center

            By: JENNIFER THOMAS, Citizen Staff December 26, 2001

      Three public hearings have been scheduled to discuss the League City
Community Center referendum that's up for voter approval in a special
election on Feb. 2.

      Voters will be asked to approve a $12.8 million community center,
equipped with an indoor competitive pool, outdoor recreational pool, weight
room, gymnasium and other amenities.
      Ian Powell of SHW Group, Inc., the architectural engineering firm
designing the facility, will be conducting the hearings, along with
representatives from the League City Parks Department.
      The first hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, Jan. 2, at the Clear
Creek High School Ninth Grade Center, located at 2451 E. Main St., at 6:30
p.m.
      The second hearing will be Thursday, Jan. 10 at Creekside Intermediate
School, 4320 E. Main St., at 6:30 p.m.
      The last hearing will be held at the Johnny Arolfo Civic Center,
located on Walker, just next to City Hall, Tuesday, Jan. 29, at 6 p.m.
      The community center is the second phase of a project that started with
the construction of the Sportsplex.
      Two sites are under consideration for the proposed community center;
the land across from City Hall, and Walter Hall Park off FM 270.
      Funding for construction of the community center will come from the 1/4
cent sales tax that was passed to help pay for the construction of the
Sportsplex, from Certificates of Obligation, and from the city's General
Fund.
      Membership fees, user fees, and rental costs will pay for operations
and maintenance.

Questions abound about community center

By Alicia Gooden
The Daily News

Published January 04, 2002

If the public's overall impression of the first public hearing on a proposed
community center is indicative of the February vote, the measure might face
an uphill battle.

""I think it lacked sufficient information to have a good, reasonable vote on
the issue,"" said J.A. Willhern, a League City resident.

A good portion of the small, vocal group that showed up Thursday night for
the hearing sent an overt message to city leaders - too many questions, not
enough answers.

From the onset of the meeting, Mayor Tommy Frankovich asked that the hearing
be one that set aside personal and political stances on the $12.8 million
project. By the end of the hearing, it was evident that the Feb. 2 election
would come down to which wheel squeaked the loudest.

Most of the comments made during the 90-minute hearing dealt with how the
project would be funded, who would use the facilities, where the community
center would be built and how much financial burden League City residents
would be asked to shoulder.

Residents like Fred Lawrence, Karl Silverman and Elaine Kosty hurled
questions at City Administrator Nick Finan and project consultant Ian Powell
about the specifics of the project. The questions probed how realistic the
city's estimation was that the yearly maintenance costs for the 64,000
square-foot center would cost just $825,000.

The total estimated cost of the project is $12.8 million. Of that amount,
$9.4 million in certificate of obligation would have to be sold. Other
funding sources would come from property taxes, 4B sales taxes and any grants
the city could secure.

Also asked of city leaders was how much more out-of-area swim teams would be
charged as compared to those aquatic teams inside the city and how much the
listed additions such as a child care center and second gymnasium would cost.
A shared concern among many who do not support the project or are undecided
is that the center is really for the swim teams, many of which are outside of
League City and Galveston County.

Throughout the questioning, however, Finan and other city officials remained
poised.

Yet, some of the queries posed stumped city officials. Those in attendance
wanted to know how much of the $825,000 included salaries and benefits for
the staff needed to run the community center and how many people would be on
staff.

Though city officials said they had the information, it was not available at
the meeting, a point that many commented on afterward.

""How can you have a public hearing and not have the information the public
wants?"" asked resident Jeff Mallios.

But the criticisms and negative intonations were buoyed somewhat by Teresa
Toungate, a parent with the swim team League City Barracudas.

Toungate, to applause from park board members and those in support of the
project, told the crowd that the community center would bring an influx of
economic development to the city.

""There are more than 1,000 families that come to these competitions
sometimes,"" she said. ""These families are going to eat at our McDonald's,
Esteban's (a local restaurant) and spend money at our little stores.""

One of those expressing concern over the cost of the project said that League
City had no major retailers, only ""little stores"" to help offset the cost of
the community center, which will feature a 50-meter, Olympic-size swimming
pool.

A chance to dive into the issue

By Stephen Hadley
The Daily News

Published January 03, 2002

There's something about a swimming pool that stirs the proverbial political
pot in a community.

In League City, there is a plan to build a $9.4 million community center that
includes an Olympic-size swimming pool and meeting rooms. The hitch is that
voters have to approve the proposal before it becomes reality. They'll head
to the polls on Feb. 2.

But before they do, the city plans to address questions and concerns about
the project during three public hearings. The first is tonight.

Some of the questions city leaders should answer concern where the proposed
center is going to be built and how much it's going to cost to use it.

Opponents of the deal have voiced both concerns.

Experts hired by the city say the center should be built closer to city hall,
not on county-owned land at Walter Hall Park as is now planned. Some
opponents have questioned whether the center would pose an environmental
threat to Clear Creek if it were built at the park. That's a dialogue city
leaders should have with citizens starting at tonight's meeting.

Is Walter Hall Park the best site for a community center? The intent of
putting it there was so that it would be centrally located, accessible to
residents in League City and people who live in the burgeoning Clear Lake
area.

How much it will cost to use the center has been a point of contention from
the project's infancy. Even the county commissioners, when they agreed to
allow the city to use the park for the center, questioned whether the cost -
$450 a year for a family of four or $2 a day to use the pool - was too much.
They worried whether those who can't afford such rates would be kept from
using a public pool. That's another legitimate question city leaders should
answer tonight.

If the early campaigning is any indication, there probably will be many more
questions this evening.

If you care about the issue, this is one hearing not to miss.

Center election divides community

By Alicia Gooden
The Daily News

Published January 06, 2002

LEAGUE CITY - In three weeks, voters will head to the polls to decide whether
to build a $12.8 million community center in the city.

Supporters say the center could be a tool for economic development, a nucleus
for the League City community and the magnet that attracts national
cheerleading and swimming competitions.

Those who oppose the project say that the city is trying to force all of
League City's residents to pay for a multi-million center that would be used
by a select few, most notably the area's swim leagues

If Thursday's public hearing was any indication, residents are divided over
the project and have plenty of questions.

Whether the measure passes or fails on Feb. 2 could largely hinge on how well
city officials explain the details of paying for the center and just who will
be footing that bill.



Paying the Piper

The cost of the 64,000 square-foot building, which will include an
Olympic-size swimming pool and several meeting rooms, is estimated to be
$12.8 million.

The city has secured $2 million for the project. The rest of the money will
come from the issuance of $9.4 million in certificates of obligation. The
original bond amount was $7.6 million but had to be raised to $9.4 million in
order to cover building costs.

Taxpayers will pay for the maintenance and operations cost of the center in
its first three years through revenue from the general fund, which includes
property taxes, franchise fees and possibly an increase in sales tax revenue
from the 4B Corporation.

The city estimates that the center would generate $850,000 a year in revenue
after three years. Its forecast for the actual expenditures after the three
years is $825,000. Earlier figures showed that the cost of operations would
run between $850,000 to $900,000.

But City Administrator Nick Finan said that after staff members took a harder
look at the numbers, the city was able to find ways to scale back costs by
hiring contract custodial labor as opposed to paid labor.

If the community center gets a green light from voters, the facility will
have a staff of 12 full-time employees and 18 part-time. Their salaries,
which Finan said are included in the $825,000 operations cost, would total
$375,000 a year.

""If we can meet our expectations, then we expect for our revenues to be more
than our expenditures,"" he said.

But if the city does not meet its expectations, Finan said that city council
will have to decide how to handle the shortfall.

""At that time maybe the operations of the facility will be scaled back,"" he
said. ""There are a myriad of ways that can be addressed.""

After the third year, the city anticipates that the center will have between
1,200 and 1,500 full and partial memberships at an estimated yearly cost of
$450 to $275 for aquatics memberships. Fees alone after the third year are
projected to generate $550,000 in revenue.

The certicates on the community center would last 20 years, said Finan. The
payments on the bond note would be $750,000 a year. The city's current
general fund debt is $28.6 million.

The life of the pool is expected to be 25 years to 30 years because it is
indoors and located in the southern part of the country. Finan said if the
referendum should pass, the city would initiate the first issuance of
certificates this summer.



Spreading the Word

Teresa Toungate and the other members of the League City Barracudas swim team
showcased a banner that urged residents to vote for the proposed community
center during the city's holiday parade in December.

The group will soon begin work on fliers and letters sent to other swim teams
asking them to become vocal supporters of the project.

""The way I see it, we have access to 500 people through the swim teams and if
each one of those people tells a friend and then goes to the polls we'll have
one of the larger turnouts that League City has seen in a long time,"" she
said.

The way people like J.A. Willhern see it, there's a lot more the city needs
to get nailed down before he votes for the project. Shiny brochures and
colorful artist renderings aren't enough.

""You (the city) want us to give you a blank check,"" he said to city officials
at Thursday's first public hearing on the community center.

The city has not set fees for the center. It has only estimated the amount
the center would need to one day be self-sustaining.

That move would have been political, said Mayor Tommy Frankovich.

""We could make it look nice in order to get the issue passed and play around
with numbers just to get it,"" he said. ""That's why we kept the numbers
general.""

Frankovich said that future council would set the fees for the community
center if the referendum passes.

The ballot language for Proposition 1 is simple. It asks only whether
residents would or would not support a community center to be built in the
city.

It says nothing of the cost of the facility and how it would be financed.
There was no legal requirement to do so, said Finan. The referendum also does
not tell voters that the measure is binding.

As vehemently as Toungate is about supporting the project, opponents of the
community center are working to kill the deal. They're asking questions,
requesting information and telling those they come in contact with their
opinions.

""No, I will not support it,"" said League City resident Fred Lawrence. ""Right
now, I don't have enough information and I think the information that the
city is giving us is bad for the vote.""

At the top of his concern list is why the city hasn't decided on where to
build the community center. Two options exist - the 5.4 acres the county
agreed to let the city lease in Walter Hall Park or the Arolfo site on 25
acres of land adjacent to city hall.

Project consultants said geo-technical studies show the Arolfo site would be
better suited for what the city wants to build.

""They don't know what they want but they want the voters to make a decision,""
said Elaine Kosty, a former council member.

Opponents contend the project is a gift to the numerous area swim teams. They
said that if the swim teams want the facility, the city should make them pay
for it.

Conversely, many of the community center supporters say that the swimming
pool was promised to them during the 1994 quarter-cent sales tax election.
Revenue from that sales tax initiative was used to build the Sportsplex.

But Toungate said that the community center dialogue has been narrowed to
focus in on only the swimming pool, a portion of the project that the swim
teams have tried to shy away from.

""We understand that that's an ugly issue,"" she said. ""But the focus should be
on the benefit the community center brings to the entire community.""

The swim teams were told upfront, said Toungate, that they would have to pay
for the first-class facility if they wanted it. She said that her team has 
decided that it would pay what was necessary to be able to use the facility.

""We're not asking for any free rides or for the city to cut us any special
deals,"" she said.

The city estimates that teams will be charged $25 an hour for use of the
facility and that up to three teams can use the 50-meter pool at one time.

Toungate said she understands the concerns of older residents and what impact
the community center might have on some of them.

""I understand that older people are not going to use the pool but by the same
token I'm not going to use the senior citizen room,"" she said.


Winner and Losers

Who will ultimately benefit from the center if it is built is debatable. The
city would have a top-notch facility, the only one in the area with an indoor
pool capable of attracting state and national swim meets. It could also have
the pull to get state and national cheerleading competitions in town,
supporters say.

Economic development would benefit, said Finan.

Toungate and other supporters said such athletic meets attract thousands of
people.

""These people will come to our city and spend their money in our city,"" said
Toungate.

These same people could also cause overflow parking problems in the city,
Lawrence.

Close to 400 parking spaces will be needed to accommodate a building the size
of the proposed community center.

""We don't have the restaurants to feed these thousands of people,"" said
Lawrence. ""They're going to go down to Clear Lake and NASA Road 1.""

If the center is built, the city says that according to financial forecasts,
taxes would not have to be raised to support the facility.

But if the city does not make its goal of getting the 1,200 to 1,500
memberships, the costs of running the facility could continue to come from
the general fund or the operations might have to be scaled down, said Finan.

That bothers Lawrence.

""I just don't like the way the whole thing was set up,"" he said.

Toungate is bothered that the project has been viewed so negatively.

""People love to dwell on the negative,"" she said. ""Look at the whole picture.
This center will benefit every age and resident from little children to
senior citizens. That's something positive for the city."""

Notes for this Week's Report:

*  North American Gas has kept its overall average daily EOL deal count 
steady at about 2,950 trades a day since January.  This is about 180 trades a 
day less than the November average of 3,130, which is still the Life to Date 
high.  The overall average daily EOL volumes have remained steady as well.

*  The East and Central Regions of North American Gas have been the main 
reason EOL Gas transactions have remained steady.  The East Region has 
increased its overall average daily EOL deal count by about 20% since 
January, from 632 to 798 deals per day.  The Central Region has increased its 
overall average daily EOL deal count by about 50% since January, from 676 to 
1,018 deals per day.

*  US Power trading via EOL has now levelled off to average daily EOL Deal 
Count of about 452 deals per day.   This is mostly up from 181 deals per day 
in December, to 340 in January, to 449 in February.  In addition, the average 
daily Non-EOL Deal Count has also levelled off at about 483 deals per day.  
The average daily EOL volumes have remained fairly steady.

*  US East Power trading via EOL has now dropped off since February.  It has 
decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 13% since February, from 
359 deals per day to 313.  In addition, the average daily Non-EOL Deal Count 
has now decreased by about 7% since February, from 269 to 250 deals per day.  
The average daily EOL volumes have remained steady.

*  UK Gas trading has continued to see a steady increase since December on 
EOL.  They were averaging close to 51 transactions per day in December 2000.  
Recently they have been climbing to 81 deals per day in January, 111 in 
February, and now 167 in March.  This represents about a 227% increase.

*  LPG's has decreased its total monthly EOL deal count from a consistent 450 
trades or so from November through January, to only 250 trades in the month 
of February, and only about 84 trades so far in the month of March .  This 
represents about a 62% decrease from previous months.  The total monthly EOL 
volumes have decreased similarly as well.

*  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has increased since February, from a 
daily average of 497 to a daily average of 629 for March.  This represents 
about a 27% increase.  The average daily EOL volumes have increased as well.

199,"The FIX module v1.0 is now operational and meets all the specifications as 
shown in the FRS.  The team would be happy to show you a demo at your 
convenience, perhaps early next week.  We anticipate our back office using 
FIX in parallel with existing systems for December 2000, and then using FIX 
""under fire"" for January 2001 invoices.

The demo uses actual data from Sempra, our largest volume natgas financial 
counterparty.  In about a minute, FIX is able to compare Enron data and 
Sempra data (received electronically as an excel spreadsheet and stored on a 
mini version of our Deal Database), immediately matching about 1450 of the 
1500 deals.  It then helps the user to manually match those 50 deals that the 
primary match engine could not.  This whole process, if it were purely 
manual, would take more than a day.  Using excel spreadsheets (and sort 
functions), Enron currently spends 4 to 8 hours per month matching Sempra 
invoices. FIX allows the user to perform all matching in about 10 minutes.

Our next deliverable is the Confirm Central module v1.0, due 1 December.  We 
anticipate delivering it on time, as we have with FIX.


All the best,

Attached is an outline of the involvement we've engaged AA to perform for 
each business unit as they go-live onto SAP.  Please remember that ENA is 
going live onto SAP's ""common design"" that has already been reviewed by AA 
from a internal controls perspective.  So this attachment outlines those 
items outside of ""common design"" that Wanda and Sally  probably want covered 
from an ENA perspective.  As a rule of thumb, this proposed scope equates to 
$100k - $150k in fees to AA that is over & above the audit budget.

One word of advice:  Designate a lead within ENA that has the time to stay on 
top of the project, schedule meetings with AA, and coordinate their 
involvement with the SAP team members, e.g. not Wanda or Sally, but at a 
director/manager level at least.  I was the designee for Corp and ensured 
that AA kept the project going.  Also, I worked extensively with the Janet 
Tran, SAP lead director responsible for bringing Corp up.  Some big benefits:
Kept AA out of SAP's hair when things got rough.
Made sure that the SAP team knew what our goals & objectives were, especially 
when we found something that needed fixed before go-live.
Managed that in fact AA provided us a deliverable at the end of the project.

Please review and call if you need other info.  I'd be glad to assist ENA 
too.  I assisted Europe (Naomi Connell) and Int'l cos (John Berggren).  They 
appreciated having a ""co-pilot"" and we avoided duplication of effort with 
what had already been done for the prior go-lives.  Also, they felt that 
value was rec'd for dollars paid to AA for this work.

223,"Draft - for your review...not sure who to say to 'report to'......although 
obviously it's you.


We are pleased to announce that Barry Pearce, Vice President, will be joining 
Enron Broadband Services as Global Controller of Trading Support Operations. 
Barry, who will be based in Houston and report functionally to both Jim 
Fallon and John Echols, will assume responsibility for the on-going 
day-to-day control and development of EBS's trading support infra-structure.

Recognizing that EBS's increasing trading operations worldwide are ever 
expanding, there is a need to insure outstanding internal controls are in 
place for all trading and risk management activities, regardless of location. 
Barry's responsibilities with regard to Global Trading Support Operations 
will mirror those of other Controller functions throughout Enron. In this 
role, Barry will work closely with Sally Beck's Global Risk Management Group 
to insure that EBS is focused on best practice throughout the front and back 
office functions, including Risk Book Management, Deal Capture, Contract 
Administration, Contract Settlements and Trading Accounting. Barry's group 
will also help ensure operational systems are developed to facilitate the 
timely and accurate reporting of all trading activities and that key 
operational procedures and processes are implemented.   

Barry has been with Enron since 1992, when he joined the company from Arthur 
Andersen. Barry has spent the last five years in London playing an integral 
part in the development and success of the support operations of ECT Europe. 
He moves to EBS from his current job as VP, European Gas and Power Trading 
Support Operations. 

Please join us in wishing Barry  success in his new role.

225,"Today's ENA PRC was a pre-ranking session for VP's.  All VP's will be 
reviewed at an Enron-wide PRC scheduled for early August.  Representatives at 
that Enron PRC from ENA will be Janet Dietriech, Dave Delainey, John Lavorato 
and Greg Piper.  They will use information from today's ENA PRC meeting in 
representing you at the Enron-wide VP PRC.  I have provided copies of your 
accomplishments and consolidated supervisor feedback forms to Dave Delainey 
for reference during that process.  

Your reviews will be given after the Enron-wide VP PRC, and will not be 
completed before the end of July.  I will schedule an August date with you 
for your review as soon as I know the exact date of the final PRC meeting.  

Separately, you both should sign up for the Executive Influence and Impact 
course that is required of VP's.  I thought that the course was very good.  
All VP's are strongly encouraged to complete this course.  It is a 2 or 3 day 
course that is offered every month or two here in Houston.  I would contact 
Dick Amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this.

her and talk with her even if at first blush that may not be your first 
interest.  Can't hurt to hear about what she is doing and spend some time 
with her.  You may not then be interested in her rotation, but you'll know 
more and she will know you.

Sheri, Andy Zipper, John Cummings, and Surresh have met to discuss space, and all agree that Sheri's group needs to be located with their groups.  My understanding is that you have designated a certain number of spaces for ENW on the trading floors, but that Sheri's group is not included in that count.  Can we get together when you return to the office next week and discuss floor space?  Thanks.  --Sally "

I am glad that your meeting with Tom was fruitful and I am pleased that there may be a fit between Enron's needs and Vivance's offerings.  I know that Cindy is very enthusiastic about the quality product that Viviance delivers, so creating a win-win situation for both companies would be great.  I have e-mailed JIm Martino to keep me posted to the extent there is anything that I can do to help move along the process.  While I won't make the business decision here, I can certainly help to focus attention when needed.

232,"As a follow up to last Thursday's lunch meeting, Scott Mills and Mary Lynn Ruffer are working with Evan Hughes to further define Option 2 that we discussed regarding the settlements function.  To recap, with that option, EWS would assume internal management of the settlements function, including managing data requirements to and from the outsource providers,  and EES would retain the service management function, defining service levels and pricing, plus serving as the interface with EES customers.  

We will review with Tim, Kevin, Don and Rogers the more detailed recommendations from this team by mid week.  Then we should have a final proposal of roles and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function before the end of this week.  

Please call me in the interim if you have any questions or suggestions.  --Sally   (x35926)   "

234,"Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller 
Forum.  There will be approximately 30 Enron business controllers present at 
the meeting.  All have responsibility for mid and back office operations for 
the following Enron entities:  Enron North America, Enron Europe, Enron South 
America, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband 
Services and Enron Energy Services.  Attendees will be here from Houston, 
Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York (metals business).   

Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes 
before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to 
be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.


You are scheduled to address the group as follows:

Date:  Monday, October 23, 2000
Time:  4:00 pm
Place:  The Warwick Hotel
  The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 
  5701 Main Street
  Houston,  TX  77005

I have noted that your topic will be assessing, measuring and managing credit 
risk.  Any references that you could make to the importance of information 
flow between credit and operations would be great to cover.  Feel free to 
offer up a challenge to the group.  

I am glad that you will be able to join us for the tour of Enron Field and 
for dinner at Ruggles Center Field Terrace on Monday evening.

235,"I don't think that John Jacobsen should be reviewed in London.  Pulp & paper 
is still an ENA group, even though we have John reporting to you.  I would 
not roll that up under Global Products as it exists today.  We did review him 
in our PRC.  For some reason, HR has confused the issue with the Pulp & Paper 
employees by putting them under Global Products rather than ENA, a step they 
took I believe without any outside direction.  Does this make sense to you?

238,"Yes, Harold Powell is providing the clothes for the show.  Beverly Scott, 
with Harold Powell, is coordinating and commentating.  She offered to call 
all the girls to set times for them to come in and choose outfits.  I was 
planning to do that as a go-between, but when she offered to coordinate that 
I decided to take her up on it.  She just moved her daughter back to Baylor, 
so she was to begin calling the girls on Monday this week (I had given her a 
list of names and numbers).  I talked with Linda Smithey this morning and she 
had not heard from Beverly yet, either, so I am concerned that she hasn't 
called everyone on the list.  I took Meagan in on Monday night to choose 
outfits, and Beverly had some great ideas on music, commentary, etc., so I 
know that she is working on it.  Just a little more slowly than I would 
like!  

I have a call in to her to see if I need to take some time from work today 
and make calls.  Why don't you call Beverly directly today and just 
coordinate a time for Jenny to go by.  Her number at work is 281-444-0751.

Not much unpacking yet -- our main focus up until Sunday morning was getting 
Amanda ready for camp.  There was still a good bit of painting going on this 
week, so this weekend I do hope to get quite a bit unpacked.  

We got our first letter from Amanda yesterday , and it sounds as if she is 
having fun.  Said that she was homesick and missed us, but was not sad.  Has 
some of the same girls in her cabin that she had last summer.  

I plan to shop this weekend for your birthday gift for Amanda.  As we 
discussed, she will have a continuation of her birthday when she gets back 
home next weekend.  So by the end of the weekend I should be able to give a 
total for gifts for both girls.

"
244,"I made the assumption when you said that Jim Fallon had said that Kristin's 
name was ""in play"", that he and Kristin had coordinated a transition with 
Kevin Presto that made him comfortable.  At an ENA offsite meeting on 
Wednesday and Thursday last week, I talked with Kevin during a break to see 
if was comfortable with Kristin's number two as his risk lead.  
Unfortunately, Kevin knew nothing about this.  So rather than discuss the 
transition, Kevin had to react to and absorb this as a possibility.  He had 
some very valid business reasons as to why Kristin's movement over the summer 
months would be risky for ENA.  You and I can discuss those if you would 
like.  His reaction was not ""never"", but instead was ""not now"".  He and 
Kristin talked on Friday and agreed to a transition in mid August.  Let's

"
249,"I won't bury you with constant examples, but am copying you on this note 
regarding floor meetings.  While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, 
I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our 
commercialization effort.  They are not in the habit of considering the 500 
people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.  Floor 
meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and 
yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with 
our reorganization late last fall.  I will diligently work with Philippe and 
Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net 
Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key 
Enron businesses that we support.  I suspect that motivating and managing in 
this environment will become increasingly challenging.  This is an FYI more

252,"It didn't occur to me until seeing Richard's message that we might have a 
hole in communications with Mary being out on an extended basis.  We should 
probably create a message on Mary's phone that refers callers to someone else 
- ditto on e:mail messages.  Beth, does it make sense for that referral to be 
James, or you, or Vanessa?  Others within our organization that may try to 
reach Mary could have questions about global databases, projects that Joel's 
group had been handling, etc.  I am not trying to put this off on you if you 
don't think it is appropriate - but James and/or Vanessa came to mind as 
possible contacts.  By copy to Hector, I also wonder if we should review 
incoming e:mails that have come to Mary over the last several weeks to see if 
there are some internal requests to which we need to respond.  Let me know

Thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk. =
 We will certainly name an appropriate person from Operations to be involve=
d in this project, and will work with you to help in achieving your objecti=
ves.  There doesn't appear to be anyone from ETS on your distribution list.=
  Operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of Enron's =
businesses.  Is the initial focus simply on the ""wholesale businesses"", or =
is there an intent to make this enterprise-wide? =20

I suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list t=
o have a context for the way in which you see this RAC initiative complemen=
ting, replacing, overlapping, or perhaps duplicating the work of EAS, AA's =
internal audit engagement, the critical self assessment process being pilot=
ed in London this year by the operations team in conjuction with the AA aud=
its, Doorstep reviews, current operational risk reporting done by the vario=
us operations teams, and our major initiatives for EES tracked every other =
Thursday with you and Rick Causey.   Before we each choose our appropriate =
representatives from our respective areas, it might be constructive to cove=
r this in a kick-off meeting with the addressees on your memo. =20

I might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilit=
ies at the beginning of this project.  The creation of a framework for quan=
tifying enterprise-wide operational risk is perhaps different from the impl=
ementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit=
 levels.  As on other policies devised by RAC, it would seem that implement=
ation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the to-be-deve=
loped operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business uni=
t/functional area outside RAC.  The cross-functional team that will be form=
ed is probably best used to give input to RAC in creating the policy, but m=
ay not necessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiat=
ives. =20

Finally, the second bullet point in Wanda's list below is already being add=
ressed through the project that you and I agreed upon in August to insure t=
hat information from all source systems to RisktRAC is complete, accurate a=
nd efficiently handled. As you and I discussed, this is a global effort spa=
nning all commodities/all locations/all source systems.   We have formed a =
steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closel=
y with Debbie Brackett in defining the scope, approach, key milestones, res=
ource requirements and projected timeline (Project Greenlight).  A team of =
stakeholders from Operations, IT and Debbie Brackett will meet tomorrow in =
order to review the project plan with David Port and Bill Bradford for fina=
l input.  My assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for D=
ebbie and me to review the work done to date and to review the proposed pla=
n and timeline.   Assuming that you are comfortable with Project Greenlight=
 when we review the details with you,  I think that it would be appropriate=
 to take this item off of the Wanda's list.  We can certainly update the cr=
oss-functional team on efforts underway, but there is no need for a new tea=

293,"PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:

Mike Peterson asked me to send you the following note, with attached order:

Attached is an Order signed yesterday and entered this morning by Judge Rosenthal on Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO and Preliminary Injunctive Relief (including a freeze of defendants' ""insider trading proceeds"") - i.e., the matter on which there was a hearing with attendant media hoopla last month.

You probably recall that at the end of the hearing, Judge Rosenthal asked for briefing on a rather arcane legal point concerning whether or not the Court had authority to issue the requested preliminary relief, and the parties submitted briefs on this matter on December 15 and December 21. 

In the attached Order, Judge Rosenthal concludes that the Court does have the requisite authority, but the present record does not contain evidence warranting a freeze of any individual defendant's proceeds from the sale of Enron stock.

You might take further comfort from two additional points in the Court's opinion: (a) at several places, the Court clearly indicates that any ""freeze"" or other such injunctive relief as to any defendant would have to be predicated on an individualized evidentiary showing as to that defendant; and (b) the Court indicates that plaintiffs would have to satisfy a very difficult ""tracing"" requirement to establish a right to a constructive trust or freeze (i.e., ""trace"" a specific asset or fund of money held by any defendant back to the profits of an improper insider trade).

The aspects of the Court's opinion that arguably are favorable to the plaintiffs are (a) the discussion of ""an equitable accounting,"" wherein the Court suggests that the plaintiffs might be able to satisfy the requirements for an order that defendants account for profits earned by trading Enron securities between October 1998 and November 2001; and (b) providing an opportunity (through January 23) for plaintiffs to file a brief addressing whatever expedited discovery they believe they are entitled to as to the individual defendants, ""particularly as to . . . Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, and Andrew Fastow.""

We will, of course, advise you of any further developments.

312,"  Bill, we had an air inspection at the facility a couple of weeks ago and 
all went well.  Prior to the state visit, we went through a ""trouble 
shooting"" scenario and found out that Solar provided us with innacurate 
permitting information for that altitude and temperature.  Solar was very 
helpful and provided us with updated information to reflect conditions at the 
facility.  I submitted a permit revision and it was submitted to the state of 
Colorado prior to their inspection, requesting more fuel but no more 
emissions.  Recent testing has shown that even under extreme low 
temperatures, the emissions are under the original permitted levels.  Because 
we did not request additional emissions, I expect the permit to be issued 
within the next couple of months..... bottom line is that no NOV will be 
issued for the fuel use issue.

MEMO


Date:          December 8, 2000

From:          William J. Museler, President & Chief Executive Officer

To:       Steven J. Balser, Manager of Market Monitoring and Performance
James H. Savitt, Market Monitor

Re:       Extraordinary Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw:
External Proxy Bus Prices During Transmission Constraints
(ECA 20001208B; re-issuance of ECA 20001006B)


Thank  you  for  the  presentation of the Market Monitoring and Performance
Unit  and  the Market Advisor regarding the progress that has been made with 
the
Market Participants in addressing the market design flaw in the Real-Time 
energy
markets  concerning  external  proxy  bus  prices during transmission 
limitation
periods.  I am pleased that the Business Issues Committee gave unanimous 
support
to  the  NYISO  to  re-issue  ECA  20001006B  until  the Market Participants 
can
consider  and  approve, and the NYISO can implement, a tariff change required 
to
permanently address the Market Design Flaw.

As  stated  in  my Memorandum to you of October 6, 2000, I agreed with your
conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a 

?Market Design
Flaw?  as  defined  in  Attachment  Q  to  the ISO OATT, Temporary 
Extraordinary
Procedures  for  Correcting  Market  Design  Flaws  and  Addressing 
Transitional
Abnormalities (the ?TEPs?).  As further stated in that Memorandum, I agreed 
with
your  analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw 
would,
absent  appropriate  action,  remain  different  from what would otherwise 
occur
during periods of efficient competition.

I  have  now  determined,  based  on  consultations  with ISO Staff and the
support  of the Business Issues Committee, that it is appropriate to maintain 
in
effect  the  corrective measures adopted as ECA 20001006B while consultation 
and
cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is 
on-going
to  develop  and  implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance 
with
the ISO Agreement.

Please re-issue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action (?ECA?) and
post  it  on  the  OASIS,  for implementation effective at the expiration of 
ECA
20001006B.  The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety (90) days.

New York Independent System Operator

Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208B

Market Design Flaw Regarding Real-Time External Proxy Bus Prices


Applicability

This  Extraordinary  Correction Action (ECA) shall apply when the following
two conditions are met:

?    Transactions are proposed for an operating hour at an External Proxy Bus;
and
?    The Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) resolves transmission congestion
constraints at the External Proxy Bus for the operating hour, resulting in
transmission congestion charges in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM).

Rationale

When BME solves for proposed transactions at an External Proxy Bus, and the
total  proposed  transactions  exceed  the available transfer capacity, BME 
will
resolve binding constraints at that External Proxy Bus using the decremental 
bid
price  or  the sink price cap bid indicated by the Market Participants 
proposing
the transactions.

In  the  operating hour, the transfer capability and scheduled flows at the
External  Proxy  Bus  are  fixed,  and  SCD  is  not  required  to  resolve  
for
transmission  congestion  costs  associated  with  the  scheduled  
transactions.
Therefore, in operating hours where an External Proxy Bus constraint is 
binding,
Real-Time  prices at the External Proxy Bus will be significantly different 
from
the  HAM  prices,  due  to  the  absence  of transmission congestion costs 
being
reflected  in  the Real-Time price.  Currently, scheduled HAM transactions at 
an
External  Proxy Bus are settled at the Real-Time price at the External Proxy 
Bus
during  the operating hour, and the import transactions receive a Bid 
Production
Cost Guarantee for the deviation in price between the HAM and Real-Time price.

The  Market  Design  Flaw  in  the  current  process  is  that transmission
congestion  constraints  present  when  BME  schedules  HAM transactions are 
not
reflected  in the Real-Time settlement prices.  Under the rules set forth 
below,
the  transmission  congestion  costs present in BME will be reflected in the 
SCD
prices, so that a Market Participant proposing a HAM transaction will be 
charged
the  full  cost of supplying that transaction, up to the decremental bid cost 
or
sink  price  cap  bid  indicated  by  the Market Participant at the time the 
HAM
transaction was proposed.

Implementation Rules

1.   These rules apply in hours that HAM import or export transactions are
constrained in BME at an External Proxy Bus (EPB) by a transmission limitation
or Desired Network Interchange (DNI) limit (an ?EPB Limit?).

2.   For each hour in which an EPB Limit constrains net imports to NYCA from 
an
External Proxy Bus in the HAM, the Real-Time settlement price at that External
Proxy Bus will be the lesser of the real-time LBMP or the BME price at that
External Proxy Bus.

3.   For each hour which an EPB Limit constrains net exports from NYCA to an
External Proxy Bus in the HAM, the Real-Time settlement price at that External
Proxy Bus will be the greater of the real-time LBMP or the BME price at that
External Proxy Bus.

Here is the DFG-1603 notification cover letter and Attachment 1 (project
description and responses to questionnaire). This notification is required
for any disturbance of streams, rivers, wetlands, etc.  Unfortunately, the
State DFG requires notification as the area in question appears as a ""blue
line"" on USGS maps and is also a designated floodway.  The actual DFG forms
(2 pg notification and 3 pg enviro. questionnaire) and attachments will be
faxed to you and hard copy Fed-Ex'd today.  The other attachments are

325,"I spoke with Ken Jacobs, with the Forest Service in Flagstaff, concerning his 
agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.  As a condition 
of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine 
trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for 
identification.  After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him 
so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest 
Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges 
will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.  The charges will 
depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the 
trees which are flagged.

As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits 
and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged 
and I will contact Ken Jacobs so that he can make a site visit."
326,"I attended a meeting on July 30 with the Texas Intrastate Pipeline 
Association where TNRCC personnel made a presentation on the implementation 
of the grandfather legislation and Charlie Child attended a meeting on August 
7 where TNRCC also made a presentation on the grandfather legislation. 

The following existing authorization options are available for grandfathered 
sources: old Standard Exemptions, Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits 
(VERP), regular permits or Permits By Rule.  The grandfather legislation, 
which is still in the rulemaking process, is for permitting grandfathered 
sources that have not been authorized by the existing options.  These 
programs are discussed below.

Old Standard Exemptions
As you know, ETS has implemented a program to authorize grandfathered 
emission sources under old Standard Exemptions (now Permits by Rule) wherever 
possible so they would not be subject to the grandfather regulations. TNRCC 
indicated at the meeting that you would have until the deadlines for 
submitting applications (9/1/03 in east Texas and 9/1/04 in West Texas) to 
authorize the sources under old St. Ex.  Keep in mind that this program is 
not part of the TNRCC regulations-it is being implemented under a verbal 
agreement with the TNRCC and could change at any moment.  TNRCC recommended 
that PI-7 forms be submitted for all locations that are included on their 
1997 list of emission sources (Note: the list is based on TNRCC's listing of 
1997 emissions inventories and Ruth has distributed this list to the 
appropriate DESs). For locations not on this list, internal records would be 
sufficient and nothing needs to be submitted to TNRCC (unless required under 
the conditions of the St.Ex.). One thing to keep in mind is that TNRCC is 
revising the rules governing Permits by Rule/St. Ex. with increased 
recordkeeping requirements so that any emission sources authorized by St.Ex. 
will be subject to the new recordkeeping rules (scheduled to be finalized on 
9/26/01).  It is recommended that the Standard Exemption submittals be 
received by the TNRCC as soon as possible.  In addition to engines, old 
Standard Exemptions or existing Permits By Rule should be used for the 
remaining grandfathered sources (tanks, heaters, etc.).

Grandfather Legislation
The grandfather legislation includes a specific permit for reciprocating 
engines.  Other grandfather sources must obtain an ""Existing Facility Permit"" 
under the legislation.  Unlike the Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits 
(VERP) program, there is no amnesty granted for modifications uncovered 
during the permitting process.  Discovery of a modification may result in 
enforcement action.  In addition, the source is no longer eligible for a 
grandfather permit and must obtain a regular permit or Permit By Rule and be 
subject to BACT (~2 g/bhp-hr).  In order to take advantage of the VERP 
program amnesty provision, TNRCC is urging industry to submit VERP 
applications by the August 31, 2001 deadline.

Under the grandfather legislation, grandfathered reciprocating engines in 
East Texas are subject to 50% reductions of NOx and may be subject to 50% 
reductions of VOC. Recips in West Texas are subject to up to 20% reductions 
of NOx and VOC. The reductions will be determined on a case-by case basis by 
the permit engineer reviewing the application. Although previously there was 
hope that no reductions would be required in West Texas, at the August 7 
meeting TNRCC indicated that they would require at least 1% reductions in 
West Texas. TNRCC has not decided how to deal with VOC reductions but one 
TNRCC staff member did mention he was aware that oxidation catalysts could 
reduce VOC emissions on engines.

In the August 7 meeting, TNRCC indicated that the reductions for recips will 
be calculated from a baseline of the average actual emissions in 1997-9. This 
was not the intent of the legislation and the legislators will be contacted 
by our industry organizations to attempt to change this. My thinking is that 
the reductions will likely be based on a ""before"" hourly grams/hp-hr rate 
from stack testing (or maybe AP-42) and an ""after"" hourly emissions rate 
based on stack testing. 

The reductions required from recips can be averaged across a pipeline, but 
reductions mandated by a regulation cannot be included. Reductions from a 
shutdown of an emission source can be included in the average, and it was 
suggested that reductions since 1997 could be included, but this has not been 
determined. It is highly unlikely that that TNRCC will allow reductions in 
East Texas to be averaged with reductions in West Texas.

Grandfathered emission sources other than recips are subject to 10-year old 
BACT. When discussing whether there would be any relief for smaller emission 
sources such as grandfathered valves or flanges, the TNRCC attorney indicated 
that there is no lower threshold and that all emissions sources must be 
authorized either by the existing authorizations or grandfather permits by 
the deadlines in  this legislation. See the notes above about the locations 
that TNRCC expects paperwork to be submitted for St. Ex.

The control/reduction deadlines for reducing emissions from all grandfathered 
emission sources is 3/1/07 in East Texas and 3/1/08 in West Texas. However 
TNRCC indicated that controls will likely be required prior to these dates. 
When you receive your permit for grandfathered sources, they anticipate that 
you will have 18 months to install controls. Since the applications are due 
on 9/1/03 and 9/1/04, and  TNRCC has one year to process applications (but it 
could be less), you should anticipate being required to install controls in 
2005-2007. The application fee may be $450.

The grandfather rule will be proposed on October 24, 2001 and should be 
finalized in March 2002.

329,"On Wednesday, October 20th, I contacted Ms. Barbara Bernacik at the Office of 
the Pueblo of Laguna, Division of Environment. I contacted Ms. Bernacik at 
the suggestion of Norm Gonzales (TW Laguna Team) to discuss outstanding 
environmental issues at the Station. 

In a conversation with Norm the previous week, Norm indicated to me that he 
had met with Ms. Bernacik and Ray Lucero (Engineer, Pueblo of Laguna) 
recently in regards to backfilling an open excavation which had been 
excavated in 1993 when a diesel UST was removed from the site. The excavation 
had not been backfilled pending authorization from the Pueblo of Laguna. This 
and other outstanding issues were discussed in a meeting with Ray Lucero, the 
Governor of the Pueblo of Laguna, Ted Ryther, Larry Campbell, Butch Russell, 
and myself back in 1995 but there was no resolution of the issues, primarily 
because at the time the Laguna's did not have an environmental staff person 
to address such issues. Subsequently, Ms. Bernacik was hired as the Laguna's 
environmental staff person about two years ago. 

In the course of Norm's conversation with Ms. Bernacik and Mr. Lucero, Mr. 
Lucero indicated some concern that the Pueblo of Laguna had not been kept 
apprised of environmental issues at the Station. In light of this, I have 
prepared a ""Report of Groundwater Monitoring Activities"". This report covers 
monitoring activities between June 1994 and June 1999. As previously 
mentioned, I also contacted Ms. Bernacik for the purpose of introducing 
myself and to inform her that a report has been prepared and will be 
delivered to her office. I also suggested that we meet at the site to discuss 
outstanding environmental issues. The response from Ms. Bernacik was very 
favorable and we agreed to meet at the site at 10:00 am November 16th. Ms. 
Bernacik also indicated that someone from the BIA will be with her."

359,"Guys, with respect to the above, as you know, WGR was responsible for all compliance submittals during the time that we owned and they operated.  I know in the past, prior to their taking over ownership, I would remind them each year that a particular document was requried.  I figured that when they became owners, they didnt need me anymore.  Louie, you are right, Phil Moyer was the environmental contact for WGR and he was the one I would contact and apprise.  It just so happens that I have copies of previous annual submittals from WGR for the Gomez facility  when the facility was under our ownership, their responsibility.  I even have a copy of the Title V Permit.  When I was told that we no longer owned the faclity, I sent all information I had to WGR, but kept copies of the stuff I had, just in case.  I can send it one more time if you want me too.  Let me know....."

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

384,"TXS, I'll incorporate in the write-up

 "
385,"
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken"

390,"Michelle, when we were checking out 280G issues, we came across this.  I am worried because it appears they slipped in a UK citizen.....we did not run the traps on the U.K.  I fear the worst!!!!  Since I have not given Wachovia the names yet we could remedy but need to move fast......I hesitate to call anyone until we can touch base given the sensitivity.  Also, how will we pay from the Trust and not let Europe know....they'll be wanting to pay him too!!!!  Please advise.

Hope you are enjoying the cruise.

393,"Hi Team,
 
Just wanted to clarify some decisions arising out of last week's N-Form Team meeting regarding the Working Environment policy...
 

Remove the phrase, ""...and the use of other tobacco products..."" from the activities limited by our smoking policy, as employees in field locations regularly use these products, and enforcement would be virtually impossible.
Clarify acceptable locations for smoking activity, as the definition for ""workplace"" used for alcohol and drugs is too narrow for smoking.
Review ""workplace"" definition...this is a composite from several sources...please provide feedback as to whether it should be revised, i.e. Michelle suggested adding ""parking lots.""

Workplace - Includes all Enron premises and any location where company business is being conducted or in which employees perform essential job functions, including all property, land, onshore and offshore platforms, office buildings, structures, installations, training facilities, plants, pipelines, boats, aircraft, and vehicles which are Enron-owned, leased, used, or operated, or which are located on Company property; as well as fenced areas to which general public access is denied or limited by Enron.  Also covered are any personal effects or items, including desks, lockers, workstations, personal belongings, and privately owned vehicles located on or in Company property.

Leave in the phrase, ""...attending an Enron-sponsored function off Company premises..."" in referencing locations where an employee should not be impaired by alcohol or drugs, as reasonable efforts are made to provide safe transportation and/or other options for impaired employees at Enron-sponsored social functions.
Add references to the state and federal Drug Free Workplace Act and non-DOT policies.
Stance on driving safety proposal is to state that the use of communication devices while driving poses a significant risk and that employees should comply with applicable law and business unit practices.
Michelle - in your notes, you commented, ""What about drug testing?""  How much and which information would you like to see on this topic?

Have I missed anything?
 
Thanks so much for your time and assistance,
Karen

01-158  A Valid Employment Arbitration Agreement May Preclude Class Action Lawsuits <http://www.eeac.org/private/01-158.pdf>  EEAC's analysis reveals that there is support in the federal case law for concluding that an enforceable agreement to arbitrate employment disputes may cut off the option of bringing a class action lawsuit.

404,"Drew,

At one point, we had mentioned the idea of having services agreements among 
Corp. and the various business units that are using shared services.  I think 
that these agreements should be put into place sooner rather than later as we 
begin to move towards shared services across the organization.

Let me know if you would like me to prepare the drafts of these agreements or 
revise agreements that currently are in existence (if there are none, then we 
really need to put some in place).

Would you or someone in your group please investigate the allegations raised

Once you have conducted the investigation, please provide me with the results.

408,"Privileged and Confidential
This email contains legal advice and confidentiality should be maintained

The attached memo describes a recent decision from the National Labor 
Relations Board regarding an employee's right to be ""represented"" by a 
co-worker or other person during a disciplinary meeting.  Employees in 
unionized settings always have had this right, but it now has been extended 
by the NLRB's ruling.

 The ruling was contentious -- there were dissents -- and I expect it to be 
appealed quickly.  Nonetheless, if an Enron employee wants to have someone 
sit in on a disciplinary meeting, please call me to discuss how to proceed 
before responding to that request.  We want to be careful to avoid a finding 
of an unfair labor practice.

Thanks.  Michelle

409,"Chuck,

Do we have a rescheduled date for the deposition of the plaintiff?  Given the 
correspondence I've been receiving about rescheduling other depositions, we 
probably should set forth a date in Nov/Dec and get a protective order from 
the court stating that it cannot be rescheduled.  Otherwise, even if we do 
""agree"" on dates, there likely would be additional delays.  I am ready to 
hear what this guy has to say about my client.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

I just don't want people to say someone is satisfactory and meets

ALPHARETTA, Ga., July 16, 2001 (press release) -- Schweitzer-Mauduit Intern=
ational, Inc. (NYSE: SWM - news) today announced a plan to restructure its =
Brazilian operations and exit the printing and writing uncoated papers busi=
ness in Brazil in response to current business conditions. A pre-tax charge=
 of approximately $4.5 to $5.0 million will be taken in the second quarter =
of 2001 to implement this restructuring. Excluding this unusual item, the C=
ompany anticipates diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 200=
1 to be in the range of $.52 to $.54 per share. Second quarter diluted earn=
ings per share in 2000 were $.41.=20
Brazilian Restructuring=20
Wayne H. Deitrich, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, comme=
nted that, ``Recent changes in Brazilian business conditions made it necess=
ary for Schweitzer-Mauduit to reassess its ability to continue to compete e=
ffectively in the printing and writing uncoated papers market. Sales volume=
s during the past six months have been unfavorably impacted by a slowdown i=
n the Brazilian printing and writing papers market as well as by a decision=
 by the Company to reduce its sales of certain grades of these papers that =
have been negatively impacted by ICMS, a form of value-added business tax. =
In addition, the recently enacted electricity rationing program in Brazil h=
as necessitated production curtailments in our Brazilian operations. The pr=
inting and writing uncoated papers business is our least profitable product=
 line in Brazil while being our largest electricity user.''=20
The decision to exit the printing and writing uncoated papers business in B=
razil will result in a pre-tax charge in the second quarter of 2001 of appr=
oximately $4.5 to $5.0 million, or $.20 to $.22 per share, for a non-cash w=
rite-off of assets. In addition, a further pre-tax charge of approximately =
$0.5 to $0.7 million, or $.02 to $.03 per share, will be taken in the third=
 quarter, primarily related to employee termination and severance costs. Sc=
hweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil's net sales of printing and writing uncoated pap=
ers totaled approximately $25 million in 2000. Because of cost reduction st=
eps to be implemented as part of the restructuring, exiting the printing an=
d writing uncoated papers business is not expected to have a material impac=
t on ongoing operating results after the restructuring is fully implemented=
, which should occur by year-end 2001.=20
Brazilian Energy Situation=20
In late May, the Brazilian government announced the details of its electric=
ity rationing program which has an overall objective of a 20 percent reduct=
ion in electricity consumption and mandates a 25 percent reduction in elect=
ricity consumption by the paper industry in the most populated and industri=
alized regions of Brazil. The reduction is calculated from prior-year avera=
ge electricity consumption. The reduction must be measured and achieved for=
 consecutive thirty-day periods commencing May 31, 2001. Failure to achieve=
 the mandated reductions would result in higher electricity rates and cuts =
in electrical power service. The duration of the government's energy reduct=
ion directive is uncertain although it is expected to last at least six mon=
ths, through the traditional ``dry period'' in Brazil. The government's for=
ced consumption reduction program is in response to unusually low water lev=
els in the lakes and reservoirs supplying Brazil's hydroelectric facilities=
 that provide 90 percent of that country's electricity.=20
In response to the Brazilian government's energy reduction directive, Schwe=
itzer-Mauduit do Brasil implemented a four-part electricity reduction progr=
am. All nonessential nonmanufacturing uses of electricity are being elimina=
ted including cuts in air conditioning, reduced lighting and changes in the=
 operation of the water and effluent treatment plants. Manufacturing proces=
s modifications are being implemented to achieve more energy-efficient usag=
e of equipment where product quality will not be compromised. A comprehensi=
ve energy conservation training program is being conducted for Brazilian em=
ployees and contracted service providers of the Company to increase awarene=
ss and solicit ideas for additional electricity reduction. To achieve the 2=
5 percent electrical consumption reduction target, it has also been necessa=
ry to implement production curtailments. Machine downtime has been taken to=
 reduce the production of the Company's least profitable products.=20
Mr. Deitrich added that, ``Schweitzer-Mauduit does not expect the governmen=
t's electricity reduction program to significantly affect the demand for or=
 its ability to produce tobacco-related papers. Likewise, the availability =
of the Company's major raw materials such as wood pulp, chemicals and chalk=
 and the ability to receive raw materials and ship finished product are not=
 expected to be materially impacted. Exiting the printing and writing uncoa=
ted papers business will permit Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil to better focu=
s on and service its other product lines.''=20
Anticipated Second Quarter Results=20
Excluding the unusual charge associated with restructuring the Brazilian op=
erations, the Company anticipates diluted earnings per share for the second=
 quarter of 2001 to be in the range of $.52 to $.54 per share. Operating pr=
ofit improvement is anticipated in both the French and U.S. business units =
compared with the prior-year quarter. Results for the quarter are expected =
to benefit from increased tobacco-related papers sales volumes, lower wood =
pulp costs and improvement in average selling prices. The average per ton l=
ist price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp in the United States was=
 $570 per metric ton in the second quarter of 2001 compared with $680 per m=
etric ton in the second quarter of 2000. These positive factors will be par=
tially offset by higher purchased energy costs and expenses related to the =
banded cigarette paper project and resultant higher cost of operations at t=
he Spotswood, New Jersey mill.=20
Schweitzer-Mauduit will issue its second quarter 2001 earnings press releas=
e on Thursday, July 26, 2001. The Company will hold a conference call to re=
view second quarter results with investors and analysts at 10:30 a.m. easte=

I have investigated the procedure for picking up Aeros' tickets at the ""Will

Center.  Much to my surprise, the Aeros' ""Will Call"" window is located in
their office at Wilcrest and Richmond.  They have four tickets for the Erbs
and three tickets for the Kudlas.  I drive right by their location on my way
home and I plan to pick up my tickets on Thursday evening.  Would you like
me to pick up your tickets also?  If so, do you want all three?  I remember
Marc saying that Anita was not sure if she would be attending.  I still
don't know if Shelley and Alina are going either, but I think they may.
Also, I was going to offer the four Enron tickets to Terrell Hemphill and

446,"I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow."

before effective date, customer can go DA without limitation
existing DA can stay DA
after effective date, customer can go DA upon payment of exit fee based on 
DWR's unavoidable costs
after effective date, customer can go DA w/o exit fee if using self-gen or 
cogen and with 180 days advance notice
re-entry fee applies for return to bundled service from DA, unless 12 months 
advance notice is given

establishes 6.5 cent ceiling price for SDGE large customers
ceiling effective Feb 7 through end of PG&E/SCE rate freeze
commission may adjust the ceiling, if in the public interest

The San Diego language has been coupled with other language concerning QF 
payment (and bond issuance).  This should further delay any action.

We should have more information from Sandi McCubbin on the progress of both 
of these bills Friday."

I will start copying you on the California updates.  The information comes

 "
451,"Is there any way that this group of people (and other people who may want to 
participate) can begin to have weekly conference calls to keep everyone fully 
in the loop on what is happening and needs to happen going forward related to 
wholesale activities - gas & power?

When things settle down (will that ever happen?), maybe weekly calls won't be 
necessary.  But given the pace and intensity of matters, we should try and 
coordinate through a 30 minute call.  I suggest Friday afternoon (3pm 
Houston) - that should give us the ability to make sure the right RCRs are 
submitted for discussion Monday am.

Also, Sue Mara has been keeping a catalog of activities on Power Wholesale 
matters.  (1) Sue can you please send it out to all of these people, (2) Sue. 
should we let the DC team - Ray and Donna - keep the catalog to make sure 
that we are organized before FERC?  Appreciate your thoughts.

Let me know.  I'll ask Marcia to try and put this together for this Friday 
and going forward.

452,"California Generators' Shares Tumble on Bankruptcy (Update1)
Bloomberg, 04/06/2001

Bear Stearns's Kevin Boone on Pacific Gas & Electric: Comment
Bloomberg, 04/06/2001


California Generators' Shares Tumble on Bankruptcy (Update1)

    (Adds Enron comment and updates share prices. For more on the
California electricity crisis, see {EXTRA <GO>}.)

     Houston, April 6 (Bloomberg) -- Shares of California power-
sellers Mirant Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and Dynegy Inc. fell more
than 9 percent after Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the state's
largest utility, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
     ``The concern with the generators is clearly that they're not
going to get paid anywhere near (the price) they sold power for to
the California grid,'' said David Schanzer, a Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC analyst.
     Shares of Atlanta-based Mirant, which owns California plants
able to produce enough power to light 3 million homes, fell as
much as 10 percent to $27.70 earlier. The stock was down 94 cents
at $29.96 in late trading.
     Charlotte-based Duke, which produces 3,000 megawatts, or
about 5 percent of the state's power, fell $2.20 to $40.20 after
reaching $38.44, down 9.3 percent. A megawatt is enough to light
1,000 typical U.S. homes.
     Houston-based Dynegy, which controls 2,800 megawatts of power
in a partnership with NRG Energy Inc. of Minneapolis, fell $3.11
to $47.81 after falling as much as 9.7 percent to $46. NRG Energy
shares fell $1.50 to $29.90.
     Calpine Corp., a San Jose, California-based generator and
power-plant developer, fell $5.04, or 9.9 percent, to $45.60.
Houston-based Reliant fell $1.85 to $43.50. Tulsa, Oklahoma-based
Williams Cos. fell $1.17 to $40.70.
     Enron Corp. of Houston, which sells power and natural gas in
California, fell $1.56 to $54.14. Enron's exposure to Pacific Gas
& Electric ``will not have any material effect on earnings or our
financial condition,'' Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said. Enron is
the world's biggest energy trader.
     Pacific Gas & Electric, owned by San Francisco-based PG&E
Corp., and Edison International's Southern California Edison, the
state's second-largest utility, together have losses of more than
$14 billion because they paid more for electricity than state
regulators allowed them to charge consumers.
    Shares of PG&E fell $4.31, or 38 percent, to $7.07. Trading
was halted earlier before the bankruptcy announcement. Edison fell
$4.49, or 36 percent, to $8.15. The company said it still expected
the state to work out a plan to end the energy crisis.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Master Trading Agreement 3.0

04/16/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

. By Michael Rieke 
. A Dow Jones Newswires Column . 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Carriers and trading companies worked for more than 
nine months last year, missed four deadlines and couldn't produce a master 
bandwidth trading agreement.
Now they seem to be coming out with something new every other month or so. 
Since mid-December, two master trading agreements have been posted on the 
Competitive Telecommunications Association Web site, and there's a third one 
circulating. Who's behind it, however, is a mystery. 
The first thing to understand in a discussion of master trading agreements 
for the bandwidth market is that few, if any, sources want to be quoted on 
the subject. 
Enron Corp. (ENE) and Williams Communications Group (WCG) are about the only 
companies willing to have their names attached to a trading contract. But 
it's safe to assume that at least El Paso Corp. (EPG), Utilicorp United Inc. 
(UCU) unit Aquila, Koch Industries and Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) worked with 
Enron on first contract. Universal Access Inc. (UAXS) and unnamed carriers 
are said to have worked with Williams on the second. 
The new contract is being referred to in the market as the ""Universal Access"" 
contract. 
""This is not a Universal Access contract,"" Pam Whitehead, vice president of 
global bandwidth markets for Universal Access, told Bandwidth Beat. Her 
company was one of about 10 carriers that worked on the third contract, she 
said. 
When asked for a copy of the third contract, Whitehead referred Bandwidth 
Beat to CompTel, saying she was sure the group had a copy. 
Another source, when asked for a copy of the third contract, said, ""Why don't 
you talk to Pam? It's her document."" Less Firm Or More Flexible? 

The third contract is ""less firm"" than the other two contracts, people in the 
trading market said. But a person who worked on it described it in a way that 
makes it sound more flexible than the other two. 
""It does have a check box on the front that allows you to totally opt out of 
the firmness that's described (in the contract), said the source. ""But if you 
don't check that box, it's completely firm."" 
Firm contracts leave parties liable for damages if the terms aren't met, and 
trading companies say bandwidth has to be traded on a firm basis for the 
market to work. Carriers, on the other hand, say the best-efforts basis on 
which they've always done business should be fine for bandwidth trading as 
well. 
This split has frustrated attempts to create a common contract. But the whole 
debate over firm versus best-efforts is at least a little bogus. 
Despite traders' hard-line position, there's always room for flexibility in 
markets. When Enron buys natural gas, it doesn't always use a firm contract. 
If it's going to resell the gas under an interruptible - or best-efforts - 
contract, it doesn't need to buy with a firm contract. 
In the winter, when delivery of gas is crucial, 95% of the business is done 
with firm contracts, a veteran gas trader told Bandwidth Beat. In the summer, 
when delivery isn't so crucial, 75% of the business is done with firm 
contracts. Special Deals No One Talks About 

When carriers say they've always done business on a best-efforts basis, 
they're not telling the whole truth either. Case in point are individual case 
basis, or ICB, contracts. 
ICB contracts aren't standardized. A buyer can get just about anything in an 
ICB deal, including firm delivery, but the buyer can't tell anyone about it. 
The arrangements are private and confidential. 
So who can get ICB contracts? It's determined by how much a buyer is 
spending, how much he knows about the market and how good he is at 
negotiating, Ron Harden, director and chief operating officer of PointOne 
Telecommunications in Austin, Texas, told Bandwidth Beat. 
""You can always get an ICB deal if you push them hard and ... if you know 
where the market is priced,"" he said. 
So energy traders don't always do business on a firm basis, and carriers 
don't always do business on a best-efforts basis. 
But there's no arguing that fact that trading with a firm contract makes any 
market, including the telecom market, more efficient. Buyers need to know 
when their crucial orders will be filled. 
Now let's go back to the fact that, at least on the carriers side of the 
argument, companies don't want their names associated with the effort to 
produce a standard trading agreement. 
The reluctance stems from internal and external concerns. Carriers' 
traditional sales staff fear bandwidth trading could cause them to lose 
customers and bonuses to their company's bandwidth trading desk. And carriers 
hoping to do business with both other carriers and trading companies don't 
want to endanger their relations with either group. 
But Jon Merriman, president and chief executive of RateXchange Corp. (RTX), 
has predicted that carriers won't always shy from being mentioned in 
connection with bandwidth trading. Sometime soon a telecom analyst will put a 
buy rating on a carrier that uses the bandwidth market to sell unused network 
capacity and increase its revenues, giving companies an incentive to open up, 
Merriman said. 
We'll see how long that takes.

Proposal to Alleviate California=01,s Electricity Shortage
Through Incentives to Reduce Demand

Objective
=06=15 Provide consumers with financial incentives to reduce demand in=20
anticipation of Summer 2001 electricity demand

Proposal
=06=15 The California PUC should require the utilities to immediately condu=
ct=20
on-line auctions for demand reductions totaling at least 2,000 MWs
=06=15 Alternatively, DWR could run the auction and implement the buy-down=
=20
program.  However, if it is determined that DWR requires additional authori=
ty=20
to execute the auction, the State should avoid any further delays and direc=
t=20
the CPUC to order the utilities to implement the buy-down program immediate=
ly.

The Auction Process (assuming the utilities implement the program)
=06=15 Businesses and large consumers willing to commit to sustained reduct=
ions=20
through November 1, 2001 would submit bids indicating the price they would =
be=20
willing to receive for a given quantity of permanent reduction=20
=06=15 If the =01&supply=018 of available reductions offered in the auction=
 exceeds=20
2,000 MWs, the utility should accept them, or explain to the Commission why=
=20
they chose not to accept them=20
=06=15 Businesses should be permitted to include in their bids the continue=
d=20
payment of wages to compensate employees for hours of employment foregone d=
ue=20
to demand reductions

A Single Price Approach
=06=15 A single price approach to a demand buy down program has two key=20
disadvantages:
=06=15 First, customers who would be willing to reduce demand for a lesser =
price=20
will be overpaid, much in the same way the single price auction in the PC=
=20
overpaid lower cost generators.  The state would overpay for reduced demand=
=20
under the single price approach.
=06=15 Second, the single price may not attract sufficient demand reduction=
s.
=06=15 Further, the single price approach does not provide greater certaint=
y=20
regarding the cost of demand reductions.  By conducting an auction the stat=
e=20
will be able to observe all bids and pay on an as bid basis, starting with=
=20
the lowest bids necessary to provide the required demand reductions up to t=
he=20
cost the state is willing to pay.
=06=15 A single price approach, however, could work if targeted at customer=
s who=20
would not participate in an auction, i.e. residential customers.  A well=20
publicized program of rebates to residential customers who use less than la=
st=20

single price could be structured in a complimentary fashion.
=06=15 The costs of the incentive program should be paid for by all consume=

since all consumers will benefit from the decreased risk of service=20

=06=15 If DWR implements the program, DWR=01, would recover its costs throu=

similar to the cost recovery mechanism used to recover power purchase costs=

=06=15 If the utilities implement the program, the California PUC would inc=

program costs in rates collected from customers
=06=15 The auction should be conducted online which will increase transpare=

Hazards to Avoid
=06=15 Avoid allowing lengthy utility and/or PUC review to delay implementa=
tion of=20
the reductions
_ Any unnecessary delay increases the chance that California will fail to=
=20
achieve the reductions needed to help avoid severe shortages in Summer 2001
_ There are numerous firms offering moderately-priced on-line auction=20
services that can quickly provide auction services to the utility
_ The utility should immediately contract for on-line services and present=
=20
the contract to the California PUC for prompt approval
_ The utilities should also include in their submittal to the PUC a simple,=
=20
streamlined set of pre-qualification criteria that would apply to bidders
_ The pre-qualification criteria should be designed with the goal of making=
=20
participation as easy and expansive as possible
_ Pre-qualification will encourage legitimate offers and reduce transaction=
=20
time
_ Once the PUC has approved the auction process, the PUC should not apply a=
ny=20
additional review to the auction results
_ Auction =01&pre-approval=018 will ensure that the utilities are actively =
and=20
constructively engaged

Actions
=06=15 Governor=01,s office directs PUC to initiate auction and residential=

=06=15 CPUC directs utility to submit auction proposal within 30 days

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail
By Daniel Taub 
Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray 
Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity 
market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a 
misdirected e-mail. 
The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was 
intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve 
Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press 
list, he said. 
Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would 
compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a 
state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and 
confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is 
buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt. 
``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a 
meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail 
contained minutes of today's meeting, he said. 
According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of 
electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough 
electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged 
from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the 
e-mail is accurate. 
Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a 
megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to 
Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot 
market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher 
than on the day-ahead market. 
The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a 
quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each 
season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law 
requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.

Dan's an excellent regulatory lawyer.
Dan worked for many years at SoCalGas before going into private practice.
Drew, I'll leave to you and Dan to work out the details of any contract for 
Dan's services.
Dan will need immediately:
A copy of Steve's testimony.
A copy of the PUC Rulemaking, etc. calling for testimony.
Any information on the list of parties who have indicated that they will 
cross Steve and for how long, and any testimony filed by those parties.
In addition, I would recommend strongly that Dan and Steve (at a minimum) get 
on the phone and discuss Steve's testimony tomorrow, and plan to meet prior 
to the hearing on Wednesday.  If you'd like me to participate in a call 
tomorrow, just let me know.

519," OK this has started out as one heck of a day, but first here's my draft.

Now the competitive section needs to be beefed up.  Sama: I did not have an 
electronic copy of the grid we worked on, and it didn't make sense to call 
you at 2.00 a.m. in the morning.

Versata's e-mail is very erratic right now, from dealing with clones of the 
Love virus.

I got stuck for 45 minutes in BART this morning, just before we pulled into 
19th street, Oakland.

Things to do:

1. Sama, we need to merge our sections
2. Sama, can you send me the competitive grid. I'll see if I can work that in 
before class, if not it'll have to be done either during or after class 
tonight.
3. Exec summary of our section
4. My stuff is 4 pages single spaced right now, and some of the competitive 
stuff has yet to get in.  Add to that the three scenarios we did (and the 
additions from yesterday), that makes another 3 pages, plus the SWOT makes 
another 4? We have some serious precis writing to do.

Later...

520,"From discussions with PACAF, USARAK and the NAVFAC Contracting Officers, we 
are aware of the following procurements that are intended to be released as a 
multi-base effort with a single solicitation.  This supersedes my last 
transmission on this subject, because the Navy has just released a new RFI 
for a grouped series of bases in California.

 1.  Navy, Southwest. 

  a.  Pt Huneme/Pt Mugu were intended as the first procurement on a bundled 
basis, but they are on hold awaiting funding for Phase 2.  They need to do 
life cycle cost analysis,  system condition assessment, and inventory.  A 
draft RFP will be issued to industry for comment.  The final RFP, 
optimistically (according to the NAVFAC SWDiv Commander) could be out as 
early as this quarter.  Doug Powell, the Contracting Officer, says a more 
realistic date is April-May of 2000.  However, Ralph Torres, the NAVFAC 
Business Line Manager for this procurement, is attending a PACFLT meeting 
this month in Hawaii to try to hurry this up. 
  b.  A new RFI has just hit the street, due 15 Nov 99, for electrical, gas, 
water, and wastewater privatization at 5 USN locations in Southern 
California.  These are Naval Warfare Assessment Station, Corona, CA; Naval 
Air Station, Fallon, NV; Naval Air Station, Lemoore, CA; Naval Weapons 
Station, Seal Beach, CA (Main Station); and Naval Weapons Station, Seal 
Beach, CA (Detachment Fallbrook).    

 2.  Marines,Southwest.  

  a.  NAVFAC intends to combine 29 Palms, MCLB Barstow, MCAS Yuma and MCRD 
San Diego into one procurement.  We have responded to the RFI, as we have in 
the case of the Navy, 1.a, above.  NAVFAC has has funding for Phase 2 for 
Barstow and 29 Palms, but not for the other two yet.  The RFP is expected to 
hit the street in the April-May, 2000 time frame.

  b.  NAVFAC intends to combine Camp Pendleton, a large base in CA, with a 
small base used for mountain warfare training at Bridgeport, CA.  The 
combination is being made for funding lines and chain of command reasons.  
The real plum here is the very large Marine base at Pendleton.  The RFP  is 
currently scheduled for release April, 2000, but we think it will be a few 
months later to have the above 4-base procurement hit the street first.

 3.  Navy, Northwest.  NAVFAC intends to release virtually all their 
Northwest activities in a single solicitation.  This includes the following 
locations:

  -Naval Subase bangor
  -Camp Wesley Harris
  -Olalla Housing
  -Port Hadlock
  -Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport
  -Naval Station Bremerton
  -Naval Hospital Bremerton
  -Jackson Park Naval Houising
  -Naval Fuel Depot Manchester
  -Naval Station Everett
  -Naval Radio Station Jim Creek
  -MWR Pacific Beach
  -Naval Air Station Whidbey Island
  
EFSI was invited to present at their Industry forum in Seattle where this 
procurement was announced on 4 Aug 99.  An  RFI is out, with response due 15 
Nov 99.  The final RFP is scheduled to be released in Jan 01.

 4.  Joint Regional Privatization Project (JRUPP) Alaska.  This is an 
agreement with the USAF and the US Army to combine their facilities at 
Elmendorf AFB, Kulis ANG Base, the Army National Guard Base, and Ft 
Richardson all into a single procurement.  DESC is the project manager.  An 
RFI for these locations just hit the street.  Our retired friend, USAF COL 
Don Michael Bradford instigated this joint procurement, and is still a good 
source of information in the Pacific.  Procurement is being accelerated with 
the USAF catching up to where the Army is, so schedule for an RFP is 
currently unknown.  USAF RFIs have just been published.

"
524,"Brian,
It is my understanding that the ISO has the right to get flat rate, (no 
mileage charge) access into the ISO network from within the LATA of the A 
POPs.  If this access is at the right price it means that any customer 
wanting to get a circuit between say, Redding CA and Orange County, CA would 
have VERY cheap access and competitive Long Haul.  That being said, at this 
point I do not think the A POP information is crucial to our initial meeting.

We need to ascertain the following:
1) Can the ISO nail up discreet circuits on this network?  It is currently a 
meshed ATM backbone with traffic being routed dynamically.  
2) What conditions need to be met by the ISO to scale the network to OC48?  
If they cannot scale it we have only about an OC3 of available bandwidth and 
that is not worth our time.
3) What are the DS3 and OC3/12 access rated from MCI?  This will uncover our 
true opportunity in this deal.

"
525,"Greetings:

Due to scheduling conflicts and in the attempt not to waste anyone's time, 
we'll try to conduct some preliminary due diligence via email, voicemail, 
etc.  I've asked GP to get us their audited financial statements for purposes 
of credit check.  Here is some additional information about the project.  If 
any questions come to mind based on this info, please let me know and we can 
forward along to GP for answers.  At this point we have tentatively scheduled 
a meeting with GP's CEO in the S.F. office for Tuesday, June 27th at 10 AM 
(PDT).

A Little Background:
Plan to construct an undersea fiber optic (24 fiber) cable linking several of 
California's major coastal cities (San Diego, L.A., Santa Barbara, San Luis 
Obispo, Monterey, S.F.). Will use a ""festooned"" arrangement (i.e., exit sea 
at each city point).  Total undersea length is ~900 km.
At each coastal city, they'll have a POP to connect to PSTN.
At San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach, they will deploy two, 
separate diverse cable routes from sea to POP.
Will deploy DWDM.
Plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-Pacific 
systems.
In addition to ""loops"" created in SLO, SB and Manhattan Beach, plan includes 
a terrestial leg from S.F. to Monterey to create a land/sea loop between SF 
and Monterey.
Total terrestial piece is ~400 km (which includes S.F. to Monterey terrestial 
leg).
Eventually, they'd like to secure terrestial leg from Monterey to San Diego 
to create a complete loop.
Has received environmental permit from State Lands Commission; CLEC 
certification from California PUC; and is awaiting environmental permit from 
Coastal Commission.
Expect to have southern portion of system (San Diego to San Luis Obispo) 
built and lit by end of Q1 2001.  
Northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with 
federal wildlife preserve off of Monterey.  May end up bypassing Monterey 
altogether.
The people behind the build are techno-philes; they admit to being ""clueless"" 
when it comes to marketing the capacity.
Due to Tyco's perceived lack of performance, Tyco is out and Alcatel is in 
(per Ethan's emails).
They are distressed.  Deutschbank has $8MM in the deal and is pushing on them.
Willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount.

Best,
Jeff"

Comments to Davis regarding some Speculated Solutions 1)

State could build generation:
The real issue is not who builds but that generation gets built in=20
California.=20
Any generation that is built in California will reduce problems because it=

will displace load.  Displace load will cause lower demand which in turn wi=
ll=20
result in lower market prices (new supply/demand balance).
Our proposal, RFP of 10,000 MW, will allow all kinds of proposals including=

ownership by government, to explore.
It is okay for the government to build generation but it should not result =
in=20
any different outcome than anyone else building.

Output of existing generation at cost
Output of existing utility generation should be sold at cost.
Utilities that caused the mess should not benefit.
All customers, including those being served by other suppliers,  paid for=

these utilities when they were below market.  They should get their share o=
f=20
benefits of the existing assets now at cost.

Municipal utilities could be required to sell their excess generation in=20
California.
The problem we are incurring are related to government intervention (i.e.=
=20
price caps and illiquidity) causing uncertainty that causes California=20
utilities to desire to sell outside of the state.
Removal of price caps will keep municipal generation in the state.
There is no need to mandate that it stay within California.

State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more=

widely deploy distributed generation.
This solution is a great idea which is included in our pitch.
As indicated, we are advocating a CPUC process of RFP=01,s that would inclu=

universities.
This is a superior method because universities are slow to act and we need=

solution by summer.


Expand in-state gas production.
No comment on this specific solution.  However, Enron notes that the QF=01,=

AFFILIATE
OHIO
Wireless companies violated separate affiliate requirements

The Public Utilities Commission has determined that Ameritech Mobile and
AirTouch Cellular violated state law by failing to maintain separate
cellular wholesale and retail operations.  The PUC's order addresses a
complaint filed in 1993 by Westside Cellular, Inc., dba Cellnet.

The PUC pointed to the testimony of Alan Ferber, general manager of
Ameritech Mobile's wholesale operations.  He acknowledged that Ameritech
Mobile's operations aren't structured as required by the PUC for sales
and marketing.  From that statement, the PUC concluded that Ameritech
Mobile wasn't separating its wholesale and retail operations ""in the
normal course of business.""

The PUC also found that Ameritech Mobile's practice of establishing
wholesale rates for nonaffiliated carriers by first consulting with its
retail employees about the potential impact on its retail business in
violation of the commission's orders in dockets 84-944 and 89-563.

Between 1995 and 1998, the commission said, Ameritech Mobile violated
the PUC's requirement for nondiscriminatory treatment of nonaffiliated
wholesale customers.  The company either didn't substantiate the more
favorable treatment afforded to its retail affiliate or didn't
substantiate that its retail affiliate paid anything at all to Ameritech
Mobile's wholesale cellular service, the commission concluded.

The commission found that AirTouch Cellular violated a prohibition on
its retail affiliate having any involvement in the operations of its
wholesale affiliate between 1991 and 1998.  During that period, AirTouch
Cellular's nonaffiliated wholesale rate was at least determined
partially by concerns related to the affiliated retail arm, the
commission said.

Based on AirTouch Cellular's own admission, the PUC found that the
company violated the provisions of the commission's orders in docket
nos. 84-944 and 89-563.  The commission found that AirTouch Cellular
failed to capture all billable minutes that should have been charged to
AirTouch Cellular's retail arm, while charging Cellnet for all of its
minutes.

The PUC found that imposing statutory penalties against the companies
isn't warranted in this case because it's a ""case of first impression.""

The commission's order is available at
http://www.puc.state.oh.us/docket/ORDERS/2001/0114/93-1758.pdf.  (Docket
no. 93-1758-RC-CSS)


SECTION 251/252
MINNESOTA
Qwest to refile controversial SGAT

Qwest Corp. asked the Public Utilities Commission to pull off the agenda
for yesterday's commission meeting its proposed statement of generally
available terms and conditions (SGAT), the PUC staff told TR.  The
company filed its original SGAT in November 2000, but the proposal
generated a lot of discussion because its prices differed from those set
by the PUC.  Staff said it expects Qwest to refile the SGAT ""relatively
soon.""  (Docket no. P-421/M-00-1590)


WIRELESS
ARIZONA
Ban on drivers' use of handheld cellphones dies in committee

A bill that would have banned the use of handheld wireless phones,
personal computers, or any other electronic device while driving died in
the Senate Commerce Committee, the legislative staff has told TR.
(1/9/01 a.m.)  The staff said SB 1005, which was sponsored by Sen. Tom
Smith (R., District 26), received ""tremendous"" opposition from the
wireless phone industry.

Last year Smith introduced a similar bill that also died in the Senate.
That bill, unlike SB 1005, didn't include an exception for hands-free
devices.  (1/24/00 p.m.)

Violators who weren't involved in a car accident would have been subject
to a $50 civil penalty.  Violators involved in an accident would have
been subject to a $100 civil penalty.  The officer at the scene of an
accident would have had to report on the accident form whether an
electronic device was in use at the time of the accident.

The bill would have required wireless phone packaging to include the
warning: ""The use of a cellular telephone while operating a motor
vehicle has been known to be a cause of traffic accidents, and the use
of a handheld cellular telephone while operating a motor vehicle is
prohibited by law in the state of Arizona.""


FUTURE OF REGULATION
MISSISSIPPI
Sen. Carlton aims to pass UETA

Sen. Neely C. Carlton (D., District 22) has introduced SB 2678 to enact
the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA).  The bill aims to
facilitate e-commerce by giving electronic records and signatures the
same legal effect as their pen and paper counterparts.

In addition to enacting UETA, SB 2678 would repeal the sections of
Mississippi Code that make up the Digital Signature Act of 1997.

SB 2678 has been referred to the Senate Committee on Fees, Salaries, and
Administration.


MERGERS
MONTANA
PSC would gain authority over utility mergers under bill

A bill to grant the Public Service Commission authority over utility
mergers has been referred to the Senate Energy and Telecommunications
Committee.  Under SB 276, the commission would have the authority to
allocate some or all of the gain or profit of an acquisition to the
utility's ratepayers.

The bill would prohibit the commission from approving an acquisition or
transfer of a public utility unless, after notice and hearing, it finds
the (1) acquisition to be in the public interest, (2) the acquisition
won't diminish the utility's ability to provide adequate and reliable
service, (3) the costs of and rates for supply service wouldn't be
increased, and (4) the applicant has the financial ability to operate
and maintain the utility.

This bill would affect Montana Power Co. plan to sell its electric
distribution assets, the PSC staff explained to TR.  Currently the
commission only has implied authority over utility acquisitions or
transfers.  This bill would clarify that authority.

Sen. Ken Toole (D., District 27) is the measure's sponsor.


CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
OREGON
Lawmakers take aim at 'slamming'

A bill introduced in the House would prohibit ""slamming,"" or the
unauthorized switch of a customer's telecom service provider.  HB 2214
would make it illegal to combine an offer to provide local or long
distance telecom service with an offer to participate in a sweepstakes
or promotion involving a prize.

The bill, which was requested by Attorney General Hardy Myers (D.),
would prohibit using any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud with the
intent to change a subscriber's telecom provider.

HB 2214 would authorize the AG to impose a maximum civil penalty of
$25,000 for each violation of the Act.  The bill also would allow any
person who suffered a loss of money or property as a result of slamming
to recover actual damages or $200, whichever is greater.

HB 2214 awaits consideration in the House Smart Growth and Commerce
Committee.


CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
NEW JERSEY
Bill would establish no-call list

Assemblyman Kevin J. O'Toole (R., District 21) has introduced AB 3065 to
require telemarketers to identify themselves and their businesses or
organizations before asking for a telephone subscriber by name or
soliciting business from a telephone subscriber.

Violators of the proposed law would be subject to a civil penalty of up
to $1,000 for a first violation and up to $2,500 for each subsequent
violation.  The bill has been referred to the Telecommunications and
Utilities Committee.

The committee also is considering another telemarketing bill.  AB 3028,
sponsored by Assemblywoman Linda R. Greenstein (D., District 14), would
prohibit unsolicited telemarketing calls to telephone customers who
placed their names on a no-call list.  (12/13/00 a.m.)

AB 3065's text is available at
http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2000/Bills/a3500/3065_i1.htm.


WIRELESS
MINNESOTA
Legislation would restrict driving while using a mobile phone

The House Crime Prevention Committee is considering a bill to make it a
misdemeanor to use a mobile telephone while driving.  Rep. Mike Jaros
(D., District 7B) introduced HF 200 yesterday.


INTERNET
MISSOURI
Bill would limit minors' Internet access

Sen. Bill Kenney (R., District 8) has introduced a measure to prevent
minors from accessing pornographic content over the Internet on public
access computers.

SB 42 would require public schools that offer Internet access either to
install filtering software or to use an Internet service provider that
filters content.  Public libraries either could purchase filtering
software or create a policy to define ""community standards"" of material
that is ""pornographic for minors"" and restrict access to such content.

School and library employees who failed to comply with SB 42 could be
charged with a misdemeanor, while employees who complied with the law
wouldn't be held liable for minors' obtaining pornographic material on a
public access computer.

The Senate Education Committee held a hearing Jan. 17 on the
legislation.  Although it hasn't passed out of the committee yet, it's
expected to do so, a legislative staff member told TR.

During the hearing, the Missouri Library Association agreed to support
SB 42 if an amendment were added to state specifically that ""public
library personnel"" who comply with the bill couldn't be held liable for
minors' accessing pornographic content on public access computers.  The
amendment met with no opposition, the staff member said.


INTERCOMPANY COMPENSATION
VIRGINIA
SCC requests comment on $20.5 million Sprint access rate settlement

The State Corporation Commission has requested comments by Feb. 1 on an
access rate settlement between the SCC staff and Sprint Corp.'s
incumbent local exchange companies--United Telephone-Southeast, Inc.,
and Central Telephone Co. of Virginia.

The settlement would result in a $20.5 million cumulative reduction in
the Sprint companies' intrastate switched access rates over three
years.  (1/9/01 a.m.)  AT&T Corp. has promised to pass the savings
through to its long distance customers.

The SCC said it will hold a hearing March 20 if one is requested.

In December 2000 the commission approved similar access rate settlements
with Verizon Virginia, Inc. (formerly Bell Atlantic-Virginia, Inc.) and
Verizon South, Inc. (formerly GTE South, Inc.).  The two Sprint
companies are the only incumbent carriers remaining in the commission's
original investigation.  (Case no. PUC000003, Investigation of the

this e-mail didn't appear to reach you last night, so re-sending

Jeff
I enjoyed seeing you again at the meeting earlier today.  I am not sure how
much of my background you might recall.  But I have spent much of my career
advising senior politicians, and more recently (past 6 years or so) leading
industry processes to influence policy outcomes and implement industry lead
reform.  Like you I find the issues the issues these processes through up
exciting and challenging.  Clearly, the scale of industry and political
administration is greater than NZ and Australia (with a combined population
of about 20m), but some of our experience in thinking through and managing
these processes to achieve useful outcomes might be useful.
Please call me if you need to think out loud or if I can help in anyway.  I
have attached my cv to give you an indication of the sort of issues and
processes with which I have been involved.  I am currently on a plane back
to NZ tomorrow (Sunday) night, but am up and down reasonably frequently.
My contact numbers are wk (64 4) 472 0590, mobile (64 21) 245 0161 (I have

540,"Rob had Robert Michaels give me a ring re: potential panelist at the field 
hearing.  Be happy to pitch him to Ms Van Way.  Thoughts?"
541,"The speaker introduced a bill that would:

Order the CA PUC to establish a ""rate component"" to permit the utilities to 
recover its ""net undercollected amount"" over a period of ten years.  (Sounds 
like there may be a haircut in there somewhere.)
Authorize the State Water Dept. to purchase power on behalf of utilities and 
munis.
Order the CA PUC to create a separate rate component to cover the Dept.'s 
cost of purchasing the power.
Authorize the Treasurer to issue debt, backed by ratepayers, to cover any 
difference between the price the Water Dept. buys the power for and the price 
that can be collected from ratepayers under the rate freeze.
Authorizes the State Director of Finance to ""accept on behalf of the state 
any tangible asset of an electrical corporation.""  (Presumably the state is 
looking to get something from the IOUs (say, the hydro assets) in exchange 
for giving the utility it's ""net undercollected amount.""

The bill is long and haven't yet had a chance to review it in detail.  We're 
faxing the bill.

The bill will be controversial and it is unclear who in the Legislature has 
bought into it, though the Governor signaled his general support for this 
sort of approach in a press conference last night announcing the results of 
the power auction. 

The Assembly is scheduled to have a hearing on the bill later today.

2. GA meeting w/ Business People

A few of us could go to Belden, Calger, Yang, Benevides, Condon to discuss

FUTURE OF REGULATION
ILLINOIS
Legislation to rewrite telecom law introduced

Several legislators yesterday introduced HB 492/SB 134 to rewrite the
telecom article of the state's Public Utilities Act, which expires July
1.  Connect Illinois, an advocacy group that counts Ameritech-Illinois
as one of its members, joined the legislators in a news conference
yesterday announcing the bill.

The major objectives of the legislation are to (1) guarantee consumers
that prices for basic residential service always remain affordable, (2)
allow the marketplace to increase competitive choices for business and
broadband services, (3) give concise legislative direction to the future
role of the state Commerce Commission, (4) modernize ICC communications
rules to permit them access to the latest information, (5) require
network unbundling for all carriers and cable ""open access,"" and (6)
create an atmosphere that encourages technological investment and
deployment.

The bill would establish a two-year rate freeze, with future increases
capped below the rate of inflation.  It also would deregulate optional
services, such as call waiting and Caller ID.

The sponsors of SB 134 are Sens. Steve Rauschenberger (R., Elgin) and
Denny Jacobs (D., East Moline).  Reps. Steve Davis (D., Bethalto) and
Art Tenhouse (R., Liberty) sponsored HB 492.

Rep. Calvin K.Y. Say (D., District 18) has introduced HB 1180, which
would amend the state franchise tax to include telephone, telecom, and
cable TV businesses.  Those businesses would have to pay 2.5% of their

HB 1180 awaits consideration by the House Consumer Protection and
Commerce Committee and the House Finance Committee.

STATE & LOCAL GOVERNMENT
MICHIGAN
Group begins work on telecom plan

The Michigan Economic Development Corp. (MEDC) has begun gathering
information to develop a telecommunications plan for the state, a
corporation representative told TR.   MEDC is quasi-governmental agency.

The MEDC's executive committee directed the corporation to begin work on
the plan to learn how Michigan can develop its telecom industry and
infrastructure.  The executive committee didn't set any timeframe for
when it would like the plan completed, the representative said.

The MEDC is in the very early stages of developing the plan and hasn't
defined specifically what issues it will address yet.  Mostly, the group
is gathering information about what other states are doing in this area,
the representative explained.

NETWORK MANAGEMENT
PENNSYLVANIA
Carrier fined $50,000 for failing to post surcharge notice on pay phones

One Call Communications Inc., d/b/a Opticom, has agreed to pay a $50,000
civil penalty for failing to post notice of a surcharge it had been
assessing on intrastate calls made from pay phones.  Public Utility
Commission regulations require notice of such surcharges to be posted in
plain view on the pay phone.

The commission said its prosecutory staff confirmed reports of the
violations during an informal investigation.  The company said it was
unaware of the posting requirement.  The PUC said local exchange
carriers (LECs) own some of the pay phones served by Opticom and won't
let the company place stickers on the phones.

According to the staff, Opticom immediately posted notification stickers
where it could and ceased assessing the surcharge on calls made from LEC
pay phones on which it couldn't post stickers.

The commission said the $50,000 fine, which the company agreed to in a
proposed settlement with staff, was sufficient given the company's
cooperation during the investigation.  The PUC tentatively has agreed to
adopt the settlement.  It asked for comments on the settlement by Feb.
13.  (Docket no. M-00011449 Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission v.
Opticom Division of One Call Communications)

CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
KANSAS
Bill would prohibit 'slamming'

The House Committee on Utilities has recommended the passage of a bill
that would prohibit changing or adding to a customer's telecom services
without authorization.  HB 2099 would prohibit carriers from directing a
local exchange carrier to change a subscriber's carrier without
obtaining the subscriber's permission beforehand.  Carriers requesting
such a change would be responsible for proving through a ""preponderance
of the evidence"" that the consumer authorized the transaction.

HB 2009 also would prohibit providers from engaging in any activity that
could mislead the subscriber while soliciting or confirming a carrier
change.  In addition, the bill would prohibit the use of sweepstakes
entries as a form of authorization to switch a consumer's carrier or add
supplemental services to the consumer's account.

Violations of HB 2009 would be punishable by civil penalties of between
$5,000 and $20,000 per offense.  Individuals could bring a private
action against any party they believed had violated HB 2009.

Sen. Carona aims to enact UETA

Sen. John J. Carona (R., District 16) has introduced SB 393 to enact the
Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which would make electronic
signatures and records legally equivalent to traditional signatures and
records.  The bill wouldn't require the use of electronic records and
signatures but would uphold their use when both parties involved in a
transaction agreed to conduct business electronically.

SB 393 also wouldn't preempt requirements in other laws regarding the
posting of a record.  In addition, electronic records wouldn't be
enforceable if the sender prevented the recipient from storing or
printing them.  The Department of Information Resources would specify
the manner in which state agencies could use electronic records.

SB 393 has been referred to the Senate Business and Commerce Committee.

statewide cable TV access infrastructure plan that would aim to
distribute more equally the costs associated with public, educational,
or government cable TV channels.  The plan could include establishing a
statewide fund from cable TV franchise fees to provide funds for the
needs of the cable TV access infrastructure.

SB 1536 awaits consideration by the Senate Economic Development and
Technology Committee and the Senate Ways and Means Committee.

SECTION 251/252
TEXAS
PUC to hear Supra complaint against SW Bell

The Public Utility Commission has scheduled an April 9 hearing to
consider the merits of a case filed by Supra Telecommunications and
Information Systems, Inc., against Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.
(7/20/00 p.m.)  Supra filed the complaint because SW Bell denied Supra's
request to collocate a Lucent Technologies, Inc., host switch in SW
Bell's Dallas Taylor central office.

SW Bell says it denied Supra's request because the FCC's advanced
service order and section 51.323 rule don't require incumbent local
exchange carriers to collocate equipment that will be used ""solely for
switching purposes.""  (Docket no. 22797 - Complaint and Request for
Expedited Relief and Interim Ruling of Supra Telecommunications and
Information Systems, Inc., Against Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. and
for Resolution of Dispute)

NETWORK MANAGEMENT
NEW YORK
Bill would exempt coin calls from excise tax

Sen. James W. Wright (R., District 46) has introduced SB 1086 to exempt
coin-sent-paid calls from the state's 2.5% telecom excise tax.  Other
calls made from pay phones wouldn't be exempt.

Sen. Wright's staff said the revenue generated by coin calls is minimal
and likely exceeds the cost of administering the tax.  The staff also
found that the majority of pay phone providers are small businesses, and
their cost of calculating, collecting, and accounting for the tax is a
""substantial burden.""

The bill has been assigned to the Committee on Energy and
Telecommunications.

NETWORK MANAGEMENT
IDAHO
PUC holds off on area code public hearings

The Public Utilities Commission has decided to wait until late spring to
hold public hearings on a possible new area code in Idaho.  ""By late
May, the new forecast will give us a better indication of when Idaho
will run out of phone numbers for the '208' area code.  With that
information, we can better set the timetable needed to get public input
on how best to put the new area code in service,"" the commission said.

The commission staff told TR that North American Number Planning
administrator NeuStar, Inc., plans to issue a revised forecast for the
208 area code in May.  Earlier projections said the state would need a
new area code in the first quarter 2003.  The staff said requests for
new telephone numbers have slowed down, which could delay the need to
implement a new area code.

HAWAII
Lawmakers examine electronic forgery

Rep. Eric Hamakawa (D., District 3) has introduced a bill to extend the
offense of forgery in the second degree to include the unlawful use of
the signature device of another individual to create an electronic
signature of that person.  HB 154 would add the offense to the state's
Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

HB 154 awaits consideration by the Consumer Protection and Commerce
Committee and the Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs Committee.

547,"Here are my first thoughts on this:

If we are to agree to exit fees, which I think we obviously have to to be 
credible.  The definition of, ""...costs imposed on the portfolio that are 
directly related to the load of the departing customer,""  should be the value 
of portfolio costs (including generation at embedded costs, QFs at cost, 
contracts, etc.) compared to market.  The LD cannot be just based on the 
liquidation of contract costs, or we don't get the benefit of embedded 
generation value (which today would liquidate as a credit).  This may bite us 
if market costs drop below embedded generation, but we are out of business 
now if we don't get it.  Also, if we don't get the market liquidation value 
of embedded generation then the portfolio gets, all else equal, a lower cost 
resulting from the departing load - not fair or equitable.

Industry observers also talked up the prices paid for three 10- megahertz=

Alaska Native Wireless LLC, which is 39.9%-owned by AT&T Wireless Services,=
=20
Inc., won the third New York City license with a $1.4 billion bid.

Verizon Wireless topped all bidding at the sale, which ended Jan. 26,=20
offering more than $8.7 billion for 113 licenses covering 150 million =0F""p=

(potential customers).

=0F""It is very interesting that the company with one of the strongest spect=

=20
Lehman Brothers, Inc., analyst John M. Bensche said in a note to investors=
=20
last week.  =0F""We commend Verizon for its boldness in the auction, where i=

Mr. Bensche noted that Verizon Wireless and its founding companies =0F""had =
been=20
quite conservative in their acquisition philosophy. . .This prior=20
conservatism makes the aggressive bidding all the more remarkable, and we=
=20
wonder how much of the =0F`new=0F' philosophy was transplanted into the ven=

Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications, Inc., and=20
Vodafone AirTouch plc.

=0F""Verizon, with its voracious appetite, was the clear upset victor,=0F"" s=

Michael I. Rollins, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.  He had=20
predicted before the auction that the carrier would bid $3 billion to $5=20
billion on licenses.

=0F""Although we understand that spectrum is an attractive resource, we were=
 a=20
bit surprised at how aggressive the company was relative to others in the=
=20
auctions,=0F"" Cynthia M. Motz, an analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston Co=
rp.,=20
agreed in a note to investors.  She had expected Verizon Wireless to bid le=
ss=20
than $1.3 billion in the reauction.

=0F""Based on their auction wins, we believe Verizon is unlikely to be an av=
id=20
participant in subsequent auctions,=0F"" including the 700 megahertz band sa=
le,=20
Ms. Motz added.

The FCC=0F's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau last week postponed the 700=
 MHz=20
band auction from March 6 to Sept. 12 (see separate story).

Verizon Wireless officials have declined to comment on the reauction result=
s,=20
citing the FCC=0F's anti-collusion rules.  But Dennis F. Strigl, the carrie=
r=0F's=20
president and chief executive officer, acknowledged at the Comnet Conferenc=
e=20
& Expo in Washington last week (see separate story) that the overall prices=
=20
paid at the sale were =0F""extremely high.=0F""

Analysts speculated why Verizon Wireless had agreed to pay so much for the=
=20
New York City spectrum.  It could be that the carrier wanted to ensure=20
dominance in the wireless data market, or to guarantee that competitors=0F-=
such=20
as Cingular Wireless LLC=0F-didn=0F't land the valuable frequencies, they t=
heorized.

Or perhaps Verizon Wireless is closer than analysts believe to being tapped=
=20
out regarding its available spectrum in New York, they speculated.

=0F""The company has been quite mum about exactly why it felt the need to bu=
lk up=20
so much,=0F"" Mr. Bensche said.  =0F""Of course, it will be incumbent upon ma=
nagement=20

(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) potential=
=20
around wireless data than they have been in the past as they seek to explai=
n=20
the $8.8 billion increase in the debt load.=0F""

Indeed, Credit Suisse First Boston last week downgraded Verizon=20
Communications=0F' stock from a strong buy to a buy, in part because of its=
 need=20
to raise cash to pay for the spectrum and the costs of building its wireles=
s=20
network.  The parent company has said it will lend the wireless unit the=20
money to pay for the licenses.  Standard & Poor=0F's revised its outlook on=
=20
Verizon Communications to stable from positive, citing the auction debt as=
=20
one reason.

Whatever Verizon Wireless=0F' reasons for snatching up the New York City=20
spectrum, analysts concede that licenses there are valuable for any carrier=
. =20
=0F""In order to provide nationwide coverage in the United States, New York =
is=20
mandatory,=0F"" noted Knox Bricken, an analyst at the Yankee Group.

Overall, Mr. Bensche said, the C and F block reauction proceeds equate to=
=20
$4.18 per =0F""megahertz pop,=0F"" just behind third-generation (3G) auctions=
 in the=20
United Kingdom ($4.29 per MHz pop) and Germany ($4.68 per MHz pop) last yea=
r,=20
which raised more than $80 billion (TR, May 1, and Aug. 21 and 28, 2000). =
=20
Verizon Wireless=0F' bidding worked out to $5.79 per MHz pop, Mr. Bensche s=
aid.

=0F""We believe that biding was rational, and that an average of $4.18/pop/M=
Hz=20
was a reasonable amount for carriers to pay for the spectrum available,=0F""=
 Mr.=20
Rollins said.

Analysts Scrutinize Other Strategies

Here=0F's a look at analysts=0F' take on how the other largest carriers did=
 at the=20
auction:

AT&T WIRELESS:  It didn=0F't win any licenses separately but will benefit f=
rom=20
those won by its =0F""designated entity=0F"" (DE), or small-business, partner=
 Alaska=20
Native Wireless, which bid $2.8 billion for 44 licenses.

Through that alliance, analysts note, AT&T Wireless gained spectrum in Los=
=20
Angeles and New York, bringing its holdings to 45 MHz in those markets.  It=
=20
also added licenses in other major markets.

AT&T Wireless told analysts last week that the additional spectrum would=20
allow it to roll out a 3G system in 16 additional markets.  In all, the=20
carrier says, it will be able to deploy the 3G universal mobile=20
telecommunications system (UMTS) technology in 88 of the top 100 markets.

In addition, Mr. Bensche noted that DE affiliates or subsidiaries of two=20
other carriers with close ties to AT&T Wireless=0F-Triton PCS Holdings, Inc=
.,=20
and Dobson Communications Corp.=0F-also won a total of 28 licenses at the=
=20
auction.

CINGULAR WIRELESS:  The carrier has 85% equity in DE Salmon PCS LLC, the=20
number-three bidder at the reauction with $2.3 billion in bids on 79=20
licenses.  Analysts say Salmon won licenses in a number of markets where=20
Cingular needs to fill in holes in its footprint, including Minneapolis;=20
Denver; Portland, Ore.; Norfolk, Va.; Pittsburgh; and Richmond, Va. =20

It also won licenses that could shore up Cingular=0F's spectrum position in=
=20
other key markets, including Los Angeles, Dallas, and Boston.

But it failed to win any spectrum in New York City=0F-a key market.  Cingul=
ar=20
already has a 10 MHz block of spectrum in the Big Apple, thanks to a swap o=
f=20
licenses with VoiceStream Wireless Corp. announced before the auction (TR,=
=20
Nov. 6, 2000).

Mr. Bensche said Cingular =0F""should be comfortable=0F"" with that block unt=
il it=20
can acquire more spectrum in New York City in the 700 MHz band auction.  He=
=20
called Cingular-backed Salmon=0F's decision not to remain in bidding for Ne=
w=20
York City spectrum =0F""an act of bravery on behalf of [Cingular] shareholde=
rs.=0F""

Ms. Motz also commended Cingular for its =0F""disciplined=0F"" bidding via Sa=
lmon.  =0F""
While the pressure was on for Cingular to win a New York license, it was no=
t=20
enough for the company to be pressured into paying more than it was willing=
,=0F""=20
she said. =20

Salmon officials have said they intend to use the licenses for their own=20
network, although they would have the right to use Cingular=0F's name and m=
ight=20
establish roaming and operations agreements with the large carrier.

VoiceStream:  A VoiceStream subsidiary, Voice-Stream PCS BTA, bid $482=20
million for 19 licenses.  Its DE affiliate, Cook Inlet/VS GSM V P, offered=
=20
$506 million for 22 licenses. =20

The companies filled important VoiceStream footprint holes in the Carolinas=
,=20
including Charlotte and Greensboro in North Carolina and Charleston and=20
Columbia in South Carolina, analysts said.

VoiceStream also picked up licenses in Texas, the Pacific Northwest, and th=
e=20
Midwest.  Its auction success, combined with its planned merger with=20
Powertel, Inc., and recent spectrum swap with Cingular, has helped it build=
 a=20
nationwide footprint, Mr. Bensche said.

Ms. Motz said Cingular=0F's and VoiceStream=0F's auction results =0F""could =
suggest=20
that the two intend to work closely together on favorable roaming=20
arrangements in the near future (since each has what the other needs alread=
y=20
built out).=0F""

SPRINT PCS:  SprintCom, Inc., a Sprint PCS subsidiary,  dropped out of the=
=20
reauction.  But SVC BidCo L.P., a DE that is 80%-owned by Sprint PCS, won=
=20
five licenses for $281 million.  The licenses are in areas where analysts s=
ay=20
Sprint PCS had only 10 MHz of spectrum=0F-Tampa and Orlando in Florida,=20
Cincinnati and Dayton in Ohio, and Norfolk, Va.

Analysts note that Sprint PCS also secured additional spectrum in a swap wi=
th=20
AT&T Wireless announced before the auction.  They say that because it has=
=20
such a strong spectrum position (30 MHz of spectrum in the majority of its=
=20
markets), they aren=0F't surprised it wasn=0F't more aggressive in the sale=
.

NEXTEL COMMUNICATIONS, INC.:  Nextel Spectrum Acquisition Corp., a Nextel=
=20
subsidiary, dropped out of the reauction when bidding got too high, as did=
=20
Connectbid LLC, a Nextel DE bidding partner controlled by cellular industry=
=20
pioneer Craig McCaw.  Analysts were not surprised.  They said the auction d=
id=20
not afford Nextel a chance to secure a full national footprint.

=0F""The prospect of holding only 10 MHz of PCS spectrum in a handful of mar=
kets=20
at high prices is not an ideal remedy to Nextel=0F's current spectrum need,=
=0F"" Mr.=20
Bensche said. =20

=0F""With an average of 16 MHz of spectrum in the 800 MHz band to operate it=
s=20
iDEN system, it would suit Nextel more to acquire a contiguous 10 MHz on a=
=20
nationwide basis rather than a piecemeal collection of properties,=0F""  he =
said.

Analysts expect Nextel to continue acquiring 800 MHz and 900 MHz band=20
spectrum and say it also could pursue licenses at the 700 MHz band auction.=
  =0F""
Whatever the strategy, the completion of the auction puts Nextel=0F's=20
competition in a much stronger position to better compete in both the voice=
=20
and data markets, leaving Nextel at a disadvantage for future services,=0F""=
 Mr.=20
Bensche said.

Meanwhile last week, Dana Frix, an attorney for San Antonio=0F-based Allegh=
eny=20
Communications, Inc., told TRthat company officials still were considering=
=20
their options for contesting the auction results.

Allegheny, which dropped out of the reauction before it was over when the=
=20
prices got too high, says the DE rules permitted large carriers to=20
participate through =0F""shell entities=0F"" for licenses reserved for=20
entrepreneurs.  Allegheny failed to persuade the U.S. Court of Appeals in=
=20
Washington to block the reauction the day before it began in December 2000=
=20
(TR, Dec. 18, 2000).

The 35 winning bidders in the reauction have until Feb. 12 to submit down=
=20
payments, the FCC said in a public notice released last week.  The bidders=
=20
also must submit their =0F""long-form=0F"" 601 applications, as well as form =
602,=20
which includes ownership information, by that date.  The FCC has said it=20
would review ownership arrangements of winning auction bidders closely befo=
re=20
granting licenses.

Of the 422 licenses on the block in the reauction, 170 were reserved for=20
qualified DEs and 252 were open to all bidders.  Mr. Bensche noted that the=
=20
liberal capitalization rules for DEs allowed large companies to jump back a=
nd=20
forth between bidding on =0F""open=0F"" and =0F""closed=0F"" licenses, using bi=
dding credits=20
for the open licenses through the DEs.

=0F""In reality, this drove up the prices in the closed blocks to the same l=
evels=20
as the open licenses being chased by the designated entities,=0F"" Mr. Bensc=
he=20
concluded.  =0F""In fact, analyzing all of the markets in which at the close=
 of=20
the auction one of the open licenses was won by a bidder with bidding=20
credits, we come to the conclusion that the closed blocks went for 9% more=
=20
than the open blocks!=0F""

Meanwhile, last week bankrupt NextWave Telecom, Inc., whose reclaimed=20
licenses were snatched up at the reauction, filed its reply brief with the=
=20
U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington in its case against the FCC.

In its brief, NextWave repeated its argument that the cancellation of its=

licenses was prohibited by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Oral arguments are=20

Bureau OKs Satellite Operators For Intersatellite Communications

The FCC=0F's International Bureau has modified the licenses of 10 operators=

them to operate intersatellite service links (ISLs) using that spectrum.

The bureau said that it could permit the operators to provide ISL services =

assigned the 65=0F-71 gigahertz band for ISL use by fixed satellite service=

Court Upholds FCC Rules Giving ILECs Road to Pricing Flexibility

A federal appeals court says it=0F's reasonable to use the number of carrie=
rs=20
collocating equipment in an incumbent=0F's wire centers as =0F""proxy=0F"" me=
asures for=20
determining the levels of local competition.  The FCC uses that proxy to=20

rejected WorldCom, Inc.=0F's argument that the FCC=0F's criteria for granti=
ng ILECs=20
pricing flexibility didn=0F't measure competition accurately and were unlaw=
fully=20
arbitrary.

The case centered on the FCC=0F's 1999 pricing-flexibility order in Common=
=20
Carrier docket 96-262.  The order allowed ILECs regulated under its price-c=
ap=20
regime to gain greater flexibility in setting rates for interstate services=
=20
if they met certain competitive =0F""triggers=0F"" (TR, Aug. 9, 1999).

For example, ILECs can win relief from some pricing rules if the FCC finds=
=20
that unaffiliated carriers have collocated facilities in a certain percenta=
ge=20
of the ILEC=0F's wire centers and that at least one collocator is=20
facilities-based.

In its Feb. 2 ruling in MCI WorldCom, Inc., et al. v. FCC (case no. 99-1395=

the court found that the FCC =0F""made a reasonable policy determination=0F""=
 that=20

551,"Hey! Everyone seems to miss a point I tried to make clear. The collaboration
I suggested is not with Haas. Don't mention that name! The collaboration is
with IBER and UEI, two research organizations that are not formally
connected with any school. Shapiro suggested that they could offer some
modest help with resources, and we have to figure out if it's worth asking
for any. Maybe if we are planning to keep the ""conference fees"" for GSPP
then it is better not to ask them for any money (and thus keep clear our
claim to any fees). Reactions?

555,"We just received a phone call from the House Energy and Commerce Committee 
Republican staff inviting Enron to meet in California on February 21 with 
Chairman Tauzin, Rep. Joe Barton, and other Republican committee members.  
The Committee intends to hold three meetings, probably in Pasadena, of a fact 
finding nature.  The meetings will be CEO level and will not be official 
hearings.  Instead, the meetings will be more in the nature of a roundtable 
session.  The three groups being invited are:  a)generators/marketers; b) 
IOUs; and c) State and consumer groups.  The Chairman is interested in 
hearing about solutions, and less interested in ""who's to blame.""    Other 
participants in our group are:  Dynegy, Southern, Reliant, Duke, Calpine, and 
Williams.  They intend to also include a few natural gas suppliers in our 
group.   Our session is expected to start at 10:00 a.m.  Although they are 
asking for CEO level participation, I expect we could substitute someone 
under that rank.  However, I would recommend we try to accommodate their 
request for CEO attendance given the meeting with be with Chairman Tauzin.  
Enron historically has not had close ties to the new Chairman."

What would PJM say in response?  What is their current thinking?  Also, given

SURVEY - DERIVATIVES - All bets on hold as market waits out crisis.

09/25/2001

The US crisis has created turmoil for the equity and bond markets but that is what derivatives thrive on. 
The financial markets have suffered a severe shock from the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on September 11. Everything that was being planned - from mergers and acquisitions to the launch of cutting-edge derivatives instruments - is now under review, cancelled or postponed.
The watchword now is risk. Already we have witnessed a big switch into the least risk-averse instruments - short-dated government bonds, for the most part. Yet derivatives markets should be beneficiaries of investor behaviour. By their nature they are creatures of risk, volatility and uncertainty. 
This year had been shaping up as a landmark year in the derivatives industry. The credit derivatives sector has seen the most spectacular growth, since credit risk has been rising in a weakening economic environment and protection against it was becoming a leading concern for investors and companies. 
The growth of the credit derivatives business has also proved a lure for insurance companies, looking to diversify their own risk portfolios outside their traditional business areas. 
One result of this, bankers say, was the prevalence of regulatory capital arbitrage deals, with banks, which are looking to utilise their own capital, happy to pass on chunks of their risk exposure to those such as insurance companies, seeking diversification. 
""The awareness of credit risk is very high in the corporate market,"" says a senior investment banker. ""That creates opportunities for insurance companies to come in and take on that risk. They are looking for a diversified portfolio of risk - property, casualty, credit, etc. They are pretty active, especially at the low-value, plain-vanilla end of the market."" 
Other investors are more interested in getting more yield on their portfolios. Given that before the terrorist attacks the outlook for interest rates was relatively favourable - that is to say that they were seen to be falling in both Europe and the US - yield investors were going outside their traditional areas of investment, in long-dated government bonds, in search of higher returns. The credit derivatives market is able to provide that. A bond issued by even a top-notch company is almost always going to yield less than a credit derivatives market product, according to fund managers. 
""There are huge capital markets volumes in the credit derivatives area,"" another banker says. ""We've seen an increase this year in over-the-counter market activity, and there has been a lot more issuance, since liquidity is a key factor in building the market."" 
There are three key factors to derivatives products - structuring and pricing, valuation, and risk management, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and settlement risk. As derivatives products became much more widely available, not just to sophisticated investors but to chief financial officers at companies, the industry has also been attracting the close attention of regulators. 
This is hardly surprising - the debate continues, for example, as to whether the use of credit derivatives by banks concentrates risk rather than dispersing it, which is what these instruments are supposed to do. 
Other developments this year have included the record growth in turnover in exchange-traded derivative products. Europe's two big exchanges, in Frankfurt and London, continued to slug it out for supremacy and have unveiled a wide range of new products to attract more volume and investors. 
The trading pits at the Chicago derivatives exchanges, meanwhile, have carried on echoing to the sound of thousands of traders, even though most of the rest of the world has moved completely into electronic trading. 
So, where are the markets heading? Some observers argue that the industry in Europe is in general more sophisticated and less commoditised than its US counterpart. This may be because it is of more recent development and banks have tended to specialise in over-the-counter solutions for clients rather than developing products that can be traded on an exchange. It has also been encouraged to spread by the advent of the euro, which has created a thriving cross-border business. 
Christophe Reech, chairman and chief executive of Reech Capital, a derivatives industry specialist, says the growth of the industry and its increased sophistication have a solid foundation. ""Traditional solutions (to risk managment) are not good enough any more,"" he says. ""You need to be a little bit creative. If you provide traditional solutions you solve the immediate problem but not the evolutionary one."" 
One of the fastest-growing niche areas is the provision of weather derivatives. Demand began among natural gas companies in the US looking to hedge their exposure to extreme weather. Now many companies are in the market, with the most basic products designed to hedge against unusual temperature movements. 
Much of this business is also tailor-made for clients, with risks managed through secondary market trading. According to Paul Murray, director of weather risk management at Enron, possibly the largest trader of weather derivatives contracts, the market is growing at 40 to 50 per cent by number of transactions. ""I'm pretty optimistic about the market - the weather isn't going to go away,"" he says. 
Whether the optimism that characterised much of this year will now evaporate in the wake of the terrorist attacks remains to be seen. With a new air of uncertainty gripping investors, and a sudden bout of risk aversion witnessed in the equity and bond markets in the aftermath of September 11, all bets are off. 
However, given that interest rates are certain to fall further - many analysts predict that the Federal Reserve will steadily lower US interest rates by at least another 50 basis points - yield enhancement and risk management are expected to continue to stay at the forefront of investor concerns. 
That could create the conditions for much more activity in both credit and equity derivatives. ""It's far too early to predict anything, but derivatives are designed to minimise and control risk,"" says a leading derivatives industry banker. ""I am pretty confident that there is a lot more growth to come in this industry.""

SURVEY - DERIVATIVES - Exchanges trading on an uncertain future - COMMODITY DERIVATIVES by Adrienne ...

SURVEY - DERIVATIVES - Exchanges trading on an uncertain future - COMMODITY DERIVATIVES by Adrienne Roberts - What will be the outcome of the rivalry between Nymex and London's IPE? The September 11 attack has added a brutal new twist to the ongoing contest. 
After the devastation of New York's central business district, local commodity exchanges are still struggling to recover.
The US trading floor for coffee, cocoa, sugar and orange juice was destroyed when the south tower of the World Trade Center collapsed, damaging the adjacent New York Board of Trade. 
The show goes on, however, this time relocated to cramped premises in a backup site in Queens. 
The world's largest energy exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), based in the World Financial Center, was undamaged. But access to the building was made difficult by the surrounding carnage. It was almost a week before Nymex traders were able to return to the floor for abbreviated trading sessions. 
The attack completely eclipsed the recent rivalry between Nymex and its largest competitor, the International Petroleum Exchange. 
Some traders used to say that Nymex and the IPE each had one big worry. Nymex feared the IPE would develop serious electronic trading capacity and the IPE worried that Nymex would create a rival Brent oil contract. 
Both fears came true this year. 
First the IPE agreed to a takeover by the InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an internet market for over-the-counter energy and metal derivatives. 
For the IPE, this means ICE will develop the systems to take it fully electronic in 12-18 months. 
For ICE, it means access to clearing facilities. It recently announced that users would be able to clear ICE's West Texas Intermediate and Henry Hub natural gas swaps through the London Clearing House, alongside their IPE futures business. 
Then, in retaliation, Nymex launched a Brent contract this month and made it clear that, in New York at least, the future of open outcry trading would be preserved. Major incentives to trade the new Brent contract led several IPE floor traders to say they planned to relocate to New York. 
The terrorist attack abruptly interrupted the contest, at a time when it was important for Nymex to gather momentum. 
The US exchange has a limited window of opportunity to build up liquidity in its own Brent contract before the IPE's electronic platform is fully established. Some analysts think the contest will be won or lost even earlier, arguing that Brent must take off in the first few weeks of trade if it is to succeed at all. 
In the meantime, digital trading is still a contentious issue among IPE users. Some - not least the independent local traders - prefer open outcry. Others like the idea of a system where new products can be more cheaply and easily introduced. 
Where most of them do agree, however, is the advantages of real time risk management, and straight-through-processing which automates paperwork and reduces the risk of costly back-office errors. 
Other exchanges, too, are divided on the advantages of electronic trade. London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) commodity contracts went electronic late last year, but the London Metal Exchange is keeping open outcry. 
The LME launched a more sophisticated version of its electronic platform this month but Simon Heale, chief executive, has made it clear that open outcry will continue until LME members say otherwise. 
As competition between exchanges intensifies, there is pressure on managers to ensure that their market remains the market of choice. ""You have to consistently review your contracts to ensure that they continue to be successful. You have to ask yourself: 'is this still what the market wants?'"" said an IPE director. 
Liffe, for example, is planning on expanding its product range into weather derivatives, and has already started publishing three European weather indices. The exchange is also looking at expanding its portfolio of wheat products and is considering introducing an arabica coffee product to add to its existing robusta futures. 
Recent experience shows that some new products can take time to bed down, however. Weather derivatives - strictly speaking closer to an insurance contract than a typical commodity derivative - have a good following in the over-the-counter market, but the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is not yet seeing much call for its standardised weather derivatives, launched in 1999. 
Bandwidth futures, offered by anumber of online exchanges, also have yet to reach their full potential. Set up on the assumption that surplus network capacity would become a tradeable commodity, bandwidth exchanges have been hit hard by the decline in telecoms business. 
One of this year's latest products, Euronext's Bordeaux wine future, has yet to prove itself. 
Even computer memory is becoming commoditised. Enron has plans afoot for an over-the-counter DRAM market. Commodity exchange executives are not quite ready for DRAM futures. For the time being, they say, rapid technological change makes microchips too much of a moving target to form a standardised contract.

Groups ask state to reconsider PGE rate hike

09/24/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Three business and consumer groups asked state regulators Monday to reconsider their approval of impending rate increases of 30 percent and more for Portland General Electric customers. 
Motions filed with the state Public Utility Commission also said the increases, due to take effect Oct. 1, should be suspended until the PUC decides whether to take another look at the issue.
The requests were filed by Associated Oregon Industries, Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities and the Citizens' Utility Board, claiming the PUC didn't consider the economic impact of such large and sudden increases. 
The increases announced by the commission on Aug. 31 will raise rates by about 32 percent for residential customers, 37 percent for small business and as much as 53 percent for industrial consumers, depending on consumption. 
PGE is the state's biggest electric utility, serving about 730,000 customers. 
PUC spokesman Bob Valdez said commissioners would try to give an answer soon. 
""The commissioners are aware of the timing issue and are trying to expedite this,"" he said. 
While large, he said, the rate increases weren't unexpected. 
""The commissioners were aware the increases were significant and looked at the case for 11 months,"" he said. ""The lion's share, 80 percent to 90 percent, was due to rising wholesale power costs."" 
Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group, said current economic conditions make a rate review necessary.

USA: Enron shares in stay in doldrums after downgrade.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. 
Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.
Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. 
Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. 
Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. 
Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's.
By Jonathan Stempel

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. 
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. 
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. 
""Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. ""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year."" 
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a ""lagging"" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. 
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. 
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. 
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or ""junk""-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. 
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. 
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,"" he said. ""That is a positive for credit quality."" 
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

USA: Enron shares drop despite further triage attempts.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995.
Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a move to shore up investor confidence.

The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
Enron shares sank 50 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $15 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. ((David Howard Sinkman, New York Newsdesk 646-223-6094)).

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a new move to shore up investor confidence after it tapped about $3 billion in credit last week, and to stop a plunge in the company's stock that set new six-year lows. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.
Enron shares crashed through a psychological barrier of $15 a share, shedding $1.66, or 10.65 percent, to $13.85 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than half of its value in the past two weeks, losing more than $14 billion in market capitalization. 
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston. 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
""Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits,"" said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson.

POWER POINTS:Enron May Have To Rethink Asset-Light Focus
By Mark Golden

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a ""death spiral"" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. 
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. 
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. 
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. 
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. 
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or ""shareholders' equity,"" by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. 
Long-Running Concerns 

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. 
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. 
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. 
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. 
""Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story,"" Wasden said. 
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. 
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. 
""We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company,"" Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. ""This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point."" 
Keeping Talent A Challenge 

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. 
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. 
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. 
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. 
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for ""personal reasons."" When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."" 
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? 
""I don't know anybody who said that,"" Wasden said. ""What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?"" 
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. 
""Enron has been a cult, more than a company,"" he said. ""Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside."" 
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. 
""There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants,"" he said. 
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.

Enron CEO Skilling resigns, replaced by chairman Lay

NEW YORK (AP) - After less than a year at the helm of energy giant Enron Corp., president and chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling unexpectedly resigned Tuesday, citing personal reasons. 
Chairman Kenneth Lay will take over both positions, the Houston-based company said in a statement.
""I am resigning for personal reasons. I want to thank Ken Lay for his understanding of this purely personal decision, and I want to thank the board and all of my colleagues at Enron,"" said Skilling, who replaced Lay as CEO in February. 
""We regret Jeff's decision to resign, as he has been a big part of our success for over eleven years,"" said Lay. 
Enron, which earned dlrs 979 million on revenue of dlrs 100.79 billion in 2000, owns a 25,000-mile (40,000-kilometer) gas pipeline and merchant power plants in the United States and abroad producing 9,000 megawatts of electricity. 
The company has shed many energy assets, including the unit devoted to natural gas and crude oil drilling, now called EOG Resources Inc., to pursue its goal of becoming the industry's premier middleman, bringing together buyers and sellers of energy products. The company also trades metals, paper and fiber-optic bandwidth. 
Skilling will continue to work as a consultant for the Houston-based natural gas and power marketing company. 
Lay, who was Enron's CEO from 1985 until Feburary 2001, has also agreed to continue working for the company through 2005. 
Shares of Enron were off dlrs 2.43, or 5 percent, to dlrs 40.50, in after-hours trading after finishing the regular session on the New York Stock Exchange up 78 cents to dlrs 42.93.

579,"Well, this is interesting.  Are they talking about the same period during which gas costs were supposed to have been so unreasonably, and allegedly illegally, high due to the actions of those greedy Texas energy firms?

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : August 10, 2001
SoCalGas Posts $223 Million in Gas-Cost Savings 
California regulators may be scratching their heads about what to do with gas purchasing incentives for the state's major utilities following Southern California Gas Co.'s filing that claims its purchases over a 12-month period ending last June were $223 million below market prices. 
It was the ""largest amount of savings on gas costs during any one-year period in our 134-year history"" of SoCalGas, which is owned by San Diego-based Sempra Energy, according to Anne Smith, a vice president quoted in a report to the company's employees. 
Under a regulator-approved ""gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) that has been in place in recent years, the utility can apply a formula allowing it to share the savings between customers and shareholders."" It's an incentive to the utility ""to take reasonable risks to keep gas costs low, while ensuring a reliable supply,"" SoCalGas's director of gas acquisition, Jim Harrigan, told employees in the recent report. 
With this relatively embarrassing ""windfall"" for shareholders, the utility recommended to the California Public Utilities Commission in June two options for spreading the wealth: 
1.	Give shareholders a relatively modest $30.8 million and make the utility's proposed adjustments to the GCIM program in future years. The modifications were agreed to many months ago in a settlement among SoCalGas; the CPUC; the Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA); and the statewide utility consumer group TURN (The Utility Reform Network); or 
2.	Award $106 million to the utility's shareholders, which is what SoCalGas says is the shareholders' share under the current GCIM formula. 
Both options carry proposed rate increases to implement them. The first would necessitate a 44 cents/month increase for a 12-month period, while the second alternative would require a $1.52/month hike for one year. "

Energy crisis back on front burner 
Staffers' stocks rekindle political heat and may jeopardize power contracts. 
August 5, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
and JAMES B. KELLEHER
The Orange County Register 
Just when California seemed to be crawling out from under the wreckage of its year-old energy crisis, the state finds itself embroiled in a new crisis. 
In the past week, more than half a dozen advisers to Gov. Gray Davis, including some hired at taxpayer expense specifically to buy power from generating companies, admitted that they owned shares of generating companies or utilities. Five were fired, and one resigned. 
One of the state's top negotiators of long-term power-purchase contracts, consultant Vikram Budhraja, is the subject of an inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He disclosed he profited from trading shares of Edison International, parent of Southern California Edison, during days when the state was negotiating energy contracts and buying electricity to keep the firm from bankruptcy. 
These conflict-of-interest revelations represent more than an embarrassment for the governor. 
They also threaten to prolong a crisis that has already cost weary Californians as much as $100 billion by some estimates - easily the most expensive public-policy disaster in state history. 
If the contracts are found to have been compromised by state negotiators who had conflicts of interest, they could be nullified. If that happens, the state could find itself back where it was in January: scrambling to find reliable, inexpensive sources of power to stave off blackouts and avoid breaking the state budget. 
Some in Sacramento would like nothing better than to undo the contracts, which they say cost the state too much at $43 billion over 20 years. 
""The Legislature is dying to find a way out of those contracts,"" said Peter Navarro, a professor of economics at University of California, Irvine. 
""If there is any possibility that the conflict of interest can nullify some or all of those, then you will see some forward movement on this,"" Navarro said. 
Of course, if the state does renegotiate the contracts, it could wind up getting better prices. 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the author of California's electricity-purchasing law (AB1X), said there has been sentiment in the Legislature to renegotiate some contracts if possible. 
""I guess it would be too much to hope for to have the luck to have the ability to renegotiate or unwind some of the contracts,"" he said, adding that it was clear that under some contracts, the prices were high. 
However, ""there are a lot of people like me who think the governor did exactly the right thing in these contracts by buying long, which is what we instructed him to do in AB1X,"" he said. 
The revelations come at an awkward time for the state. Last week, while the disclosures mounted, state Treasurer Phil Angelides was on Wall Street, trying to drum up interest in the $12.5 billion bond sale intended to repay the state for the $9.6 billion it has spent purchasing power for consumers so far this year. 
But so far, the disclosures don't seem to have raised more than an eyebrow or two on Wall Street. 
""What we're interested in is, are we going to get paid back?"" said Mary Beth Syal, a municipal bond portfolio manager at Payden & Rygel, a Los Angeles investment firm with expertise in fixed income. ""As a bondholder you really don't care about (conflicts of interest) except if there's fraud. Then it becomes an issue. Anything else and it really doesn't have an impact."" 
Or as Zane Mann, the editor of the California Municipal Bond Advisor, put it: ""If municipal bond investors didn't buy bonds every time some adviser turned out to be a crook, there wouldn't be a municipal bond market."" 
The current crisis over conflicts of interest has its roots in January. With power prices skyrocketing, Southern California Edison defaulting on bond payments and energy producers threatening to push the state's utilities into bankruptcy and stop selling electricity into California, Davis declared an emergency - putting the state in the electricity-buying business. 
Davis tried to bring some expertise on board, hurriedly hiring consultants, buyers, schedulers and others, in what his spokesman, Steve Maviglio, concedes was a chaotic and desperate push. 
Many qualified people had already been hired by power-trading companies, leaving a small pool of candidates for the specialized tasks, said Maviglio. 
""DWR was in an emergency situation, and we hired the best people we could that were available,"" he said. ""The number of people in the energy-buying business in California is limited. This is not a job where you just put an ad in the classifieds. There were not a lot of experienced traders in the field."" 
In the rush to bring staff on board and keep the lights on in the state, however, Davis and his team neglected to get many of the new hires to fill out personal financial disclosures required by California's Political Reform Act. Under that law, state employees have 30 days to disclose their financial interests and must update them yearly. 
Then, last month, under prodding from Secretary of State Bill Jones, who blasted Davis' failure to ensure his energy advisers complied with the act, disclosures started pouring in - and revelations started pouring out. 
Jones, a Republican candidate for governor next year, says at least some of the contracts may be at risk. State Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing the financial-disclosure statements of the DWR's energy consultants for conflicts of interest and potential prosecutions, said Lockyer spokesman Nathan Barankin. 
State law bars government employees from negotiating contracts with companies in which they have a financial interest. It also says those contracts may be invalidated if conflicts existed, but only if at least one of the parties to a contract requests it. Then a court must rule whether there was a conflict and if it was of a magnitude to warrant nullifying the contract. 
But the Davis administration's review of the contracts shows that none is imperiled, Maviglio said. 
""Our understanding is that they are solid - all of them,"" he said. ""Everything is being reviewed, but at first glance they appear to be solid."" 
Others question whether Davis can review the contracts impartially, since he hired the advisers who negotiated them, and he trumpeted them as a key solution that helped bring down power prices and kept the state blackout-free this summer. 
""Davis can't question the propriety of the contracts without questioning his own propriety,"" Navarro said. ""Maviglio has to circle the wagons."" 
Maviglio disclosed last week that he bought $12,000 worth of shares of San Jose-based generator Calpine Corp. in June. He sold it last week at a loss of about $1,200. 
As the debate goes on in Sacramento, investors on Wall Street seem keen only to learn more about the bond deal's structure and timing. The bond sale has been delayed from May until at least October, and could be delayed further because of opposition by the state's utilities to the way consumer rates would repay the bonds. 
Angelides, who believes the sale will take place by late October, bragged last week that most of the uncertainties that forced the state to postpone the bond deal had cleared up, thanks to conservation, the state's actions and some luck. 
""As a factual matter,"" Angelides said, ""costs and prices are down, volatility is reduced through a combination of efforts - everything from contracts to federal controls to return to production to conservation efforts. 
""The importance of this for the financing program, and I want to stress this, is that the level of volatility in the marketplace and with respect to DWR costs has been dramatically reduced, which is important in terms of folks looking at the stability and certainty of the revenue flow going forward."" 
But if contracts are nullified, some of that volatility could return. DWR would be forced to make more purchases on the unpredictable spot market. That could throw another wrench into the state's plans to recover its power-buying expenditures and return normalcy to the market. 
""Every time there is another layer of stench put on top of one of these contracts, there is more risk perceived in Wall Street, and more burden placed on taxpayers and ratepayers,"" Navarro said. 
State staffers and advisers posing conflict-of-interest questions 
A rundown of known conflicts of interest, actual and potential: 
Five consultants at the Department of Water Resources - William F. Mead, Richard Ferreira, Peggy Cheng, Herman Leung and Constantine Louie - were fired after their disclosure statements, filed under pressure six months late, showed they negotiated state power purchases with companies whose stock they owned. 
A sixth consultant who also had purchased stock, Elaine Griffin, resigned July 14 to take another job. 
The DWR's top attorney, Susan Weber, who had a role in advising the consultants, was reassigned to another state job unrelated to energy. She had no financial conflict. 
Gov. Gray Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, bought 300 shares of Calpine Corp. in June at $40 a share. Under pressure, he sold it Thursday at $36 a share. Calpine, a San Jose-based power generator, received about $13 billion in electricity contracts with the state for the next 20 years. 
Two political consultants, Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, whose firm has done work for Southern California Edison, were hired by Davis and placed on the state payroll at $30,000 a month. Both left under pressure, including a lawsuit by a taxpayers group and complaints that the governor used state funds to finance political work. 
Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, the author of energy-related legislation - including the creation of the state's Public Power Authority - has investments in El Paso Energy Co., which he acquired last July, and Exxon Mobil Corp., Haliburton Co. and Meeker Investments. He also bought and sold between $10,000 and $100,000 worth of Williams Co. stock last fall. 
The governor's top Wall Street adviser for energy is Joseph Fichera, head of Saber Partners LLC. Fichera and his company have a $275,000-a-month state contract that provides a bonus of up to $14.6 million if the state purchases Southern California Edison's grid. Fichera has not provided a financial-disclosure statement, saying the government's rules do not require it. He has said he has no energy holdings that conflict with California's power-purchasing program. 
Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting Inc., hired in January by DWR, bought between $10,000 and $100,000 of General Electric Co. and Enron Corp. stock in April. 
Vikram Budhraja, a former Edison executive, has a $6.2 million contract to negotiate long-term energy contracts for the state. He bought and sold Edison and Dynegy stock during January, when he was hired. The Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing his transactions, his lawyer said. 
William Keese, the chairman of the California Energy Commission, which licenses power plants, has purchased and sold energy stocks during his tenure on the commission. The stocks were in managed portfolios, not subject to his control. Keese has asked the Fair Political Practices Commission to investigate. 
Bruce G. Willison, a member of the state's Electricity Oversight Board, owns about $600,000 in Enron stock. 
Disclosing conflicts can be a convoluted process 
Public officials at every level of state and local government must reveal personal financial information. 
Elected officials, judges and high-ranking appointed officials must make the most comprehensive disclosures. 
This includes interests in real property, investments, sources of personal income and outside employment, including directorships and consulting contracts. The reports are filed annually at the headquarters of the state's Fair Political Practices Commission. 
For other officials, such as the employees of state and local governments, it is up to each agency to set disclosure requirements, following the policy set by the FPPC. These reports are filed with the individual agency. 
Not every person on the public payroll, however, is required to disclose personal financial information. At the Department of Water Resources, for example, consultants who were hired to perform duties that are ""limited in scope"" are exempt. 
A conflict of interest occurs when a public official uses his or her position to make decisions that result in personal financial gain. 
Assets and income that could be affected by an official's actions must be disclosed and, in many cases, divested. 
Officials cannot negotiate contracts with companies in which they have a financial interest. If this happens, the contracts could be subject to nullifcation. 
The state attorney general or local prosecutors determine whether a conflict has occurred, and whether a criminal prosecution is necessary. The FPPC can investigate, but not prosecute, and can impose civil fines of up to $2,000 per violation.

586,"FYI, the California dockets are on the agenda for the Commission's meeting next Wednesday.  We expect the FERC to order an evidentiary hearing on the refund issue.  We will keep you posted."
587,"Attached is a proposed decision addressing the CEC's two petitions to modify
Decision 01-05-064 (the rate design decision) with respect to Real Time
Pricing.

In its first petition, CEC asked that the Commission clarify that the meters
provided by CEC pursuant to ABX1 29 for customers whose usage is greater
than 200kW at peak demand must be accepted by the customer (i.e.,
installation is mandatory).  In addition, CEC asked that the Commission
remove the language from the decision which requires customers who receive
the meters be shifted to TOU rate schedules.  The PD grants the request in
part, clarifying that  the receipt of the meters is mandatory.  With respect
to mandatory TOU participation for customers who receive the meters, the PD
modifies the language to provide that for customers receiving an RTP meter
who are not already on a TOU schedule the choice of enrolling in a demand
reduction program, rather than being automatically shifted to a TOU schedule
(customers must make this election within 15 days of installation of the
meter or they will be automatically placed on a TOU schedule).

In its second petition, the CEC requested the adoption of a pro forma RTP
tariff.  The PD denies the petition, citing several concerns with the CEC's
proposed tariff.  Chief among the concerns are (1) it is not a true
real-time pricing program because it does not use a transparent real-time
price; (2) the level of complexity in the calculation of the customer
baseline loads; (3) the potential for gaming of the system which would
result in in large amount of payments for load reductions that either would
have occurred anyway or are phantom reductions;(4) the fact that there is no
authorization to make DWR the entity financially responsible for the payment
of incentive costs .

The PD goes on to give the Commission's thoughts as to what a real time
pricing program should look like. Thus the PD states that real time pricing
should be transparent to customers such that they know in advance how the
prices will be calculated.  The calculation should be based on real prices
(or if a forecasted price issues, it should be close enough to real prices
to achieve the proper price signal). The program should be administratively
simple.  The PD suggest that ease o administration argues for programs where
customers are charged a real time price based on actual usage and not by a
comparison of actual usage to either a forecasted or historical load.


The UDCs, and any other party who  wants to, are directed to submit real
time pricing proposals by August 17th which follow the guidance given in the
PD.

Comments on the proposed decision are due on July 26th.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Assembly's MOU Supporters ""MIA,"" Vote Stalled =20
Bailout Hang -Ups: Land, Bonds, and Referendum
SoCal Up for Grabs?

MOU Support Waning=20
As of last night, Assemblyman Hertzberg reportedly had 25 votes in favor of=
 the bailout that he could ""count on.""  There were 10 more votes that were =
""close"" and stood a ""reasonable chance"" of being cast in favor of the bailo=
ut.  However, that still left Hertzberg 9 votes short of the 41 he needs.  =
Earlier today, Sen. Polanco, the bill's sponsor, privately indicated that t=
he few remaining votes necessary to pass the amended SB 78XX were in place =
due to lobbying efforts by Gov. Davis.  No doubt the count will be close, b=
ut Hertzberg will only take the bill up in the Assembly for a vote today or=
 tomorrow if he knows Democrats can muster enough support.   =20

The key issues related to getting the 41 votes to pass SB 78XX are the foll=
owing:=20
Including the option to buy the transmission lines.  For some this is a phi=
losophical issue; these members are quite adamant that the option to buy th=
e lines needs to be removed from SB 78XX.
Excess profits and creditworthiness - In particular how Edison can use any =
profits.=20
The philosophy underlying the bill itself as to whether a bailout is necess=
ary given the experience with PG&E.  And members are skittish about voting =
for a bailout with the possibility of a bankruptcy still possible anyway.

According to Assembly leadership sources, no Senator has asked the Speaker'=
s Office for anything to be put in the bill (except for a Central Valley se=
nator, Jim Costa, who played a party in brokering the deal on Shaver Lake).=
  Leadership sources were surprised by that, and believe that many senators=
 will not hold to the Burton line of ""don't even change a period in the bil=
l.""  Several senators including Polanco and Costa are vested in the bill's =
passage and will want to see it brought up for a vote despite significant o=
pposition. =20

Many people, including Polanco, believe that Burton may require his worker'=
s compensation reform plan to be double-joined to the Edison MOU in order t=
o take it up for a vote.  Double joining is a legislative maneuver that tie=
s the fate of both bills together.  It creates a situation where both must =
be passed by the legislature and signed by the Governor in order to go into=
 effect.  If the Governor only signs one, neither becomes law.  But the Gov=
ernor's office has told us that Burton made a direct statement to them last=
 week that he had no intention to double join workers comp reform to SB 78x=
x. =20

Some suggest that Senate opposition lead by Burton (which remains considera=
ble) may introduce a new bailout bill if SB 78XX passes the Assembly.  This=
 new bill would be designed to be unacceptable to the Assembly.  The Senate=
 then would pass this bill on the last day of the session, and then adjourn=
 without a conference committee.  The Assembly would then be left to accept=
 or reject the Senate's bill without the possibility of amendments.  (This =
is somewhat similar to what the Senate did in July, only now the recess wil=
l be until next year.)

SoCal Bailout Barriers
Regarding media reports referencing Assemblyman Keely's deal with Davis to =
exempt 5,000-acres of the Shaver Lake area from the bill's conservation eas=
ements, the protesters representing Fresno feel that this is not good enoug=
h and they intend to pursue their lawsuit against the state regarding the e=
asements.  These protestors (and the Republicans who represent them) felt t=
hat they had achieved compromise language in the bailout last week, but thi=
s language is now gone.  While the Shaver Lake amendments (and all conserva=
tion easement language) are again in the bill, we do not believe this will =
significantly interfere with the bill's passage.  Some Central Valley membe=
rs voted in support of the bill despite the amendments, and there is only o=
ne Democrat, Dean Florez, who may vote against it because of them.

Some Senators also reportedly considering removing language from the bond p=
ortion of the bailout bill that makes the bonds ""Harvey-proof"" - that is, i=
mmune from a referendum by consumer advocates.  This language, which was pr=
eviously used in the California rate reduction bonds, is structured such th=
at California's credit could be compromised if the bonds are not repaid (th=
is is done by involving the California Infrastructure Bank as a party to th=
e bonds).  Some members of the Senate who are in close contact with Harvey =
Rosenfield and the consumer advocates have expressed that they want to remo=
ve this language as a diplomatic way to destroy the bailout.  If the langua=
ge is removed, there is no way that the state's credit is tied to the bonds=
.  This means that the bonds can be challenged by a voter referendum withou=
t endangering the state.  Current polls show that such a referendum, which =
would allow voters to choose not to pay the surcharge on power bills to bai=
l out SoCal, would very likely succeed.  This would mean that the bonds cou=
ld not be repaid.
=20
Wall Street firms have stated expressly that they will not purchase the bon=
ds if they are susceptible to a voter referendum, meaning that removing the=
 ""Harvey-proofing"" language will likely mean that the bailout bonds will no=
t be able to be sold.  SoCal is also aware of this possibility; if the lang=
uage comes out of the bill, the plan will no longer be acceptable to SoCal.

SoCal: Selling Out or Going Under
There is word in Sacramento of companies ""sniffing around"" for a pre-packag=
ed purchase of Edison after the bankruptcy occurs.  We will continue to inv=
estigate possible buyers and report when information becomes available.
=20
It is also rumored that if an ""inadequate"" bill passes - i.e., one that wil=
l not return SoCal to creditworthiness - SoCal may declare voluntary bankru=
ptcy, then use whatever bailout is passed as a revenue stream in bankruptcy=
.  The only requirement laid upon SoCal is to attempt to go back into the m=
arket by January 2003, and there is no penalty for them failing to do so.  =
There appears to be nothing in the bailout bill that would preclude them fr=
om using money from the bailout in bankruptcy."

Bandwidth Market: Trade For DS3 Capacity Nets High Price

07/24/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A direct trade done Tuesday for DS3 bandwidth between 
Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., brought one of the highest prices ever recorded 
in the market. 
The deal, priced at two cents a DS0 mile a month, will start as soon as the 
circuit can be provisioned, said a trader.
Direct trades are done by the counterparties themselves without an 
intermediary like a broker. 
Another direct deal was done for DS3 bandwidth between Seattle and Los 
Angeles for a three-month contract that also will start as soon as the 
circuit is provisioned. The price was $0.0075/DS0 mile/month. 
One other trade was done Tuesday for DS3 bandwidth in calendar year 2002 
between New York and Dallas through Enron Corp. pooling points at $0.0015/DS0 
mile/month. 
Pooling points are network interconnection sites where title to bandwidth is 
transferred. They are also used to monitor quality of service.

What I would like is to come up with a coherent message on hedging in CA, 
particularly the core-non-core issues, so that at the end of the day, EES 
still has a market and ENA can sell hedges to the LDCs.  Sue Landwehr in Gov

621,"The CPUC has protested the ISO's recent replacement of Volume Nos. I and II 
of its tariff.  The ISO's tariff filing does not propose changes to any 
substantive provision and is intended to be an uncontroversial filing to 
comply with the designation and formatting requirements of FERC's Order 614.  
Nevertheless, the CPUC:

Asks FERC to reject and modify the confidentiality and disclosure provisions 
of the tariff such that they do not apply to requests for information from 
California state agencies with statutory responsibilities related to 
regulation or oversight of the electric industry.  CPUC asks the provisions 
be modified to require the ISO to respond to such requests in the same manner 
as it responds to data requests from FERC itself.
Points out that the ISO has used this provision to refuse to provide 
responses to the CPUC's subpoena including bid data.  
Also asserts that the Western System Coordinating Council's (WSCC) extra high 
voltage (EHV) data is available in real time to all WSCC members, including 
market participants.

I was wondering if others agree we should file an answer to the CPUC's 
answer, stating the following.

The ISO should make all market information available to all market 
participants as we laid out in our comments on the FERC's November 1 order.
Not all market participants get EHV data - since [date?] the ISO has refused 
to provide this information to the WSCC unless the WSCC keeps this 
information confidential, due to its tariff's confidentiality provisions.  
Accordingly the ISO's data is now only being provided to those market 
participants with control areas. However, we have no way of knowing, and 
therefore assume that utilities, munis, and Federal Power Marketing 
Administrations with control areas are providing this information to their 
merchant function.  This access to market information is unduly 
discriminatory.  To rectify this undue discrimination, the FERC should delete 
the confidentiality provision altogether.
The CPUC's filing is procedurally defective in that the ISO did not change 
the confidentiality provision of its tariff so the CPUC's filing should have 
been in a complaint in which it would have the burden of proof.  Therefore, 
the FERC should dismiss the CPUC's filing."

_________________________________________________________________________
The interest rates on Federal education loans are variable and change on
July 1, based on the 91-day T-Bill rate from the last Treasury auction in
May plus a statutory percentage add-on (1.7% in-school, 2.3% in repayment).
That auction was on May 29, 2001, with a rate of 3.688%, which rounds to
3.69%. According to the formula, the new applicable interest rates are as
follows effective July 1:

                  In-School Rate  Repayment Rate
Direct Loans        5.39%           5.99%

Thus, interest rates have dropped by 2.2% and are lower than they have been
in many years. Students who have not yet consolidated their federal loans
should consider consolidating after July 1 in order to lock in these low
rates, even (especially) if they are still in school. Consolidation is an
optional process wherein the rate is a weighted average interest rate of
the loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest 1/8th of one
percent.  This interest rate becomes fixed for the life of the consolidated
loan.

According to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.com, ""a student with
$16,000 in debt who consolidates at 6.0% (5.99% rounded up to the nearest
1/8th of a point) will save $2,233.52 over the lifetime of the loan
compared with consolidating at 8.25% (8.19% rounded up to the nearest 1/8th
of a point). If the student consolidates while still in school to take
advantage of the in-school rate, the rate used will be 5.5% (5.39% rounded
up to the nearest 1/8th of a point), and will yield an additional savings
of $478.93 for a total savings $2,712.45 over the lifetime of the loan.

""Caveat: It is possible that the Fed will continue to cut interest rates
and that this will continue to be reflected in auction results, so that
next May the rates will be even lower. But there is also the risk that the
Fed rate cuts will end, and that the rates next May will be higher. Given
that the current rates are the lowest in many years and the savings already
substantial, the safest course of action is to consolidate after July 1,
2001 and before June 30, 2002.""

However, if you are planning to consolidate I would suggest doing so before
September 30, 2001 to take advantage of an additional 0.8% interest rate
reduction.  Refer to the first attached Word file for details on this and
the consolidation process.

*It is not too late to apply for 2001-2002 federal student loans*
If you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and are interested in
borrowing a 5.39% Direct Loan, you may still apply by following the
instructions in the second attached Word file.

This may seem complicated to you, but the attachments really do answer your
questions, so please read them thoroughly before e-mailing me.

In Energy Shortages, New Demand for Enron
By ELIZABETH R. SMITH

04/01/2001
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CALIFORNIA'S rolling blackouts and a looming energy crisis in other parts of 
the country are stoking investor interest in companies positioned to reap 
benefits from the power shortages. 
Many investors, stunned by the market's precipitous fall, see energy as one 
of the few sectors with a promising profit outlook.
And in that so-called energy merchant sector, the Enron Corporation stands 
out as the industry leader. Based in Houston, it buys and sells wholesale 
electricity, natural gas and scores of other commodities, including broadband 
capacity for data-delivery services. In the fourth quarter of 2000, Enron's 
revenue more than tripled, to $40.75 billion, from the period a year earlier. 
That mushrooming revenue can be traced to the unprecedented surge in the 
price of electricity and natural gas, particularly in California. On Tuesday, 
California power regulators approved a 46 percent increase in electricity 
rates, the largest in the state's history. Electricity shortfalls have also 
been predicted for New York City this summer. 
Despite its red-hot market, Enron is no bargain. Its share price surged 87 
percent in 2000, to end the year at $83.125, up from $44.375 a year earlier. 
It hit a 12-month, intraday high of $90.75 on Aug. 23, around the time that 
California's utilities first sounded the alarm. And even though Enron has 
taken some hits this year, the stock closed at $58.10 on Friday, 39.5 times 
its 2001 earnings per share, well above its peers. On March 22, it fell to a 
12-month low of $51.51 amid concerns about possible layoffs in its broadband 
operations, but rebounded after Jeffrey K. Skilling, the chief executive, 
assured investors that all was well in broadband. 
Enron's edge is its sheer size and its recognized competence in helping 
corporate clients cope with unprecedented swings in electricity prices. Enron
, in turn, charges a premium to manage the risk of energy price movements, 
said Donato J. Eassey, a natural-gas analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''They have 
market intelligence that is second to none,'' he said. ''They help firms 
lower the cost by avoiding the spot market for power.'' 
The value of Enron's broadband effort and its core wholesale energy 
operations have yet to be fully reflected in its stock price, he added, 
predicting that shares will climb to $99.20 in 12 months. 
Raymond C. Niles, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, also likes Enron 
because of its dominance. The company has unit operating margins that are two 
to three times that of its closest competitor, Dynegy, in wholesale energy, 
he said: ''When the heat is on literally, people need a company like Enron 
for physical delivery because it has so many ways to get them that 
resource.'' He predicted that the stock would rise to $100 within 12 months. 
Neither analyst is worried about developments in India, where Enron was 
forced to invoke government guarantees to recoup payment for power generated 
at its Dabhol power plant in the state of Maharashtra. 
OTHER experts favor Enron because it is not just a pure power play. The 
company, which is shedding many of its hard assets, has bet heavily on its 
prospects for buying and selling broadband capacity. Skeptics say the demand 
for broadband is nowhere near as immediate as the need for energy, but Amy M. 
Jaffe, a senior energy adviser at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public 
Policy at Rice University in Houston, said Enron was smart to move into 
broadband. 
''They might be in broadband too early, but that's O.K., she said, ''There 
will be demand for it.'' 
Enron's expansion into data delivery, as well as its market-making of energy 
commodities, help distinguish it from classic energy businesses like oil 
companies, she said. 
Lawrence R. Fuller, a senior portfolio manager at the Merrill Lynch 
Fundamental Growth fund, says Enron is his largest energy holding. 
''The company is controversial because its valuation is very high,'' Mr. 
Fuller said. ''But they have a tremendous lead over their rivals and a 
mastery of their business. You have tremendous economies of scale here that 
drive their profit.''

PULL THE PLUG / Not enough sunshine on politics of water board
Staff

04/01/2001
Houston Chronicle
4 STAR

(Copyright 2001)

The time has come to pull the plug on the Houston Area Water Corp., the 
citizen board called ""the Hawk"" that is in the process of recommending a 
company to design, build and operate a water plant at Lake Houston. 
The members of the Hawk board appear to have done their job thoroughly and 
conscientiously. The board's chairman, attorney David Berg, has been 
commendably outspoken about his concerns for the bidding process and the 
wherewithal of Azurix Corp., a troubled affiliate of energy giant Enron Corp. 
and one of three companies in the final running for the contract.
However, the political maneuverings and pressures being placed behind the 
scenes on both city staff evaluating the bid proposals and the Hawk board 
bear much more scrutiny than can be gained in the format of this 
quasi-private corporation. 
City Attorney Anthony Hall, reported the Chronicle's Mary Flood, started an 
hourlong, heated argument with Berg at a March 21 mayoral fund-raiser over 
the possibility that Azurix, rumored as the favorite of Mayor Lee Brown's 
administration, might not win the bid. 
Sources familiar with the argument told Flood that Hall threatened Berg that 
he would dismantle the Hawk if the process that kept Azurix as the winning 
recommendation was not followed. Hall denied he said anything like that, 
saying his complaints were about procedures. Berg would not comment 
specifically on that matter. 
Hall, according to Flood's report, said he told Berg that because the 
companies had relied on a long-established formula for choosing the 
front-runner, it would invite trouble to change or ignore the formula now. 
But the companies said they were never told about the formula and have had 
nothing specific to rely on about how the staff or the Hawk board would make 
its decision. 
The pressure brought to bear on the Hawk, in such an unsavory way and without 
public controls, is extremely troubling. These boards clearly were never 
intended to handle projects so politically divisive, with so much money at 
stake. 
The water plant contract under bid is worth $150 million. The water project 
it is part of could reach $2 billion. 
State Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, who wrote the statute allowing local 
government corporations such as Hawk, said he never intended these citizen 
boards to handle projects as large as the water plant. 
Politicians who want to guide this process ought to be willing to do it 
openly and face both the public scrutiny and the consequences of their 
actions. 
For that reason - not because the bid award may not go the way the city 
administration wants it to - the Hawk corporation should be dissolved.

USA: Exxon Mobil tops Fortune 500 list, replacing GM.

04/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. , aided by higher oil prices, 
ousted automaker General Motors Corp. from the No. 1 ranking in the Fortune 
500 list of the largest American companies, the business magazine said on 
Sunday. 
""The country faced an energy crunch as the drain on resources from several 
years of economic expansion collided with utility deregulation, soaring 
natural gas prices, and OPEC's maneuvering to keep oil prices high,"" Lee 
Clifford, a writer for the Magazine, said the article about the reasons 
behind Exxon's gain from the No. 3 spot in 1999.
With revenues for 2000 at a record $210 billion, Exxon, the most profitable 
company with $17.7 billion in net income in 2000, outpaced No. 2 Wal-Mart by 
$17 billion and No. 3 GM by $26 billion. 
On the flip side of the surge for energy companies, high oil prices increased 
the cost of doing business for most companies, and had a big impact on 
corporate profits last year. 
Five out of the top 15 companies made less money than they did in 1999. 
Profits rose overall by 8.4 percent, down significantly from the prior year's 
28.7 percent growth. 
Rounding out the top ten of the Fortune 500 in order behind Exxon Mobil, 
Wal-Mart and GM: Ford Motor Co. ($180.6 billion in 2000 revenues); General 
Electric Co. ($129.9 billion); Citigroup ($111.8 billion); Enron Corp. 
($100.8 billion); International Business Machines Corp. ($88.4 billion); AT&T 
Corp. ($66.0 million); and Verizon Communications ($64.7 billion).

Exxon Mobil Tops 2001 Ranking of the Fortune 500; Oil giant replaces GM at 
top of list after 15 years; Mega-Retailer Wal-Mart is No. 2

(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 1, 2001--Exxon Mobil vaulted into the top 
spot on the annual FORTUNE 500 ranking of the largest American companies, 
replacing 15-year veteran GM. 
With revenues for 2000 at a record $210 billion, Exxon outpaced No. 2 
Wal-Mart by $17 billion and No. 3 GM by $26 billion. The FORTUNE 500 ranking 
has been dominated by two industries -- cars and oil -- since its inception 
in 1955: in 47 years, only two companies have been at the top of the list, 
Exxon (which merged with Mobil in 1999) and GM. The 2001 FORTUNE 500 list and 
related stories are available at www.fortune.com beginning at 6:00 p.m. ET 
Sunday, April 1.
Exxon Mobil wasn't the only oil company to jump in the rankings. ""The country 
faced an energy crunch as the drain on resources from several years of 
economic expansion collided with utility deregulation, soaring natural gas 
prices, and OPEC's maneuvering to keep oil prices high,"" FORTUNE's Lee 
Clifford writes in the introduction to the list. Those high prices helped 
other energy companies strike it rich: Duke Energy (No. 17) and Reliant 
Energy (No. 55) nearly doubled their revenues to catapult up the list, as did 
diversified energy companies like Enron (No. 7) and Dynegy (No. 54). ""Of 
course, should energy prices fall, these companies will have a tough time 
hanging onto their new spots on the FORTUNE 500,"" Clifford says. 
On the flip side of the surge for energy companies, high oil prices increased 
the cost of doing business for most companies, and had a big impact on 
corporate profits last year. Five out of the top 15 companies made less money 
than they did in 1999. Profits rose overall by 8.4%, down significantly from 
last year's 28.7% growth. Together, the FORTUNE 500 generated $7.2 trillion 
in sales (up more than 13% from last year), made $444 billion in profits, and 
employed 24 million people. No. 1 Exxon Mobil was the most profitable 
company, with profits rising 124% to $17.7 billion. 
No. 2 Wal-Mart, with revenues of $193 billion, is the largest employer in the 
FORTUNE 500, with 1.2 million employees (about the same as the population of 
Idaho). Geographically, California and New York top the state list with 55 
company headquarters each (New York City tops the city list with 40 company 
headquarters). Texas comes in third with 45 companies (including Irving-based 
Exxon Mobil, the No. 1 company; Houston is second on the city list with 20 
companies), Illinois is fourth with 39 and Ohio is fifth with 20 companies on 
the list.

Mobil's well-oiled profit-pumping machine. Carol Loomis visits Sandy Weill at 
Citigroup (No. 6) to see how an acquisition addict manages the world's most 
complicated company. Nelson Schwartz reveals how a toothpaste maker, 
Colgate-Palmolive (No. 201), has outperformed Jack Welch's GE (for 17 years). 
Devin Leonard asks who's the boss at Viacom (No. 101).

645,"On Friday (February 23rd), Commissioner Bilas issued an alternate decision
to the February 20th draft ALJ decision on interim implementation of the
California Procurement Adjustment.    Basically what the Bilas alternate
does is give DWR certain assurances, without any money right now.  It
provides Commission recognition that the purchases made by DWR are not
subject to Commission reasonableness review and that once DWR has provided
the Commission with its needed revenue requirement that the Commission must
pass it through to ratepayers.  What it does not do is implement a CPA
mechanism.  The Bilas draft recognizes that the matter is being dressed
through the process established by ALJ Deulloa and a decision on it should
be rendered by the end of March. The Bilas draft also states that the
Commission ""shall stay action on implementation of suspension of direct
access under water code section 80110 until further order.""

If we want to comment on the Bilas draft, they are due on Friday the 2nd.  I
think Bilas' approach makes sense.  Adoption of the ALJ draft decision would
mean the implementation of an interim CPA mechanism for a few weeks, to
potentially be replaced by another interim mechanism at the end of March, to
ultimately be replaced by a final CPA mechanism.

As for the Bilas language on direct access -- while it is good, I think we
were successful in removing the direct access suspension language from the
ALJ's Draft Decision (it was removed in the version released on the morning
of the last commission meeting), so I think we have that point covered
regardless of which order gets voted out.

I will fax a copy of the draft to Harry and Sue (I don't have an e-mail
version). Let me know if you feel we should comment.

646,"The CAISO recently filed Amendment 30, which would provide the CAISO with
the authority to engage in forward contracts/purchasing, etc. to meet
reliability requirements.  This filing is in response to the language in the
FERC San Diego Order which suggested that the FERC believes the CAISO should
have this authority.  Clearly, this raises issues about the role of the
CAISO in the forward markets as a policy matter, but FERC is likely to
approved this authority anyway.

The CAISO Board is addressing this matter as part of its Comprehensive
Market Reform Project.  The CAISO Board at the September 7 meeting deferred
the issues of the 2-day ahead market (as well as the policy matter of the
CAISO buying forward) until the October meeting.  However, later during
Executive Session, the CAISO Board apparently approved Amendment 30.

At this point in time, IEP is not planning on responding to Amendment 30.
This position is primarily driven by limited funds in the
Restructuring/Transmission Task Force account and, given the forces aligned
in support, taking this issue up seem problematic.  Please let me know if
anyone differs with this assessment and would like to see IEP comment
(recognizing that funds would be required to accomplish this).

649,"Additional Talking Points 

1. Grace Period for Direct Access

Customers should be given at least the next 6 months to contract away from 
the Utilities w/o any penalty.


2. Fees must Promote Direct Access

Any fees that are charged to switching customers should be of a fixed nature 
(reset annually) and have a long-term amortization (10 years).


3. CDWR needs to have incentives to minimize cost and should have some Risk / 
At a minimum, need Sunset language

Without the right incentives, CDWR may not make the right decisions.  Need to 
push this into the market as quickly as possible.


LANGUAGE CHANGE --

As much as possible, remove the "", including the payment of fees or 
surcharges, "" language in the middle as it seems to be covered by the last 
sentence.  I don't want to invite surcharges"

659,"Utilities' Demand Blocks Bailout 
NEGOTIATIONS HIT SNAG: PG&E, Edison want end to price freeze if they sell 
transmission lines to state David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, March 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/21/M
N114450.DTL 
California's near-bankrupt utilities are demanding that higher electric rates 
be a part of any deal to sell the state their power lines, The Chronicle has 
learned. 
A rate increase -- perhaps of more than 50 percent, according to earlier 
industry estimates -- would certainly draw a firestorm of protest from 
consumer groups and force Gov. Gray Davis to backtrack from earlier pledges 
that rates would remain unchanged. 
Nevertheless, sources close to negotiations on the deal said Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison are attempting to make higher 
rates a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell 
the state their transmission systems and some land. 
The sources said the talks hit a new snag this week when state officials 
realized that fine print sought by the companies could require the Public 
Utilities Commission to pass along all of the utilities' costs to ratepayers. 
The sources said this would end a rate freeze that shields consumers from 
runaway wholesale electricity prices. 
The inclusion of potential rate increases in the talks reflects the growing 
complexity of a deal originally intended by Davis to stabilize the finances 
of PG&E and Edison so banks would resume loans to the cash-strapped 
utilities. 
The negotiations subsequently have expanded to involve a state purchase of 
the utilities' transmission networks and acquisition of utility-owned land, 
including spectacular coastal property near PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear 
power plant. 
Now they also have embraced further deregulation of California's 
dysfunctional electricity market. 
""Clearly, one of the terms being discussed is the regulatory environment,"" 
said Joseph Fichera, head of Saber Partners, a New York investment bank that 
is advising Davis in the talks. 
""The past situation has not worked well,"" he added. ""The utilities want some 
certainty about their future."" 
TENTATIVE DEAL WITH EDISON
To date, the governor has announced a tentative agreement with Edison for the 
state to buy the utility's power lines for almost $3 billion. Discussions 
with PG&E for a similar accord have dragged on for weeks. 
An Edison official, asking that his name be withheld, acknowledged yesterday 
that an end to the rate freeze is an expected result of the power- line sale. 
""Once the details of the pact are complete, dominoes will fall,"" the official 
said. ""One of the dominoes is the rate freeze."" 
A PG&E spokesman declined to comment. 
In fact, both Edison and PG&E have been aggressively seeking an end to the 
rate freeze for months. 
The two utilities have a lawsuit pending in federal court demanding that the 
PUC immediately raise rates so the utilities can recover almost $13 billion 
in debt accrued as a result of the freeze. 
""They have been trying a lot of things to get the rate freeze ended in 
various forms,"" said Carl Wood, who sits on the PUC. ""Adding it to the 
present talks is consistent with past behavior."" 
Wall Street has taken note that the negotiations no longer appear to be 
making progress. 
Paul Patterson, an energy industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, 
told clients on Monday that the discussions ""may have lost some momentum in 
recent days."" He did not give a reason. 
For his part, the governor sounded unusually cautious about the course of the 
talks when asked late last week if a breakthrough was imminent. 
SECRET STICKING POINTS
""We are going to take the transmission systems and the land that's deeded, 
and we will work out an agreement,"" Davis said at an appearance in San Jose. 
""But there are a number of sticking points in the talks with PG&E that I'm 
not going to reveal."" 
One of those sticking points apparently is an insistence that the sale of 
utility assets include a long-sought lifting of the rate freeze. 
Sources said lawyers from both PG&E and Edison had inserted the related terms 
into draft accords affecting each utility, and that the full impact of the 
additions was not realized by state officials until this week. 
One source said the language was just convoluted enough to slip beneath the 
radar screen of state negotiators. But the upshot, once the words had been 
parsed, was that the PUC effectively would lose control over power rates. 
CREDITWORTHINESS ON THE TABLE
In Edison's case, the terms of the tentative deal include the governor asking 
the PUC ""to support the creditworthiness"" of the utility. 
""This would ensure that future investments in both utility distribution and 
utility generation plants are provided fair returns of and on capital, 
consistent with current authorized returns and capital structure provisions,"" 
it says. 
Sources said the provision could be interpreted as a guarantee from the state 
that Edison would be permitted to recoup all outstanding costs from 
ratepayers. 
""There may be some assumptions about this language that the rate freeze ends 
if it is adopted,"" the Edison official said, adding that he saw no reason to 
disagree with such assumptions. 
But Fichera, Davis' adviser in the talks, insisted that nothing is set in 
stone, and that the negotiations are proceeding without a hitch. 
""This is a very complex transaction,"" he said. ""God and the devil are in the 
details.""

660,"Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action 
FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River 
Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the 
natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were 
happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. 
""The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is 
something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort,"" but the 
""precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword,"" warned 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although 
she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC 
""should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action."" 
Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action 
expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the 
""extraordinary regulatory treatment"" that the Commission gave it. Critics 
claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler 
Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she 
noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. 
""...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in 
the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how 
our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing 
electric generation in California this summer,"" Breathitt said. If anything, 
she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even 
worse than it is. 
There should have been a ""fuller airing of this issue"" at FERC before the 
project was certificated, she noted. ""It would be counterproductive for this 
Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without 
ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets "
661,"you didn't send me the version of the PP presentation that you sent Rick and 
Steffes on Friday.  To work on it, I need a copy.  Can you send it when you

662,"Thanks.

FYI.  The Negative PX Credit language in the MOU reads (on p.31):

""the CPUC Implementing Decisions shall include

Orders resolving the responsibility of SCE to provide credits to direct 
access customers in respect of electricity deliveries after December 31, 2000 
in respects which do not result in any material financial detriment to SCE; ""

Could go several different ways, but arguably could be read to say that SCE 
will make good on credits up to 12.31.2000.  If that were the case, I'm 
assuming that about 75-90% of our exposure would be covered?

Best,

663,See email. All comments compiled/integrated.  Final just sent.  Jeff
664,"FYI.  Bob Williams should be touching base with you; or it would be useful 
for you to touch base with him.  Edison appears to be staking out it's 
negotiating position with us through their filing.  

In short, they ""recalculate"" the PX credit post-Jan. 19 (when DWR took over 
procurement).  That recalculation turns our $125 MM dollar PX credit claim 
into $63MM.  So we're pretty far apart.  

We agreed at this point to oppose the filing and say:

1) through the end of the rate freeze, or end of 3.31.02, the status quo 
remains--""PX credit"" based on market price (Dow Jones index).
2) however, if you want to go ""utility purchase"" price as the basis for the 
credit, then it must be the utility's full cost of power (retained 
gen+QFs+DWR+ISO real time).
3) negative credit during the transition can still occur.
3) Edison's proposal should be rejected.

675,"The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those ""involuntarily"" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the ""effective date"" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

"
676,"Apologies for missing the call yesterday.  As I'm sure you're aware, yesterday the PUC voted to suspend electric direct acces in California.  As a result, it was an extremely hectic day.  I do intend to make the weekly calls.

Best,
Jeff"
677,"thank you.

"
678,"The call was pretty tough. 
Quick side bar:  Edison is very concerned about TURN getting a stay from the court on the EIX/PUC settlement .
At the start of the call, Fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the TURN appeal, but based on how the call went, I'm not sure if he'll send it. 
As we conjectured sometime back, Edison is indeed talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our ""share"" of the undercollection.
Our ""share"" would be paid down through a reduction in the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years).
In short, with one hand Edison would pay us what they owe us; with the other hand, Edison would take it back.
Edison intends (as we conjectured) to base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percentage of load they represent (e.g., if DA is (was) 10% of the load, they would pay for 10% of the undercollection).
We had a very ""animated"" discussion that went back and forth for some time.  
I told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track.
Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid.
Here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by COB today or tomorrow and tell us what Edison's calculation is of our ""share"" of the undercollection.
We can discuss further on the call that Wanda's setting up for tomorrow.

If you have any questions between now and then, 	give a holler.

Best,
Jeff"
679,"Well, we had the right person handling the call, that's for sure.

Best,
Jeff

 "
680,"Couple thoughts.  Understanding that we're really trying to get this thing done and that there's a million different ornaments one could hang on the tree (and bring the thing toppling down), I'll just throw this out for consideration.

Seems that as a first-order issue, the judge is either going to approve the settlement or cede to arguments the PUC could make regarding its exclusive ratemaking authority--that is what it is.
Assuming that the judge sides in our favor, there remains the chance that the PUC could take the Edison view and charge DA customers for the undercollection, thereby taking back what we achieved in the settlement based on the way our deals are structured with our customers.
It would help alot if PG&E took the position at the PUC that (for a variety of reasons) the PUC should NOT tack on DA customers' bills any charges designed to pay down the utilities' undercollection.
In a proceeding where Edison and PG&E are on different sides, our chances of prevailing are of course much better.
But it likely won't do much good if we have any such deal written explicitly in the settlement document (i.e., PG&E agrees to take our side at the PUC).
But if there's any way to do some sort of side deal, outside of the settlement agreement, and if PG&E were amenable, there might be some real value.

Again, I know we want to get this thing wrapped up, but thought I'd toss it out there.  We can take it or leave it.

Best,
Jeff"
681,"Very quick and dirty--not even fully proofed.   But wanted to get something out for folks to shoot at.  Let me know your thoughts. Sure I've missed about a million things and mucked up about the same amount.  Happy Thanksgiving.

692,"
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"
700,"Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

702,"All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

710,"Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull.... in the 
company we would be a $100 stock.

On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the 
current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager 
promotion  for the typical associate including timeline.  This process 
mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.

I think radical change is not the answer.  The answer lies in a combination 
of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key 
points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible 
key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where 
necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the 
program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet 
commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.

The goals of any restructuring are:
 a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the 
business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the 
program;
 b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained;
 c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling 
and interviewing;
 d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly 
grounds the associate in the ""Enron technology"" which include skills in 
market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk;
 e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding 
talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them 
up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the 
program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues;
 f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, 
retention and performance tool;
 g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, 
non-traditional sources of talent and
 h) increase cost effectiveness.

The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, 
people and teams, business tracks, etc.

I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the 
key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the 
least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.

I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with 
a strawman.

Let me know your thoughts.

with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very 
important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to 
gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their 
associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs 
real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and 
project costing are negatively impacted.
 
We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at

Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry 
periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE)

THOU SHALT NOT SKIM FLAVOR FROM THE HOLIDAYS 

By Craig Wilson, USA TODAY 

I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced 
frivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out 
with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the 
holidays without gaining 10 pounds. You can't pick up a magazine 
without finding a list of holiday eating do's and don'ts. Eliminate 
second helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies made with butter, 
they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say. Good grief. Is your 
favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot stick? I didn't think 
so. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you left for Rudolph. 
I have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you 
follow them, you'll be fat and happy. So what if you don't make it to 
New Year's? Your pants won't fit anymore, anyway. 

1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on 
   a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In 
   fact, if you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where 
   they're serving rum balls. 

2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine 
   single-malt scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than 
   single-malt scotch. You can't find it any other time of year but now. 
   So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's 
   not as if you're going to turn into an egg- nogaholic or something. 
   It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Have two. It's later than 
   you think. It's Christmas! 

3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of 
   gravy. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill 
   it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat. 

4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk 
   or whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a 
   sports car with an automatic transmission. 

5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control 
   your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat 
   other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college? 

6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New 
   Year's. You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. 
   This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the 
   buffet table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of 
   eggnog. 

7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like 
   frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position 
   yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before 
   becoming the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of 
   shoes. You can't leave them behind. You're not going to see them 
   again. 

8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. 
   Or, if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. 
   Always have three. When else do you get to have more than one 
   dessert? Labor Day? 

9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the 
   mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, 
   have some standards, mate. 

10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the 
    party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention. 
    Reread tips. Start over. But hurry! Cookieless January is just 
    around the corner.

"
812,"Effective immediately, there is a change to the Stack Manager which will 
affect Inactive Children.

Inactive Children with links to Parent products will not have their 
calculated prices updated until the Child product is Activated.

When the Child Product is activated, the price will be recalculated and 
updated BEFORE it is displayed on the web.

This means that if you are inputting a basis price on a Child product, you 
will not see the final, calculated price until you Activate the product, at 
which time the customer will also see it.

817,"I realize this is short notice, but I would really like for you all to attend 
this meeting from 2:30 to 4:00 or 4:30 pm tomorrow at Bridgeline's offices.  
Their people are trying to get up to speed on the systems and the business.  
Most are accountants from Texaco, and there is a common theme - they think in 
accounting deadlines, after the end of the month, and most do not have 
experience with a trading business.  I assume they have experience with the 
asset world.  I am sure they are very capable employees, but they have so 
much on their plates, and we can help.  I realize that we lost some time 
today with the system outage as well as it is the end of the month.  However, 
we will never migrate our services to their infrastructure if we don't get 
this moving.  So I would like to do a ""chalk talk"" tomorrow with them - very 
simply, starting at ground zero.  We need to explain Sitara, CPR, TAGG and 
ERMS as well as Unify and POPS.  The perspectives need to be very clear 
also:  Marketing, Onsystem Pipeline and Offsystem business.

I know that Mike, Daren and Rita (I think) will be there.  Tommy Yanowski 
will be there also.  If possible, I would like Mary, Pat and Lisa to join us 
also.  Steve, we will not do an in-depth discussion of Risk as Jay came from 
ENA, and they are not a mark-to-market company.   We will cover this more 
from an accrual basis.  So I don't think your time would be best utilized, 
but you are more than welcome if you want to attend.  Mary, I think your 
background and system knowledge will be beneficial even though you have not 
been involved in the Bridgeline transactions.  Pat, it would be helpful for 
you to be there to provide any insight you might have, but I know it will be 
tough for both you and Daren to be gone.  Exercise your judgement.

Please let me know ASAP if you can swing being there.  I know it is 
difficult, and the room will be tight, but I appreciate any support you all 
can provide.  I will be in and out myself.  Thanks in advance for your help.

829,"Sandi, 

Sorry for just now getting back with you.  I was out last week.  

The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated 
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.  The fee will 
be adjusted yearly based on CPI.

Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the 
delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).  I think we should use actuals 
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a 
daily basis.  We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to 
purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at 
the 45,000 base.  I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they 
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.  Do 
you agree with this?

Can yuou get with Rebecca on this?  It seems like we took care of this

"
831,"We did take into account the price adjustments you made.  The actual purchase 
cashout for 8/00 was $118,103.67.  Your pricing took care of most of the 
cashout, but there was still a balance.  The over delivery pricing per MMBtu 
in the contract is the difference between HSC Spot - 0.05 and HSC Index, so 
GD - 0.10 didn't quite cover the entire cashout.  I have attached the calc 
sheet in case you need it.

I believe the best way to enter the fee into Sitara would be as a Demand fee 
in your example #1. 
If we do the fee this way, we will not  double up the volumes.

I have attached my spreadsheet for support:
THE MOST CURRENT WORKSHEET IS TAB #2 MARKED FINAL


Column G is the Over-Delivery quantity total is 17,278 mmbtus
Column S is the Daily dollar amount for the over-delivery quantity due HPLC

886,"Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

891,"Greetings Everyone --

You may have noticed that your paycheck stubs reflect vacation and sick leave 
balances that are inaccurate.  Due to EWC being acquired mid calendar year, 
and GE ""grandfathering"" in our vacation levels, the balances as stated on 
your check stub will differ from your actual balances.  So, for the balance 
of this calendar year (2002), all vacation and sick time balances will be 
tracked locally on our own HRIS System (at GE Wind in Tehachapi).  

Human Resources will provide you with your true balances by the following 
method:

The first of every month Human Resources will print out a hard copy of your 
vacation and sick leave balances.
Employees located in the North and South Tehachapi facilities will be able to 
pick up a hard copy of their balances from their respective facility 
receptionists.
Remote site employees' balances will be mailed to the respective Site 
Supervisors for distribution.

Thank you for your continued understanding through the integration process.

Since you are the only required attendee, I have not reserved meeting rooms at this point.  I think all the 17th floor rooms are pretty well booked anyway.  I was thinking we could meet in your cube to discuss these companies on the given dates.

890			11/26
986			11/29
1095			12/5

003 			12/13 (these are both divisions of 367)
1700			12/13  


In addition to these companies, I have the following tentative dates planned for my 4's:

Company #		Date

1573			11/26 (the same day as 890.  both are divisions of 985)

1407			11/28

1688			12/18
1690			12/18
1691			12/18
1699			12/18

"
898,"I reviewed the latest draft of AA's management rep. letter and caught a few  
innaccuracies in the way AA described the deal.  I attach a revised draft of 
the letter, with a redline version to highlight for you the changes I think 
we need to make to keep it accurate.  First, AA only listed two of the four 
agreements that comprise the deal.  They apparently forgot that we had 
created a second SBA.  Additionally, at Transcanada's request, we put the 
transaction fee into a separate letter agreement this year.  You will recall 
that last year, Sempra wanted the transaction fee put right in the SBA.  

Second, AA's bullet no. 4, as originally drafted, states that Northern does 
not intend to enter into an option to purchase any base gas during the term 
of the agreement.  That statement is confusing given that Article VI.B of the 
Monthly Pack Agreement includes an account balance cash out mechanism that is 
a form of purchase option.  That cash out mechanism was in Kent's bullets 
describing the deal and has been in every draft of the documents that AA 
looked at, so I assume they are OK with the mechanism and were just inartful 
in drafting bullet no. 4.   My simple fix was to leave AA's language alone 
but to add an ""except for"" reference at the beginning of bullet no. 4.    

Third, AA's draft of bullet nos. 5 and 6 includes the somewhat ambiguous 
references to ""other agreements"" and ""additional agreements"" respectively.   
Since AA's list of the agreements in the intro paragraph was incomplete, 
these references in bullet nos. 5 and 6 were also innacurate.  Now that I 
have made the list of agreements in the intro paragraph complete, I've 
clarified the bullets by adding the ""other than those agreements referenced 
above"" language to both bullets.  The couple of other changes in bullet 5 
simply clarify the meaning.  

Finally, I've modified the signature blocks per conversation with Bill to 
delete MKM and myself.  I am certainly willing and able to sign this letter, 
but MKM is not up to speed on the deal and has not reviewed the agreements.  
Getting her up to speed enough to sign the letter would take some time.  
Additionally, Bill's thought was that MKM and I are his direct reports 
anyway, so it doesn't serve much purpose to have the subordinates sign if the 
top guy has signed.   

Please give me a call if you have any questions or want to discuss these 
matters.

899,"Please see attached.


"
900," First, congratulations to all five of you and the others on your staffs who 
were involved for working together to get the excess line pack deal done 
today.  As I understand it, TK was able to sell 10,000 MMBtu at the Cal 
Border for something like $15 thanks to your efforts.  This thing went from 
Dave and Kent's idea to you guys' execution in about two days, even with a 
(slight) delay due to my panic attack on whether we can make downstream 
sales.   Great job!   Second, I think TK, Kevin, Maria and Glen and I have 
come up with a workable set of guidelines on when similar deals can be done 
in the future.  The key, as I expressed in the attached email, is that the 
sales be driven by a legitimate operational basis.  If Gas Control verifies 
that we have excess line pack at a location and that making the sale helps 
get line pack to optimal levels, such sales are appropriate.  Gas Control 
should also verify that the operational basis for the sale can be documented 
if the need ever arises.  Today's deal is a great example of that as we 
actually communicated to outside parties that we anticipated some pressure 
management issues.  If there are ever any questions about when such deals are 
appropriate, or about how to document the operational basis, please give me, 
Susan, or Maria a call.  Again, great job!  DF

"
903,"Here is the draft letter agreement.  We are still discussing it with ECS and 
can make whatever changes are appropriate.  Note that the letter agreement 
ties back to Article 6 of the Compression Services Agreement.  That article, 
you may recall, is where ECS agreed to create a computerized system that 
would monitor Continental Divide's electric system utilization and warn when 
their system peaks were occurring and then automatically take the compressor 
offline (subject to manual override) so we and ECS could avoid peak period 
demand charges.  Instead of creating such a system, which apparently turned 
out to be mostly a manual system anyway, ECS is going to pay us a monthly fee 
to monitor CD's system peaks ourselves and decide when we need to get off 
line.  The load management service has to do with operational management of 
the load we place on CD's electric system, and is not a jurisdictional gas 
transportation or storage service.  Note that the service goes on for 10 
years (as required by the accountants' 10 year amortization rule) and thus 
may be vulnerable to scrutiny and potential revenue crediting in TW's 2007 
rate case.  Any way to avoid that?  DF

914,"As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some 
reading and here are my thoughts.

The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission 
ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the 
Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  
Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that ""any rate, 
charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, 
regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or 
classification"" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the 
just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, 
or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain 
areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but 
""fixed"" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California 
governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of 
wholesale electricity prices is questionable...

In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate 
the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its 
authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly 
authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just 
and reasonable.  ""Just and reasonable"" has been interpreted in many different 
contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.  
As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.  
However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 
above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated 
rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and 
unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire 
communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their 
electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous 
across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's 
transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices 
and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not 
widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer 
issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have 
already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just 
about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do 
need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the 
same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of 
monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew, 
obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a 
more in-depth report.

However,  I am concerned that we do not have recommendations for the OTC regarding divestitures.  I would think we would want to sit down with Andy and Jeff and go through the inventory of companies in order to put a divestiture plan in place.

I would like to get a feel from the OTC of how much pain they are willing to accept to sell down some of these assets.  The schedule that Louie handed out the other day may have been a good start but I doubt all of that can be accomplished within the 2002 time frame.

946,"At Third Current Estimate, we added a full year forecast for MGT for Operations and added the MGT and Border amounts together on the Border page in the ETS Functional Income Statement as instructed.

We are trying to confirm what we should be reflecting.  Jason is being instructed that ETS should not pick up any actuals for January through May, and that we should use Actuals received from El Paso for June forward, and not our numbers.  The El Paso amounts for June through September are close to what we have, but not exact.

Please advise us as to what we should be reflecting and we will revise our schedules.  We did not pick up MGT at all until 3rd CE, so I'm OK with restating 3rd CE to reflect the appropriate amounts for MGT and rolling forward from there.

 Yes, the deal needs to be input into Sitata.  Maybe, Terry can input.  Wade 
has copies of the monthly invoices from T & F Operating for all three months.

Deal details:
Volume = 10,000 MCF per month
Price for Jan, Feb & Mar = $3.465 / MCF
I would not worry about the Mcf issue here.  Just put the volumes and price 
in and pay the bill.

955,"Can you answer Melba's question below regarding the new desk?
"
956,Hi Team!  I just extend CNG deal 116090 through 1/31/2001.
957,"Per Chris' memo below, it appears to me the question we need to be asking is 
this:
Was this contract number from CES (columbia gulf k#64502) valued in the 
original deal?  Originally Chris was told that this contract was a volumetric 
FT contract, when in fact it is a 100% demand charge contract.  Since it is a 
deal tied to the Devon production, I don't know how (or if) it was valued by 
us.  Theoretically, we could have taken the difference between the max IT 
rate (which is what we get to deduct from the producers' price) and the 
amount of the demand + variable cost of the FT contract and MTM'd $$$.   Did 
we do this?   If we did, then I believe we have a true up issue with CES.  If 
we did not value anything, then I think we are O.K.   

Please advise.

995,"Why Exercise???

1) My grandmother started walking five miles a day
 when she was 60.
 She's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she
 is.

 2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so
 that I could hear
 heavy breathing again.

 3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 400
 bucks. Haven't
 lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up.

 4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain
 figures out what
 I'm doing.

 5) I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch
 our toes, he
 would have put them further up our body.

 6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken
 by people who
 annoy me.

 7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach
 covers them.

 8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you
 die healthier.

 9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing,
 start with a small
 country.

 10) I don't jog. It makes the ice jump right out of
 my glass.

The price on deal 511820 should be $4.7012 not $4.8041, just corrected in

1010,"CES was billed $1,597,000 in demand reimbursement for 6/00 prod.  Can you 
split this amount between East and MktEast?

Thanks!"
1011,"Dynergi released the CGAS capcity to us for one month so we could do it non 
bidable.  Scott, it looks recallable.  Its parcel number 28464.  Vol=7500, 
receipt point is Leach, delivery point is City of Richmond.  The rate is 
$2.40 = $.08.

Everything looks good except the recallable factor.



Also, there is a small NYSEG release for 24 dt's at max rate, offer #28446.  
I can't get my machine to print out the forms.

Good Luck."

Congratulations.  Welcome back.  I sent you a note and a spreadsheet with the

start over and book the deals you tell me to.  I just need the exact terms.

1077,"I finished a spreadsheet for calculating historical correlations on forward curves. It gives the correlation matrix for contracts going out an arbritary number of months out. I think it might be a handy tool for some of you.

You may get that on O:\RESEARCH\CUSTOM\CORRELMATRIX\

It demands that you have access to our EGSPROD32 database. You must have that configured in your ODBC. It is a large spreadsheet, so it may take some computing resorces. Let me know if you find any problem.

We have been aware of this project for some time and have watched it with 
interest.

Questar just (within the last month) bought the development rights fully from 
Beta Energy.  They have drilled one salt test well and have extensively 
tested the salt.  They HAVE NOT tested the disposal zones as yet and that is 
a critical component.

They are planning on developing four caverns for a total of 14 Bcf working 
gas. First caverns should be available in about 2 years.  At that time they 
will abandon the three small reservoirs on their system and replace the 
deliverability and services with the Yellow Creek Facility.

We have initiated conversations with them regarding providing base gas as 
well as horsepower.

Please describe in detail, the downstream capacity available to transport

1115,"Hello traders!

This e-mail is a request regarding counterparties EES and MPC.

Please pay careful attention to the columns from which you are pulling MW and 
price information when you build the worksheet that we send to EES.  We have 
had some recent discrepancies that could have been avoided if the correct 
information had been sent to EES. 

Also, our checkouts with Montana Power Company are getting out of control.  
We are off with them 9 days, totaling 19 deals for the month of February.  
Many of these discrepancies are from deals that were spoken, but not recorded 
in Enpower nor in the INC sheets.  I understand that we do many deals a day 
with MPC and a few may go un-recorded, but it's getting to be too many.  
Please remember to at least put these deals in your log and in the INC sheets.

One final request is that you state the hour when you make trades by phone.  
Tapes are irrelevant if we play them for the counterparty and there is no 
hour stated.  It also makes it difficult for us to pull tapes when necessary. 

Thanks for your responses to my requests in the past.  If you have any 
questions regarding any of the above, please come see me.

Thanks,

Virginia"

And

Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference

January 22-25, 2002, New York City, NY

 

OVERVIEW

 

In the current environment of volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk. EUCI presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).

 

The brochure for the Electricity Risk Management 101 Workshop and the Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference can be obtained by clicking on the link below:

Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference

Feb. 5-8, 2002, Miami, Florida

OVERVIEW

 

This conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO initiatives.  The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.

 

The brochure for the Conference and associated Workshops can be obtained by clicking on the link below:

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins."

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

1167,"From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has 
three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power 
(under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power 
transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from 
its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission 
capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get 
capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO 
gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.  

I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was 
wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to 
write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get 
Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more 
difficult for him to balance his budget.  

The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there 
would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply  trying 
to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also point out 
that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's 
Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency and that 
this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have a just and 
reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the power.  I wouldn't 
bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power transactions.  I don't 
think we want to encourage that.

What do you think?  Call me."

1170,"Energy Infrastructure Crisis in  the West
June 25-27, 2001, San  Francisco, CA
Presented by: Infocast 


[IMAGE] Concerns  regarding the price and availability of electricity have 
brought an urgent  call from state governments, regulators, utilities and 
consumers  throughout the West: Build more power plants, and build them 
quickly!  However, as natural gas prices scale to new heights and with the 
electric  transmission system contributing to power outages in San Francisco, 
it has  become clear that the problem is more complex, and that plant 
developments  alone won't resolve the power crisis in the west. While it is 
clear that  something must be done, and done quickly, it is not nearly as 
clear what  the right combination of ""fixes"" is. What is the most 
cost-effective  solution to the energy shortfall?  

This conference, Energy Infrastructure Crisis in  the West, will offer a 
comprehensive view of the shortcomings  of the current energy 
infrastructure--generation, natural gas pipelines  and storage, electric 
transmission-and how these shortcomings might be  addressed through 
development. You will hear from legislators, regulators,  and state officials 
how they are encouraging the development of new energy  infrastructure, and 
from developers and utilities what it will really take  to quickly respond to 
infrastructure needs. Specific issues that will be  addressed include:  

Legislative, utility and consumer views on how to solve the energy  crisis  
Developing new generation--what should be done to expedite the  process?  
Electric transmission bottlenecks--can a solution be quickly found?  
Beefing up the region's natural gas infrastructure--comparing  pipeline and 
storage expansion proposals 

If you are considering  the development of energy assets in western power 
markets, attending this  conference is your best opportunity to learn about 
the prospects for  success. Plus, don't miss our exciting half-day 
pre-conference workshops  ""Economic Evaluation of Quick Fixes to Local Power 
Supply Problems"" and  ""Establishing Demand Response Programs that Work"".

? Conference Call on Monday, April 2nd at 2:00 p.m. (EDT)
? Comments Due April 3rd

On February 28, 2001, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a request for 
information regarding the outcome to date of the different regulatory and 
legislative approaches states have taken to the introduction of retail 
electric competition.  The FTC is examining various state retail competition 
programs to determine which features have resulted in consumer benefits, and 
which have not.  EPSA's comments do not answer every question in the 
Commission's notice, but instead take a broad view of competitive markets to 
date.  A draft copy of EPSA's comments is attached for your review.

Comments are due at the FTC on April 3rd.  We will discuss the attached draft 
during our West region conference call on Monday, April 2nd at 2:00 p.m.

Your list does not appear to address the issue of RTO liability for
costs caused by issuance of invalid operating instructions.  This issue
is very important to the parties (generators and Scheduling
Coordinators) who will be obligated to comply with the RTO Tariff.

I've raised this issue several times now at RRG meetings, but it
apparently has not yet taken hold at the Legal Work Group.

I have not been able to raise the issue at the meetings of your subgroup
because of conflicts with other NWRTO meetings, and I will not be able
to attend your future subgroup meeting (again, due to conflicts with
other NWRTO meetings), so I've attempted to frame the issue through the
attached, hastily-drafted issue paper.

Please contact me if you need additional explanation of the concerns
stated in the paper.

Thanks,

1197,"For all of you who are active participants in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, 
we have made arrangements with Northern Trust, our Plan Administrator, to 
expedite any loan requests made during the week of June 18 - June 29 in order 
to help you during this recovery period from any flood damage you may have 
experienced.

If you do not already have an outstanding loan, you can request up to 50% of 
your balance up to a maximum of $50,000.  To request a loan follow these 
three easy steps in order to ensure quick processing:

 1. Log onto the website:   https://www4.rsweb.com/61045/# or call the 
Benefits Service Center at 713.853.7979.

 2. Enter your SSN and your Personal Identification Number and click on ""Loan 
Information"" to see the amount available.
 If you wish to request a loan, click on ""Loan Modeling/Request"" and follow 
the instructions.

 3. Checks will be mailed from Northern Trust in Chicago  on June 27 for 
loans requested the week of June 18 - June 22  and on July 5 for loans 
requested June 25 - June 29. 

NOTE:  The IRS restricts Hardship Withdrawals to specific circumstances 
outlined in the Money-in-Motion guide on the benefits website.  
Unfortunately, while we know the flood has imposed hardships on many of you, 
these circumstances do not qualify for a withdrawal.

1204," FERC's notice of PSNM's complaint about the PX's application of its default 
chargeback procedures can be viewed at this link:

 http://cips.ferc.fed.us/Q/CIPS/ELECTRIC/EL/EL01-43.000.TXT

 - EL01-430.url"
1205,"The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no 
day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should 
post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at 
this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is 
fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to 
base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides 
the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission 
is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability 
to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or 
zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY 
City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined ""proxy 
buses.""

While Kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect 
congestion revenues (rather than an obligation, similar to the PJM FTRs now), 
the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the 
establishment of the real time energy market.  Regulatory people should use 
their judgment (and talk with the desk) when determining how far to push 
option-type flowgates, rather than obligation-type FTRs.  Such a physical 
market transmission/congestion market can support a financial trading overlay.

If you do have an FTR type system, there should be an upfront allocation to 
load.  Ideally, the load should have an ""network"" right from the generator to 
their load (or from load to the ""hubs"") in order to have the ability to 
manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use 
customers (EES) or for the ENA full requirements deals.  The nodes should be 
grouped into logical ""zones"" and congestion within a zone should be uplifted. 
This allocation to customers (or full blown auction of all rights) becomes 
critical in Enron's ability to serve load and all requirements customers.  
Without the proper allocation (not to incumbent utilties), the risk premium 
to serve these customers becomes too high and can't be priced. 

Finally, the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market 
like NEPOOL (prefer PJM's system where the load has to show the RTO that it 
has contracted for enough reserves.)  We have urged the FERC in Florida to 
adopt a reserve monitoring system, whereby customers are not penalized for 
lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement, then they 
are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they 
demonstrate continued compliance.

Bottom line -- ""Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.""  Congestion 
does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is 
done in a manner that precludes Enron and others from developing efficient 
real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the 
generation (supply) and the load (demand).  This type of market will provide 
greater services to customers and allow Enron to grow its business.  

Finally, as we work toward this goal, remember that in the absence of a 
real-time energy market, we need to continue to focus our efforts on 
non-discriminatory treatment with respect to transmission (no native load 
exception) and parking and lending, scheduling flexibility, etc."
1206,"Mary, I am working with Jeff Golden and Marc Pana in EES Corporate 
Development. Marc asked me to send you a list of potential substations for

1207,"Attached please find a revised version of the revised version together with a 
redline version of the proposed complaint.  We have incorporated many of 
Bracewell's changes but our approach, on behalf of Sempra Energy Trading, is 
to state the legal argument first (that the CalPX's use of the tariff is 
wrong) followed by the equitable argument that its doing so was unjust and 
unreasonable.  We feel that this presents a stronger argument for retroactive 
application.

The ETS Operations Administration and P&SM organization will support all of 
the objectives listed below in whatever manner we can. but I feel that we can 
be most directly involved with the last one:

9).  E-Commerce Strategy

 We can work with the GSS organization to develop an E-Commerce Strategy and 
proceed with implementation.   Some specific areas that we need more 
development and implmentation of is the use of :

 ""Payment on Receipts""  this eliminates the further processing of vendor 
invoices related to approved purchase orders.

 SAP Auto generated Purchase Orders.  - When we have designated NPA 
agreements in place for specific commodities, let the system convert the 
requisition to a purchase order and route to our preferred Supplier.

 Use of reverse EDI - allows vendors to input verbal orders to them into 
their Purchasing System and reverse create a ""Purchase Order"" into our SAP 
System.

 An E-Commerce system that can be implemented  anywhere within the Enron 
world that provides for a quick seamless transaction from ""Cradle to Grave"" - 
Requisition to Payment"".

 Our implementation of an ""Integrated Supplier"" is allowing us test ground 
for many of these applications with an outside Supplier partner.

I would like to see a first draft of the 2001 goals & objectives by December 
11, 2000.

I specifically would like to see goals dealing with the following:

1.) Resolution of the Navajo Right -of- way issue;
2.) Development of a specific business plan for NNG's South End;
3.) Timetable for TW's new expansion;
4.) Timetable for the completion of FGT's Phase IV, Phase V, and PhaseVI;
5.) Pipeline safety legislation;
6.) Divesting of Enron's clean fuels business;
7.) Business developments efforts;
8.) NNG's Equivalent Unit Risk account  (how do we get our money back now !); 
and,
9.) E-Commerce Strategy.

1248,"Rod:

I took the liberty of summarizing my 14 1/2 years of work at Enron.  Either you can use it in your discussions with Andy or I can (if we feel it becomes necessary).  I get the sense that Andy (and Ben for that matter) may have lost sight of my contributions to the company.  I thought this might help clear up a few things.  I was a little ""fuzzy"" pre-1992!  I would be more than happy to discuss this with you prior to a meeting with Andy.  

Thanks,

Kevin

1263,"Guten Morgen!!!

How was your weekend?  We had the long Memorial Day weekend here....hahaha!

Things are fine here.  I just tried to relax this weekend.  Friday night I =
went to a movie with Rayfael. We saw Angel Eyes with Jennifer Lopez.  It wa=
s pretty good.  Saturday, I pretty much just vegged out a good chunk of the=
 day.  Julie and I went to lunch and ran errands.  I went running every day=
 this weekend, too!  I've lost 10 lbs since the big breakup!!!  Down to 145=
 now, may go for 140 - not sure.  I didn't go out on Saturday because I was=
 just in a mood to stay in.  Sunday, I took care of some stuff around the h=
ouse.  I wasn't really planning to go out, but one of my new friends, Kevin=
, called and wanted me to meet him and some other folks out at a bar, so I =
went at about 9:00.  Well, you know how 1 or 2 drinks always turns into alo=
t more...I ended up staying there pretty late and having a good time.  I cr=
ashed at Kevin's house and got back to mine at about 7:00 am.  So all the w=
ork I'd done on getting caught up on sleep was ruined!!!  I came home and g=
ot right in bed, but the dogs really wouldn't let me sleep much.  I went ov=
er to Julie's yesterday to get instructions on taking care of her cats this=
 week.  She leaves Wednesday for Prague and gets back next Thursday.

Now it's back to work, but it's a short week at least.  I'm getting more an=
d more used to the fact that I'm single now, and even though I'd like me an=
d Rayfael to get back together - it's nothing I'm gonna be able to push, if=
 it happens, it happens.  I really hope it does, but the best thing for me =
is not to push it.  So, in the meantime, I guess I'm a free agent!  That fe=
els weird...but, oh well.

Anyway, how are things there?

The blonde's boyfriend figures that he's pretty good at puzzles, so he heads

puzzle spread all over the table. He studies the pieces for a moment, then he 
studies the box.

1267,"Hi, 
 in case you need to know.....
The Spring/Summer 1999 Hard Copy Enron Phone Books - may be the last paper 
phone book we'll ever have for Enron.     So, if some of the common numbers 
or unchanged information is helpful to you, please keep your book.

Per Facilities, there is a task force to see if the On-line book can be 
redesigned to better incorporate the international offices, as well as stay 
up with all the Enron changes.

FYI - Enron is currently having approximately 500 employee changes - per week.
Per Facilities, it is due to both the growth and the moves.

Thanks,
Sandy"

Vepco offered out in the 40's to 50's.   SOCO, OPC  will be on the bid for 
Monday.  TVA was offered power in the mid 20's to mid 30's with no

1280,"Pursuant to our discussion yesterday regarding the above, please find below for your consideration a suggested revision to MAC/Credit Rating trigger definition to used in all future master trading agreements or confirmations in which Enron Corp's credit rating is part of a MAC/Credit Rating trigger.

""Material Adverse Change"" means (i) with respect to [Enron Trading Entity], Enron Corp. (or its successor or its successor's parent company) shall have long-term, senior, unsecured debt not supported by third party credit enhancement that is rated by S&P below ""BBB-"" [also insert Moody's as appropriate];

I understood yesterday that we may also need to consider changing the definition of Credit Support Provider in the ISDA's. I suspect that if ""Credit Support Provider"" is defined as Enron Corp. in the relevant Master, then the corresponding changes noted above would also need to be made. Your further thoughts regarding this issue are welcomed.

Please provide me your comments to the above language by tomorrow so we can start implementing a revised definition in our agreement templates.

"
1292,"Stan,

Thanks for the fax from Mike McGrath.  The only structure issue that I need
some further clarification on is electric retail vs. wholesale.  To the
extent GISB moves in the direction of retail gas standards, would we
consider the same split?  I must admit that it seems overly cautious in
terms of avoiding one sector driving another.  Balanced voting, super
majority rules, etc. would avoid the need for three or possibly four units
under the EISB umbrella.  Pipelines have been willing to live with other
segments having a voice in wholesale gas standards based on the balanced
structure and vote rights established when the organization was created.  If
you can shed more light on this I would appreciate your thoughts.

 Attached are the two transactions that result from spliting the original 
deal.  Please advise Crestar that they need to revise the assignment document 
to reflect an agreement for Transaction No. 1 dated March 22, 2001 instead of 
March 5, 2001 and they should provide for a complete assignment of that 
Transaction No. 1. Document 2001-23acrfm relates to Transaction No. 1.  Don't 
you agree?  If you agree, please print off 2 originals each and send one of 
each to Crestar, and email a copy of each to Bob Bowen for his Confirm 
Records.

Dan - does Enron need to sign the assignment again or acknowledge that the
existing assignment agreement will suffice? Either acknowledge by replying
to this e-mail or e-mail to state Enron need to sign the agreement again.

Kelvin - I believe the attachment below will be the final version for BP. I
would attach this document with BP's ""package"" to be sent to your US

1310,"After reviewing the proposed Master Gas Purchase Agreement, I had one concern 
regarding the Price provision. Under Section 7.1(b) & (c) reference is made 
to the ""Index Price"" used for deliveries made in excess of the Scheduled 
Amount and for deliveries less than the Scheduled Amount. 

The definition of  Contract Price used in our Transaction Agreement defines 
the price as . . . equal to the ""Index Price"" published in Inside F.E.R.C.'s 
Gas Market Report for Texas Gas Transmission Zone South Louisiana (large 
packages only) as listed in the table entitled ""Delivered Spot-Gas Price"" in 
the first-of-the-month issue of such publication for each Month during the 
Period of Delivery plus $0.0025 per MMBtu.

My concern is that there may be some confusion as to what the Index Price 
actually is.  The Index Price has always had the meaning of the First of the 
Month Published Index.  I'm sure the intent in the Master Agreement is for 
the Index Price to equal the published Gas Daily Spot Price for that 
particular location. 

I think that changing the wording from Index Price to Spot Price would save 
some confusion."

1315,"I have a proposed restructuring transaction with City of Mesa, Arizona.  It 
works like this:

1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with 
us)
2) That deal runs through July 01
3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to 
finance a discount to index for an extra six months.
4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the 
volume one extends the full volume.


       

I need help with a couple of things:

1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal 
that will allow us to transact without it.
2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system

1326,"Fred, as a follow-up to our telephone conversation, we would like to launch 
some new products on EnronOnline -- swaps on coffee, sugar and cocoa (the 
agricultural ""softs"").  We would like to know if Canadian law presents any 
sort of restrictions or other issues with respect to financially settled 
derivatives on these commodities.  We would like an analysis with respect to 
both swaps and options (however, if timing becomes an issue, we should 
concentrate on swaps, as our offering of swaps is more imminent).

We are looking at rolling out with nine products -- for each of the three 
commodities, there will be a calendar-month swap tied to (i) the New York 
Board of Trade price, (ii) the LIFFE price, and (iii) the spread between the 
two exchange prices.

We would like the results of your analysis by April 27.  Please feel free to 
call me with any comments or questions you may have.  Thank you for your 
assistance with this -- Bob Bruce

1342,"I just got off the phone with someone at PP&L and I am trying to coordinate 
our response to assigning our physical gas, physical power, financial and 
online transactions.  Per my discussion with PP&L, Shari is working on the 
physical power assignments, Stacy has received the gas assignments, which in 
it includes an assignment of the online account, and the woman at PP&L is 
faxing me an assignment of their financial positions with us.  PP&L tells me 
that we have recevied Credit approval of these assignments, although I have 
not received such approval.

With respect to assigning their online account, I don't know if Frank has any 
particular issues, my only issue is that we don't only assign an account, in 
doing so we assign all trades under that account, and if the only trades done 
with PP&L are physical gas, power & financial, then we should be alright (if 
Frank is ok, in consenting to the assignment of the online account).  It 
seems to be a problem with her in opening a new account.

Saying, all that, I guess I need to know if (1) Credit has approved all these 
consents, (2) when power & gas have consented, and (3) if Frank is OK with 
assigning the online account over..."

operator approvals can only be done by the two seatholders, who are currently

Thanks for responding and sorry about you having to repeat this again as I 
was not aware of your previous discussions.  In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA 
Collateral Opinion, they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify 
the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor/creditor relationship between the 
parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge.  
Do you have any thoughts on this?  Is this an alternative that we should 
consider implementing with some of our more persistent high volume 
counterparties who are giving us a hard time about not being able to post 
cash collateral to us?

Tuesday, April 10, 2001 ? ?

 
 

Dear continental.com customer,



We're Changing To Serve You Better
This Thursday evening April 12th 2001, we are launching a new version of our 
web reservations system, eService Online.  This marks the start of an 
exciting new beginning as the reservations platform is 100% provided by 
Continental.

We're making this change because our current product, while good, will not 
provide us with the flexibility in the future to offer the features that will 
make travel arranging easier and to tailor the online Continental experience 
for you.


Here's What You Need To Know:

Your Profile
Your profile information, including your username (tanajones) and password, 
has been transferred to the new version of eService Online.  To protect your 
personal information, credit card information has not been transferred.  You 
will need to update your profile.

Your Itineraries
Information on your reservations created before April 12th will not be saved. 
If you want to keep a copy for your records, you will need to print them 
prior to 9pm/CDT April 12th.  This change does not affect the status of any 
previous reservations and tickets, but you can not view them in the new 
eService Online.  

Signing In
To enhance security, you will have to sign in for each transaction session to 
reserve and purchase flights.  This means you will have to use your password 
each time.  To have your password e-mailed to you click here.  You are 
strongly encouraged to sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging 
process. 

24 Hour Hold Option
To prepare for this Thursday's release we will be turning off the ""Hold for 
24 hours"" option.  The ""Hold"" option will not be available between April 10 
and April 12.


Here Are Some of the Changes

More eTicketing
The new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets 
(eTickets).  We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by 
Northwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West 
Airlines (CO2000-2349). 

Aircraft Seat Maps
We rearranged the seat map pages for easier viewing. We also enhanced the 
seat selection process and enabled Elite-status available seating. 

Pricing 
The pricing system is enhanced to deliver more current fares based on your 
selection of either ""Search By Lowest Fares"" or ""Search By Schedule.""  We 
also added a gold star to denote ""continental.com promotional fares,"" so you 
know for certain when you receive a discounted, online-only airfare. 

Customer Service 
Our customer service is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now 
handle all support for online inquiries and reservations services. 

While we've made a number of improvements to the overall experience, this new 
version may not, on the surface, appear to offer significant benefits.  These 
changes lay the foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for 
the future.  We welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  
Based on feedback from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.

Overall, we're confident that you will appreciate the changes and 
improvements and look forward to continuing to serve you in the future.

Sincerely,
Continental Airlines Inc.


This is a one-time update e-mail.  You have been sent this e-mail as a 
registered eService Online user to inform you of this change in service.

If you have questions or comments, or you would like to unsubscribe please

1384,"Hi

I just found your e-mail and decided to see if you actually read
them.  Actually I also have a request.  I want to put your name down
as having talked to you about a job at ENRON.  This is for my
unemployment benefits.  They theoretically say they can call contacts
but they never have.  Anyway, anyone I talk to about whether a job
might be available in their company is appropriate.  I will put down
that there is nothing available for me, as I assume would be the
case.  It looks like I will get the job at Landmark.  I will probably
be coming down for training soon.  I'll keep you posted on when.

1385,"As you are painfully aware, we had a power outage Wednesday morning in the 
Enron Building.  This outage was caused by localized structural failure of 
the raised floor in our 34th floor Data Center.  This resulted in disruption 
to the power distribution system servicing the phone switch and a number of 
ENA servers.

As a cautionary move, Enron OnLine was interrupted while the extent of the 
failure was assessed, resulting in the system being unavailable from 11:23 to 
11:39.  All Enron Building telephones and voicemail were unavailable for 
approximately one hour and 20 minutes and certain ENA trading systems were 
unavailable for over two hours.  During this time the power was stabilized 
and systems were restored.  Immediate steps are being taken to correct this 
problem.

Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of:   
Foreign Exchange

Confirming Entity:  Enron North America Corp.

Governing Law:   New York

CONFIRMATIONS:  There is a special form of confirmation that should be used 
for all online and offline transactions.

RESTRICTIONS:  This is a TEMPORARY bridge master agreement until we can get a 
new ISDA Master Agreement in place.  In a side letter agreement dated 
3/19/01, the parties have adopted the Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. 
ISDA Master Agreement dated 12/02/92, in effect changing the names of the 
parties and certain credit terms."
1395,"Sheri,

I need the trade date so I know what to date the termination."
1396,"Several things are not very clear to me and I need to run them by you.

1.  From your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason 
prohibiting your Australian based counterparties from trading all of the 
products we offer, however, except for financial Australian power, the 
contracting Enron entity will have to be the party referenced on the 
particular product.  It appears that the only product Credit has currently 
opened the Australian based counterparties to trade anyway is Australian 
financial power.

2.  Will you be approving the Australian based counterparties for trading?   
Dave Forster appears to want me to approve Australian based counterparties 
too, which doesn't make sense to me and Mark Taylor.  What are your thoughts 
on this? I guess EnronOnline just does not want a third Legal contract they 
are going to have to deal with on an ongoing basis.  FYI,  I currently do not 
approve the London based counterparties.

3.  The Australian company number.  Does that have to go on every 
confirmation done with an Australian counterparty?  If it does we will need 
to make sure that it gets put on every confirmation.  It is my understanding 
that the confirmations for online trading will be generated from Houston so 
we will have to provide every company number to the Houston Confirmation Desk.

FYI, tomorrow at the end of the day is my drop dead time to get all the 
counterparies approved, because the information will have to be loaded in by 
London when they arrive for work Friday morning."

1404,"Sandeep:  Vince has asked me to coordinate with Margaret Daffin in our 
international group to ensure that we acquire an L1 visa for Anshuman.  This 
visa has to be in place before he will be able to work in the United States 
in any capacity.   (Anshuman cannot work in the US on a B-1 visa--he can only 
come here for business meetings or training.)  There are still several items 
remaining to be completed for the L-1 process.  The first is a fairly 
detailed job description for Anshuman.   Secondly, we will need to know 
whether or not he will either be in a managerial position or whether he will 
be managing a project while he is here in Houston.  Vince thought that you 
would be best able to provide this information to us, and we would really 
appreciate anything you can do to help us expedite this process.

1409,"Winston and Jin,
for last half year the following developments were implemented by Jin for 
vatrfacs code
(the calibration code for VAR):
1. Weighting the log-returns with exponential decay factor while calculating 
correlations;
2. Calculating factors and correlations for UK curves;
3. Joint estimation of factor loading for selected groups of commodities;
4. Alternative method for collecting historical data for correlations 
calculation 
(based on fixed contract instead of collecting prompt, prompt+1, etc. prices)

In order to release these developments Research has to have each version under
Clearcase. Then we will:
1. Run  vatrfacs code in stage environment (stage has been refreshed 
recently). 
2. Run VAR code in stage and validate the results.

It is time to start releasing these 4 versions. Projects 3 and 4 require some 
experimental runs
in stage. A few traders (in Gas, Power and Liquids markets) are expecting the 
results.

Meanwhile the following developments have been suggested by Reseach, approved 
by Risk Control,
submitted to IT as spreadsheet prototypes and waiting in line:
1. Volatility blending for intramonth power positions;
2. Forward volatility smoothing and extracting forward forward volatilities;

Hope we can follow our procedures to make all these developments go smoothly 
and efficiently.

Tanya."
1410,"Shijie,

Additional   changes.

Abstract:

The power market developments in the US have created several unique
challenges for energy industry economists. We discuss the major factors 
underlying
the exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices. We feel that some of
them may reflect the flaws in power pools design and incomplete transition to 
fully deregulated markets in
generation and transmission.


The title is fine.

Thanks for a prompt reply. I am not planning any particular trip to Houston
yet. For the time being, I am about to leave for London, and then Poland. I
will most likely be at the Olympics in Sydney in late September, and in NY
in early October. Mid-October could be the first realistic opportunity to
visit with Enron, although I am looking forward to seeing you sooner in Palo
Alto. I am simply curious whether and how we could leverage together core
competencies and connectivity that both our companies seem to have or are
developing.

I am Senior Vice President for Visa USA, responsible for strategy and
planning. I would probably bring with me (though I haven't discuss it yet)
people in charge of our network or/and our COO.

I'm the Territory Manager for the MathWorks, we develop MATLAB technical

Enron has used our products in the past, but all of those end-users have
left Enron.

Risk Management and Research groups at Southern Energy, TXU, Dynegy, El
Paso Energy, Koch, Calpine, Reliant and others have recently started using
our products in the following ways.

1. Create sophisticated option pricing models, risk analysis models, and
stress analysis models. Creating GUI front ends for the end-users.
2. Pull in Data from ODBC, Corba, and SAS databases to evaluate.
3. Visualize the results and quantify the solution.
4. Compile these models and distribute these applications to their
Traders, Analysists and Managers with no distribution costs.

Who should I contact at your company to discuss Enron's situation to see if
our can help Enron as it has with our other Energy customers?

that his transfer is not an issue for the time being.

We can put it on a back-burner till he gets here.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such

 This email is in reference to your vmail regarding my rescheduling my

 They have asked us to take some time to evaluate Moody's Riskcalc software.

1437,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***

  Business; Financial Desk 
  Sempra Still Feeling the Heat Energy: The parent firm of 2 Southern 
California
  utilities is weathering criticism from all sides, with more flare-ups on 
the horizon. 
  NANCY RIVERA BROOKS 
    
  09/17/2000 
  Los Angeles Times 
  Home Edition 
  Page C-1 
  Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company 

  Sempra Energy just can't seem to get out of the hot seat.

  First there was the controversial 1998 merger between the parents of San 
Diego Gas &
  Electric and Southern California Gas, which created the Sempra Energy 
holding company
  and gave it more customers--21 million--than any other utility company in 
the nation.

  Now, although the calendar says autumn is less than a week away, warm 
weather still has
  Sempra sweating through a summer of electricity discontent. And winter 
doesn't look like
  much fun either for Sempra or its natural-gas customers, with residential 
gas bills projected
  to increase 30% to 35% without fueling anything above a strictly regulated 
rate of return for
  Sempra's gas utilities.

  Hanging over the San Diego-based energy company is a new uncertainty 
generated by the
  turmoil in California's restructuring electricity industry. Of particular 
concern to the
  investment community is a rapidly swelling debt caused by the difference 
between the high
  wholesale cost of electricity and the freshly capped retail power rates for 
the 1.2 million
  customers of San Diego Gas & Electric.

  Who will pay that debt--Sempra Energy's shareholders or SDG&E's electricity
  customers--and how big it will grow may not be known for years. The answer 
will hinge in
  part on an investigation of SDG&E's conduct by the California Public 
Utilities Commission.

  In the meantime, Sempra Energy, whose two utilities serve nearly 7 million 
gas and
  electricity meters representing about 21 million customers from Central 
California to the
  Mexican border, continues to post sparkling earnings largely because of its 
non-utility
  businesses. Sempra wants to be much more than its utilities, pushing into 
energy trading
  and electricity and natural-gas contracting outside of California.

  Indeed, Sempra has stressed that recent profit surges came not at the 
expense of its
  California utility customers. Consumer advocates are not persuaded, 
painting Sempra as a
  profit-hungry company that has not done enough to protect ratepayers.

  Despite all the tumult, Sempra's previously languid stock price has risen a 
bit this summer,
  a fact that appears to amaze even Stephen L. Baum, Sempra's new chairman 
and chief
  executive.

  ""Maybe it's all the publicity we've been getting,"" he recently quipped, 
ruefully.

  It's a careful-what-you-wish-for proposition for Sempra Energy, which spent 
hundreds of
  thousands of dollars in the last two years to boost its corporate profile 
by, among other
  things, becoming a sponsor of Staples Center and rolling out a new logo 
that looks like a
  small flaming man. Now the corporation and its San Diego utility are 
puzzling over how to
  repair an image so scorched that angry residents in SDG&E's 
4,200-square-mile territory
  covering the San Diego area and southern Orange County have taken to 
verbally and
  physically abusing company employees.

  ""This has been an agonizing time for all of us,"" Baum told the Federal 
Energy Regulatory
  Commission at a hearing Tuesday that is part of an investigation into this 
summer's
  gyrations in the California wholesale electricity market. ""SDG&E takes 
enormous pride in
  serving this community with safe and reliable electric service at, what 
were until recently,
  just and reasonable prices.""

  Although regulators themselves, not to mention consumer advocates, warned 
of looming
  shortages in power supplies, no one predicted this summer of sky-high 
prices during which
  wholesale electricity prices jumped fivefold and bills doubled for SDG&E 
customers, the
  first in the country to pay free-market power prices.

  That produced a ""Ratepayer Rebillion""--so dubbed by Michael Shames, 
executive director
  of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers Action Network, a longtime SDG&E 
sparring
  partner. The shock waves quickly reached utility regulators and state 
lawmakers, the
  architects of electricity deregulation , who are still scrambling for 
solutions.

  ""SDG&E has become the corporate equivalent of the gang that couldn't shoot 
straight,""
  Shames said. ""They have the distinction of having the market blow up on 
them in a very
  visible way . . . and I'm quite convinced they didn't have a clue how 
customers were going
  to respond.""

  This high-voltage atmosphere visited the San Diego area because SDG&E did 
such a good
  job selling its power plants, as required under deregulation . The 1996 law 
that launched
  the overhaul of California's electricity world broke the industry into 
three separate
  businesses: companies that make electricity, companies that distribute 
electricity and
  companies that sell electricity directly to consumers and businesses.

  SDG&E and the state's other big investor-owned utilities--Edison 
International unit Southern
  California Edison and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric--lost their 
secure monopoly
  status. They were deemed to be electricity distribution companies 
only--though still
  monopolies in that segment of the business.

  The utilities handed over their long-distance transmission systems to a new 
nonprofit, the
  California Independent System Operator, and were required to buy their 
electricity from
  another new nonprofit, the California Power Exchange. The utilities 
remained the default
  provider for customers who didn't pick a new electricity retailer, but they 
were required to
  pass along the cost of electricity with no markup.

  Electricity rates for consumers and small businesses were frozen until the 
utilities paid off
  their ""stranded assets""--investments in nuclear power and renewable energy 
contracts that
  became unprofitable under deregulation --or until March 2002. Rates are 
still frozen for
  SCE and PG&E customers, but SDG&E customers lost that protection in July 
1999, after
  the San Diego utility sold its power plants to eager buyers who were 
willing to pay much
  more than book value.

  The rapid payoff surprised even regulators, who had developed no 
post-freeze rules. The
  California Public Utilities Commission allowed SDG&E to maintain a 12% 
ceiling on prices
  for the summer of 1999 and recoup any excess electricity costs later. 
Thanks to a cool
  summer and a smoothly functioning wholesale market, the ceiling was little 
employed.

  This summer, however, no ceiling was allowed by the PUC as part of its 
original post-freeze
  order, SDG&E executives said. And prices on the California Power Exchange 
began
  behaving strangely, spiking higher and higher even in the middle of the 
night when demand
  was low.

  San Diego-area electricity users began seeing ""true market prices from a 
market that's
  dysfunctional,"" Baum said. ""Of course I wish we had foreseen this market 
spike. We
  didn't.""

  Consumer fury has been calmed somewhat by a new law that caps electricity 
prices for
  SDG&E residential and small-business customers at 6.5 cents a 
kilowatt-hour, compared
  with the 21.5-cent peak this summer. Who will eventually pay the 
electricity costs above
  the cap, currently collecting in a balancing account, is left unclear by 
the legislation.

  It could mean a big balloon payment for customers, or some of the costs 
could be shared
  by SDG&E if a PUC investigation finds that the utility didn't act in the 
best interests of its
  customers in buying electricity. A companion bill that would use $150 
million in taxpayer
  funds to defray some of the costs passed the Legislature but has not been 
signed by Gov.
  Gray Davis.

  ""I don't think that we did anything wrong,"" Baum said. ""This is a bum rap 
that has been
  hung on us, on SDG&E, that we somehow mismanaged the power supply for our
  customers.""

  PUC officials and consumer advocates have criticized SDG&E for not 
""hedging"" more by
  buying ahead of time when prices are relatively low, for example. SDG&E 
said that it asked
  the commission for such authority but didn't get it. What's more, Baum 
said, SDG&E found
  better prices for its customers than did SCE or PG&E, even though they have 
broader
  hedging ability.

  SDG&E will have to borrow money to pay for the electricity, since 
ratepayers aren't paying
  the full cost. SDG&E says the under-collection of electricity costs could 
eventually top
  $800 million, whereas sponsors of the rate-cap bill put the total closer to 
$150 million.

  The future debt and the unsettled state of the deregulation process in 
California were the
  reasons given when Moody's Investors Service recently changed the credit 
outlook for
  Sempra and SDG&E to ""negative.""

  Shareholders can't be happy with Sempra's stock price, which fell from a 
high of about $28
  a share right after the 1998 merger between Enova and Pacific Enterprises, 
which was
  loudly opposed by consumer advocates because of the market clout a merged 
company
  would wield, to a low of $16.63 in April. Sempra bought back 36.1 million 
shares at $20
  each in February and lowered the stock dividend to $1 a share from $1.56 a 
share. The
  stock closed Friday up 14 cents at $20.14 on the New York Stock Exchange.

  Baum acknowledged that the company has lagged in return to shareholders, 
blaming that
  partly on a turning away by investors from utilities and other old-economy 
companies to
  Internet and other new-economy stocks.

  Sempra wants to be much more than its utilities and has made some promising 
inroads
  into unregulated areas, such as energy commodity trading, 
telecommunications,
  power-plant building and the sale of electricity and natural-gas to 
consumers and
  businesses in other states, Mexico, South America and Canada, analysts said.

  In fact, Sempra Energy Trading, which buys and sells electricity, natural 
gas, oil and coal,
  earned more money in the first quarter--$3 million--than in all of 1999. 
That subsidiary's $40
  million in second-quarter earnings was primarily responsible for Sempra's
  better-than-expected income for the period of $110 million, or 55 cents a 
diluted share, up
  34% from the second quarter of last year.

  Analyst Paul Fremont of Jefferies & Co., who has a ""buy"" rating on Sempra, 
notes that the
  trading company income will be volatile and that the other subsidiaries 
remain unknown
  quantities.

  ""They've really got to have sustained growth in that [unregulated] part of 
the business
  because there's not a lot of growth in the utility part"" in California, 
Fremont said.

  Sempra's earnings growth during this electricity furor has consumer 
advocates fuming even
  though company executives emphasized that electricity trading gains came 
from the East,
  not California.

  ""Consumers don't need to feel sorry for this company,"" said Mindy Spatt, 
spokeswoman for
  the Utility Reform Network, also known as TURN, a San Francisco-based 
consumer group.
  Spatt noted that Sempra's new El Dorado power plant near Las Vegas ""did 
very well""
  selling electricity in Nevada and California during most of the second 
quarter.

  ""We don't think consumers should be responsible for the failures of 
deregulation , and we
  think that Sempra is in a much better position to pay for some of these 
costs than the
  average San Diegan,"" Spatt said.

  Sempra has had some problems in reaching beyond its California utility 
origins. One
  subsidiary, Energy America, which sells electricity and natural gas door to 
door in six
  Eastern states, has run afoul of regulators in two states because of 
aggressive sales
  tactics that prompted complaints from consumers. The company has been 
variously fined
  and ordered to retrain salespeople.

  Sempra is on track to reach its goal of reaping one-third of its earnings 
from its
  non-California businesses by the end of 2003 and to increase overall 
earnings by 8% to
  10% compounded annually in the next four years, Baum said.

  That success is whipping up customer ire.

  ""People tend to look at Sempra-SDG&E as a monolith. . . . People are 
saying, 'They're
  making a ton of money here. That company is doing very well. We're getting 
screwed, and
  we don't like it, and why should we have to pay for it?' "" Baum said. ""It's 
a very natural
  reaction. People don't understand, and they don't care to understand.""

  One of SDG&E's immediate concerns is fixing relations with its customers. 
Baum said the
  utility recently polled customers and found that 9% considered it credible, 
down from 35%
  (""which is not much to brag about, but it's not bad in the utility 
business"") before the
  electricity crisis.

  ""I don't know that a corporation can do very well with a credibility rating 
of 9% on a
  sustained basis. That is something I worry about,"" Baum said.

  SDG&E President Debra L. Reed said most customers don't understand that the
  investor-owned utilities are now only distribution companies, despite a 
$90-million education
  campaign by the Public Utilities Commission.

  ""They see our name on the bill and they think we're making money on the 
commodity,""
  Reed said. ""We have a lot of education to do with our customers. But we 
realize that it is
  probably not the best time to educate them in the middle of what they see 
as a crisis. . . .
  What we're trying to do is help them through this.""

  Is Another Energy Crisis Ahead?; Winter Fuel Costs Will Rise; After That, 
Nothing Is
  Certain

  This winter the mailman will be delivering markedly higher heating bills 
throughout much of
  the country, including the Washington area.

  Those who use natural gas--the dominant heating fuel in the Washington area 
and
  throughout the United States--face a 27 percent increase. Heating oil 
customers,
  particularly in the Northeast where 35 percent of homeowners use the fuel 
to warm their
  houses, may have to pay more than $2 a gallon--twice the current price--as 
the days grow
  shorter and temperatures plunge.

  Motorists get hit in the wallet every time they pull into a service 
station: They now typically
  pay more than $1.60 a gallon for gas, and the days of 90-cent-a-gallon 
gas--yes, it was just
  last year--are but a distant memory. At least that's better than in 
England, France and
  Belgium where motorists are waiting in long lines to buy $4-a-gallon gas, 
only to find that
  some stations have run out.

  Is this the start of an energy crisis?

  Many energy analysts and government economists say not, that supplies of 
various forms
  of energy will prove sufficient over the next few months, but that the 
costs will continue to
  follow the law of supply and demand. When there's not an excess of a fuel 
available--and
  numerous types of fuel reserves are quite low--consumers will likely think 
the product costs
  too much, at least compared with the prices they've been accustomed to 
paying.

  But as winter approaches, several loosely connected events that spanned the 
globe over
  the past couple of years have heightened awareness of energy in our lives 
and reminded us
  of a lesson learned in the 1970s: Energy prices can be volatile, 
unpredictable and can
  reverberate throughout the economy.

  As Philip Verleger Jr., a partner with the Brattle Group, a Cambridge, 
Mass., economic
  consulting firm, concluded, ""Consumers will have to spend more on energy. 
They will have
  less to spend on other things.""

  On top of the triple-whammy of higher natural gas, heating oil and gasoline 
prices,
  consumers are also vulnerable to the vagaries of the electricity market 
because the industry
  has been in the midst of deregulation .

  While California and other states have struggled with power prices during 
the adjustment to
  the new competitive environment, electric utilities locally have maintained 
stability.
  Potomac Electric Power Co. says its 621,000 residential customers in the 
District and
  suburban Maryland--about 15 percent to 20 percent of whom heat their homes 
with
  electricity--will find their bills about 5.5 percent lower this winter, 
assuming they use the
  same amount of electricity as last year. Across the Potomac River,Dominion 
Virginia
  Power's customers in Northern Virginia are likely to see their bills stay 
about the same.

  Much of the current energy pricing is out of consumers' hands, analysts 
say, because the
  United States has chosen, to a large degree, to remain dependent on oil 
pumped out of
  distant lands controlled by OPEC nations.

  The 11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last 
weekend to
  increase its oil production by 800,000 barrels a day in hopes of pushing 
the price down to
  $28 or so. Even so, oil prices hit a new 10-year high on Friday, closing at 
$35.92 a barrel
  amid worries about tensions between Iraq and Kuwait. These are prices not 
seen since the
  days of the military buildup before the Persian Gulf War in November 1990.

  Analysts say that 21 months ago, when oil was below $10 a barrel and 
natural gas was at
  $2 per 1,000 cubic feet, drilling companies, many of which produce both 
fuels, began to
  curtail their exploration as a result of dwindling revenue.

  The OPEC nations cut their production at the time to force prices 
upward--and now they
  have more than tripled. Private exploration for more natural gas in the 
United States, chiefly
  in the Gulf of Mexico and several southern and southwestern states, only 
grew after drillers
  concluded that the demand was significant enough and they had sufficient 
capital to look
  for more.

  Peggy Laramie, spokeswoman for the American Gas Association, the 
natural-gas utilities'
  trade group, said the low price of gas at the time contributed to a feeling 
by producers that
  there was plenty of supply, so they cut back on drilling for about nine 
months, from August
  1998 to April 1999. Fewer than 400 rigs were drilling at the time, although 
now that figure
  has topped 800.

  With little new natural gas exploration, the flow through the supply chain 
slowed, of course,
  even as demand increased in the United States, Europe and Asia.

  The result was predictable: Higher natural-gas prices at the wellhead and, 
over time, bigger
  bills for consumers. The $2 wellhead price has now risen to $5. Laramie 
said the last time
  wellhead prices were this high was in 1985.

  As Verleger said, ""Demand was growing. We didn't pick up the supply 
and--whoops, there's
  a problem.""

  In the Washington area, where perhaps 70 percent of all homeowners heat 
with natural gas,
  Washington Gas Light Co. estimates that its residential customers will see 
the typical
  monthly bill jump $26, to $112.50, in the November-to-April period, a 27 
percent increase
  over last winter.

  Laramie said the gas utilities' trade group believes that with the renewed 
exploration, natural
  gas prices ""will be moderating by spring, but we don't want to 
over-promise.""

  The price of oil and its derivative products is expected to remain 
volatile, depending on a
  host of factors, including demand by consuming nations, the severity of the 
upcoming
  winter months after a string of three relatively mild winters, and how much 
more oil OPEC
  nations might decide to produce if prices stay high.

  This mix of factors leaves the analysts, OPEC and government economists 
using a lot of
  ""ifs"" and ""buts"" and ""possibilities,"" but mentioning few certainties.

  OPEC President Ali Rodriguez predicted this past week that oil prices could 
reach $40 a
  barrel this winter, even if only for a relatively short time.

  ""Crude oil prices are very high and will remain very high throughout the 
rest of the year,""
  said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research 
Foundation, which is
  funded by oil companies. In terms of gasoline, a shortage is unlikely, ""but 
prices will be
  high,"" he said. ""It can go back to $1.40 a gallon because of more 
production and lower
  crude prices. It won't start right now, maybe later this year or early next 
year.""

  But with heating oil, he said, an unusually cold winter in the Northeast 
could bring about
  problems, given low inventories. ""I don't see a shortage, but prices will 
be very high.""

  Verleger was less certain.

  ""We do have a problem,"" he said. ""I think we're going to see high prices 
this winter for
  heating oil and natural gas. But I'm not certain about it. I'm not willing 
to go out and say it's
  going to be awful.""

  With oil prices at record levels, President Clinton last week came under 
increasing
  pressure to tap the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, nearly 570 
million barrels of crude
  oil stashed at four sites in Louisiana and Texas.

  The reserve is intended for use in cases where the president determines 
there is a national
  supply emergency. High prices alone do not qualify. The White House says 
all options to
  combat the current low reserves of various fuels and high prices are under 
consideration. In
  the past, however, the oil reserve has been tapped to combat mechanical 
breakdowns in
  the oil industry's pipeline system or to trade lower-quality oil for a 
better grade.

  ""If the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is released, that would knock $15 a 
barrel off the price,""
  Verleger said. ""One piece of news like that and this [crude oil price] will 
drop like a rock.""

  At least for the winter months, electric utilities generally have found a 
way around the high
  price of oil and natural gas that some of them must use during peak-demand 
periods in the
  summer to generate electricity. They're able to focus their winter 
generation on cheaper
  fuels--coal, nuclear and hydroelectric power.

  ""That's cheaper fuel and fuel that's less subject to the volatility of the 
world oil and world
  natural-gas markets,"" said Chuck Linderman, director of energy generation 
and supply
  policy for the Edison trade group. ""Generally we're in good shape on 
supply.""

		Time to Move On  
		BY JOHN FUND  
		
		
		Democrats Mistook Static for  Votes 
		Robert Blohm - Princeton, New Jersey 
		
		Last Saturday's Miami-Dade court-recount, under a strict standard,  
reportedly favored George W. Bush. In other words the higher quality the  
vote, the relative greater likelihood it was for Mr. Bush. This accords  with 
testimony a week earlier before Judge Sauls by Gore's Quebec  statistician, 
Nicholas Hengartner. He depicted that ""new"" votes  ""recovered"" in the Broward 
County manual recount of rejected ballots were,  even under that county's 
less strict standard, biased toward Mr. Bush  relative to the votes before 
the manual recount: Mr. Bush had 34% of the  new (i.e. ""recovered"") votes, 
versus 31% of the votes before the manual  recount. 
		
		The three Florida Supreme Court wise men last Friday  fixed on two tradeoffs: 
speed vs. accuracy, and (higher) margin of error  vs. (lower) margin of 
victory. When it's hopeless to pin down an exact  number, the trend becomes 
everything. And the trend, the stricter the  standard, has been toward Mr. 
Bush. 
		
		You had to include overvotes  in any statewide recount, which includes 
optical ballots as well as  punch-card ballots. While punch ballots have a 
higher undervote rate than  optical ballots, it's the reverse with overvotes. 
Why? If you only touch  both candidates' spots with the stylus (leaving no 
mark) or a pencil  (leaving a mark), what registers as an undervote on a 
punch ballot  registers as an overvote on an optical ballot. 
		
		Undervotes can be  non-votes, or low-quality votes which may vary in quality 
with the voter's  mental ability. There is a level of mental ability below 
which voting  behavior is noise, unintelligible, unpurposeful. The issue was 
where you  set the cut-off point, and ignore incompetence. 
		
		The Democratic  Party has a practice of assigning no cut-off point, as if 
rounding up  derelicts to cast meaningless votes. It's as if Mr. Gore was 
trying to get  elected by assigning purposefulness to incompetents, in the 
face of  evidence that competence was biasing votes toward Mr. Bush.

1465,"Randy,

1.  The following is an update re contacting local counsel to review the IM
sections dealing with regulations:

Brazil- I have spoken with Jose Amelio Pinto and Maria Elissa with Tozzini's
firm.  I e-mailed to them last night excerpts from the IM dealing with the
regulations of the Brazilian projects. They have agreed to review the IM
regulatory sections for most of the projects (Elektro, CEG/Riogas, Gaspart,
and Cuiaba I) by today or tomorrow.  They did not work on Cuiaba II or III,
RioGen, or Puerto Suarez and consequently stated that in order to perform
the review, they would have to review all of the documents.  They are
attempting to track down names internally of the firms and attorneys that
worked on those projects.  Do you have any recommendations on who to contact
on these projects?

Argentina - Dr. Jose Martinez de Hoz.  Have called (and continue to call)
two numbers last night and this morning, and have left messages on
non-descript voice mail boxes.  No response.

Bolivia - Ramiro Guevara Rodriguez - Have called six numbers all night last
night and this morning, and have neither reached a person nor a voice
mailbox.  Other numbers/suggestions?

2.  Attached is a doc request list from Tozzini's firm for the completion of
their ongoing review of the Brazilian projects.  They stated that they will
most likely be unable to complete this review until Thursday or Friday due
to the amount of documents and to the fact that they still require more
docs.  Attached is a document request list.  We have already sent all of the
documents in the VE data room.  Can you recommend someone at Enron for us to
contact to fill this request?  I will cc Robert George on this e-mail in
case he has any thoughts or someone he knows who can help respond.

3.  At  Steve Kean's request, we aim to have an update on the status of the
local counsel reviews being performed in the various countries for Project
California.  We will include you on that update.

Please contact me at (713)758-3374.  Regards,
Donnie

1466,"Attached, please find a letter from Assembly Minority Leader Dave Cox to
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg outlining what the Assembly
Republicans want in exchange for the clean-up legislation to ABX 1 which
is necessary in order for the state to sell its bonds.

1467,"I would hold off for now.  I think, based on our discussion, that Ira might 
be a fit for my organization or EES.  Unfortunately, I am heading out of town 
with my family on the 12th (unfortunate for meeting with Ira , not 
unfortunate for me) and EES has new leadership who is trying to assess the 
state of things before making new senior level hires.  So, let's wait a bit.  
Thanks



"
1468,"Steve,

I mentioned that my brother, an attorney in New York, is active in state 
politics and might be a useful contact in the state. I'm following up with 
this note to let you know a bit more about him. 

Larry Mandelker is a partner with Kantor, Davidoff Wolfe Mandelker & Kass in 
New York City. He is outside counsel to the Republican State Committee and 
represented Bill Powers when he recently joined the Crane Group in Albany. 
Larry works closely with the Crane Group's legal operation, Crane Green & 
Parente, in many state matters.

There's another reason why I thought to mention Larry. He currently 
represents Sunset Energy Fleet, a company managed by Jerry Montrose, which is 
negotiating to win state permits for barge-mounted generation off of Brooklyn 
as well as gas supply contracts. He knows exactly what the power industry 
faces in New York.

If anyone would like to contact him, I'll forward that person's name to him. 
I'll give you his telephone number, too --
212-682-8383 x 30 -- if you'd like to file it away.

Please let me know if there's any additional information you'd like to see.

Take care,
Jeannie"
1469,"ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

I just spoke with ELena Schmid, VP, CAISO.  She said the ISO report and FERC 
filing should be on the web site ""soon.""

Speaking matter-of-factly, she said that their ""60 days"" was about to expire, 
so they felt they ""had"" to file at FERC to tell FERC they need more 
information.  She said the filing asks to extend the 60 days (the 12/15/00 
FERC order had said that, after 60 days to review the pricing for sales above 
the cap -- no refunds would be required).  She said that, primarily, the 
filing asks for a Technical Conference, which the ISO has requested a number 
of times in the past (unsuccessfully). She said the report never mentions 
""refunds."" The ISO wants to get access to the same data that FERC has or have 
FERC do its assessment in a more public way.

I told her how the press was spinning the story.   ""I was afraid of that,"" 
said she.  I outlined for her how this plays perfectly into Davis' grand 
strategy. I asked why the ISO felt it had to file to get the data, when 
afterall, this was FERC's job and FERC was doing it.  She said, ""Well, the 
Department of Market Analysis has always done this asessment.""  I agreed with 
her.  ""Yes, they have, but now FERC is doimg it, so who pressured you to do 
this.""  ""I can't answer that,"" said she. I suggested they think about the 
spinning factor in the future.

This was posted today in the Idea Vault.  We've bounced it around (Karen, 
Mary, etc.) and we'd like to run it past you.  It would be nice if Enron 
contributed to the solution -- since we've contributed to some of the 
problem!  Mary says perhaps you could bring this up at the next Executive 
Committee meeting.

Thanks.

"
1473,"Please read the proposal below from an excellent ghost writer and 
presentation consultant from the White House Writers Group.  Steve Kean 
suggested looking into this for some fresh ideas to improve our presentations.

We can have a session where we share with them some of our presentations and 
they give us ideas for humor and personalization.  A question is whether this 
would work for internal audiences such as all-employee meetings as well as 
external ones.  Once we understand their methodology and capabilities, we 
might find we can do some of this ourselves, and we would consult with them 
on an as-needed basis for future presentations.

If you are interested in this seminar, let me know if you have a presentation 
that they could review to make suggestions with and pick a possible date for 
a seminar--say Monday December 4th or Tuesday the 5th?  I will forward this 
to the EES and EBS presentation folks, but let me know who else might be 
interested.

1475,"This is an issue we have long struggled with.  We have conducted several 
comprehensive reviews in the past and on an ongoing basis we go through a 
resource allocation process which enables subjective criteria to be

the project is a good idea.  Your sources would be John, Jim Steffes, and

As Mike Day has indicated, we are 99% sure the CPUC will bifurcate the PX

1482,"Attached is the latest draft of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, in both Word 
Perfect and PDF formats.  It still does not cover a number of items several 
of us have discussed, including certain insurance matters.  These items are 
part of an ongoing list of issues.  That list also includes the practical 
applicability of the infamous Section 5.07(b).   

The Disclosure Schedules remain critical.  Please continue to review both the 
parent disclosures and the regional disclosures for gaps, inconsistencies, 
and duplications.  For example, while Corp. Risk Management is scheduling the 
various insurance handled by it, that group is not aware of insurance 
obtained at the local level.  Those policies at the regional level need to be 
listed, as well as checked to confirm that they are not implicated by a 
change of control.  The parent level policies have been reviewed for change 
of control implications.  Also, please confirm that the schedules include all 
claims against the involved entities; for example, there appear to be many 
claims made under the various insurance policies that have not yet become a 
litigation matter.

Timing of the deal could soon become quite ugly.  Thanks for all of the 
help.  Lance.

corporate responsibility representatives from ETS, EBS, EES, and Corporate to 
kick-off the first phase of a Life Cycle Impact Analysis of Enron's products 
and services.  Gavin Dillingham is working with Susan Worthen to determine 
all of Enron's products and services, including volumes. This information 
will be used to prioritize which products and services we examine and the 
scope of their life cycle.
EHS Compliance Manager Modules - Susan Worthen authorized the expenditure for 
an EHS Software consultant to assist in the identification and evaluation of 
EHS software system providers.  Enron's requirements will be identified 
through one-on-one meetings with internal stakeholders.  The value of using a 
third-party to facilitate this process will save significant staff time and 
project delays due to the current workload of the task force.
New Employee Orientation - Kelly Kimberly gave her okay on the graphic for 
the orientation booth.  Mark Wilson (Orientation) will finalize the panel and 
confirm availability so that EHS can man the booth and provide materials for 
new employees.
Corporate Responsibility Video - Mike Terraso and Kelly Kimberly identified 
six key business unit executives to feature in an elevator ""commercial"" 
promoting corporate responsibility vision and values.  Lauren Goldblatt and 
Susan Worthen will meet with Mark Wilson to discuss details.
Annual Report - Hard copies of the annual report are expected by Monday, 
October 2 from the Image Center.  Mike Terraso and Kelly Kimberly will 
distribute to an internal group of business executives and senior management 
with a cover letter.  Other copies will be delivered to Kelly, Mike, Jeff 
Keeler, London PR, and John Hardy for distribution to select groups.
e-Speak - Kelly Kimberly and Mike Terraso were featured on e-Speak to discuss 
Corporate Responsibility.
NARUC Environmental & Energy conference- in response to an invitation from 
NARUC through Sue Landwehr, Mike Terraso made a presentation on future 
natural gas resources and the environmental benefits in electricity 
generation.  He also discussed the energy efficiency , potential  programs 
for  emission credit incentives for energy outsourcing.
Clean Air Award -- Enron was presented an ""Energy Innovation and 
environmental achievement award"" by industry peers at the ""America's Clean 
Air Celebration"" held in Washington, D.C. last week in conjunction with the 
World Fuels Conference.   Event co-chairs included former Senator George 
Mitchell, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and President George Bush 
(who in his remarks recognized Ken Lay's contribution).  Jeff Keeler 
delivered acceptance remarks on behalf of Ken Lay and Enron.
Climate Change -- Mary Schoen spoke at a Pew Center on Climate Change forum 
in New Orleans for state and local officials interested in climate issues, 
outlining Enron's role in providing market solutions to climate change 
problems.   Jeff participated in Business Council for Sustainable Energy 
strategy meetings to discuss a recent proposal forwarded to the UN by the 
United States that may have the effect of disadvantaging early development of 
gas and renewable energy projects.  Jeff will be coordinating with INGAA, 
NGSA and other gas and renewable companies to prepare analysis and response 
to the US delegation to COP6 in the Hague, upcoming in November.
Greenfield Capital Projects:
Venezuelan LNG - Joe Kolb was contacted by James McMillan (development 
engineer) seeking input to assist him as he responds to the Venezuelan 
environmental agency's questions on the EIA.  Their questions focus mainly on 
the nature of the waste that will be generated and how it will be disposed of.

Acquisitions:
Privatenel (Nicaragua) - Don Stevens has been informed that the group is 
reevaluating the numbers provided and a decision on the direction of the 
project is expected next week.
Project ISAGEN (Colombia) - The privatization was initially halted by the 
Colombian judicial system due to a lawsuit filed by the  Medellin local 
utility company (EPM).  As of 9/22/00, the sell off has been reinstated and 
the government will now allow EPM to enter a bid.  The Colombian government 
has qualified EPM, Enron, AEA, and Union Fenosa to bid for the project.  
Sandy Verma has informed me that the project is currently on hold.  The 
instructions are to get the due diligence completed so if it comes alive 
again we have all the work completed.
Project Crane (Quebec, Canada and Port Angeles, Washington) - Don Stevens met 
with Wayne Mays and Robert E. Anderson regarding additional environmental 
questions for AGRA Simons to respond to on the project.
Project INGA (California and Pennsylvania) - RTP Environmental has completed 
their site visits and have supplied preliminary environmental findings.  Don 
Stevens prepared a response for ENA on issues noted by RTP in their 
preliminary environmental findings.  A meeting with Dave DeLaney is scheduled 
for Thursday, September 28, 2000.
Project Dragon (Southeast Asia) - Don Stevens forwarded information as 
requested to Enron's Bangkok office regarding NOx emissions at the Changzhou, 
China facility.  The lender's engineers are currently reviewing the 
environmental due diligence.  Enron is still negotiating with the seller. The 
project may complete around early November.
Military Base Privatization (Texas AFB) - Don Stevens provided environmental 
base line scope of work per Charlie Thompson's request for Dyess AFB, 
Goodfellow AFB, Lackland AFB, Laughlin AFB, Randolph AFB, Sheppard AFB, 
Ellington Field ANGB, Fort Bliss, and NAS JRB Fort Worth.
CWT Thermo-Depolymerization -EES Bruce Stram has requested an environmental 
analysis of the technology. EE&CC  has completed a review of the processes 
involved and is satisfied with the technology.    Don Stevens will set up a 
meeting with  to discuss various environmental issues regarding the project.

Regulatory Technical Analysis

EES Meeting - The Regulatory Technical Analysis Team met with Roger Raney and 
John Nixon of EES to discuss the operations of EES and  the services that the 
RTA team can provide to EES.

ETS Environmental Procedures - Jim Peterson met with Sue Fernandez of ETS to 
discuss changes to the intranet version of the ETS Environmental Procedures.

Houston Non-Attainment Regulation Comments - Marc Phillips compiled and 
submitted Enron's comments to TNRCC regarding the Houston non-attainment 
regulations.

Greenhouse Gas Emission Credits - Marc Phillips is discussing the possible 
use of greenhouse gas emission credits as payment for the methane emission 
survey work Indaco performed at Bushton compressor station. If the deal can 
be completed, it will be presented in a talk by John Shafer at the EPA 
Natural Gas STAR conference in mid-October.

NFPA Proposed Code Revisions - Russell Tucker reviewed 368 currently proposed 
revisions to the NFPA codes and standards to identify those having impact on 
any Enron companies. This review was prompted by feedback from interviews 
conducted with the safety managers of Enron companies in which several 
indicated the NFPA and related building codes were important to their 
operations. Identified for further investigation were proposals on design 
changes for fire control water spray system net flow rates for bay area 
offshore platforms and changes to the Industrial Fire Brigade member 
qualifications to achieve job performance certification.
 Asset Operations

EPA Acid Rain Workshop - Gus Eghneim is attended an EPA workshop for acid 
rain designated representatives.  EPA  discussed the latest developments to 
the acid rain program and other implementation issues.

Stack Testing and CEMS Certification at Wheatland Power - Gus Eghneim 
submitted petitions to EPA to delay any stack testing until summer 2001.  The 
delay would save EES OEC and estimated $400,000 by allowing the plant to 
perform the test during routine operating times and not just for testing. The 
petitions are anticipated to go through the policy review committee by 
October 2, 2000.

State Inspection at New Albany Power - New Albany Power was inspected by the 
State of Mississippi on 9/22/00.  No issues were identified in the 
inspection.  

Safety Video Project Script - Scott Watson devised ""rough draft"" script for 
the New Hire Employee and Contractor Safety Video projects.

Gaza Palestine Power Plant - Scott Watson completed new Hire Safety/Health 
Training Outline as well as shipped training materials to Gaza.  This 
training is to be conducted on October 7th & 8th, 2000 at the Gaza facility.

Legislation

Pipeline Safety -- Legislative situation still remains active, with a strong 
possibility that the House will take up the Senate-passed legislation early 
next week.   In anticipation of resistence from some Democrats who are 
opposing the bill for purely political reasons, we have stepped up lobbying 
efforts with key Democratic constituencies and other interest groups who can 
provide support to the legislation (gas users, governors, steel industry, 
etc.).    Jeff will be speaking on this topic at the ETS management 
conference on Wednesday, October 4.

MTBE -- prospects for legislation this Congress are looking bleak.  The only 
possibility for legislation to move is to attach the Senate Environment 
Committee-passed bill to an appropriations bill, and many key congressional 
leaders are opposed to this strategy because of the controversy surrounding 
the legislation.   We are making sure that key advocates are armed with 
industry transition/conversion funding amendments in case a last-minute 
effort to attach an MTBE ban to some moving legislation is attempted.   

Intelligence/Strategies

Clean Air Act/New Source Review -- the EPA Environmental Appeals Board last 
Friday rejected an appeal by TVA of the EPA's enforcement lawsuits charging 
TVA with multiple NSR violations as a result of plant modifications.   Jeff 
Keeler provided EGM and ENA commercial groups with intelligence as to the 
likely outcomes before and after the ruling, and provided information 
regarding TVA's appeal to a Federal District Court upcoming in November 2000.

Clean Air Act/New Source Review -- Jeff Keeler provided analysis to ENA Gas 
Storage developers working on a project involving Intermountain Power 
Authority in Delta, UT.   ENA is proposing installation of technologies that 
would use gas to increase the utilization of existing 1600 MW coal unit, 
which could raise serious concerns about EPA scrutiny or enforcement of NSR 
regulations.  Jeff also provided ENA commercial and EHS staff with 
intelligence on EPA letters of inquiry (which usually precede NSR enforcement 
actions) sent to Pennsylvania non-utility coal plants, 3 of which ENA is 
considering acquiring.

Clean Air Act/NOx SIP Call -- Mary Schoen was successful in negotiating with 
TVA and Tennesee air regulators, reaching agreement that Enron's sources 
would receive an allocation of 500 tons of NOx per year (the levels that our 
facilities are currently permitted for).    Earlier proposals would have 
limited or completely prevented Enron from receiving NOx allowances.  Mary 
also testified before the Illinois Pollution Control Board on their SIP 
development, advocating fair allocation of allowances to new sources and 
market-based trading systems.    

Clean Air Act/California Air Pollution Offsets -- Mary Schoen held meetings 
with ENA West developers regarding the shortage of air pollution offsets 
(required by local air quality districts) needed to develop power projects.   
Jeff and Mary will be developing strategies for creating or obtaining offsets 
and working with California developers in the near future.

Environmental Product Strategy meeting -- Stacey Bolton continues to receive 
positive feedback from last week's meeting with commercial groups on 
opportunities related to green power/renewables.   Stacey is working on 
developing a comprehensive analysis of markets for renewable energy, 
incentive monies, and supply/demand issues so that we can identify potential

	CAN NEW YORK AVOID CALIFORNIA'S BLACKOUTS? 
Monday,April 2,2001 
	
	By WILLIAM TUCKER 
	
	
WILL New York be able to avoid a California-type power shortage this summer? 
Right now, the odds look pretty good. A lot depends right now on whether 
Mayor Giuliani can keep his mouth shut. 
	Last week, the mayor departed from his Republican principles for a moment to 
advocate ""temporary"" price controls on wholesale electricity in the 
Northeast. 
	""The double-digit price increases that New Yorkers had to pay last summer are 
just unacceptable,"" said Giuliani at a press conference. ""Deregulation should 
not be abandoned, it should be completed. The problem is when we deregulated 
we didn't think it would affect us so quickly. We need a little adjustment 
right now."" 
	Ah yes, just a teeny-weenie little adjustment just to get us through the next 
few months, right? Just like rent control - a ""temporary wartime measure"" 
imposed in 1943. 
	Price controls are never temporary. They just make things worse by producing 
shortages. And the more shortages they produce, the more people agitate for 
more regulations. It's a vicious cycle that eventually becomes almost 
impossible to escape. 
	California is having blackouts right now because, until this week at least, 
the public and political officials were unwilling to accept a rate increase. 
(Before last week, Gov. Gray Davis' major power-conservation achievement was 
having ""energy savings tips"" printed on McDonald's placemats.) 
	Rate hikes do two essential things: 1) encourage people to conserve and 2) 
bring in more supply. That's exactly what's needed. Mayor Giuliani's price 
controls would only anaesthetize the public to the need for conservation and 
discourage supply - a perfect prescription for California-type blackouts. 
	What's even more important than avoiding rotating blackouts, however, is 
convincing people that environmental amenities don't come free. If everybody 
is going to oppose power plants in their neighborhood, then nobody is going 
to have enough electricity. 
	California got itself into its mess by refusing to build power plants over 
the last 20 years. The state didn't want nuclear (too dangerous), it didn't 
want coal (too dirty), so it formulated a make-believe strategy of 
""conservation and renewables."" In fact, the Golden State has done a heroic 
job in both. California ranks dead last among the 50 states in per-capita 
electricity consumption. It also gets 12 percent of its energy from 
renewables (geothermal, windmills, biomass, solar electric) - as opposed to 1 
percent for the rest of the country. 
	Yet the state still finds itself woefully short of power. There isn't any 
substitute for large generating stations. Contrary to public opinion, 
electricity is not produced by sticking the plug in the wall. 
	New York faces the same long-range problems. The city has not built a new 
power plant since 1959. Nobody upstate wants power plants either. (They argue 
it would ""reindustrialize the Hudson."") Right now, residents of Rockland 
County are furiously resisting a clean, new 600-mega- watt power station in 
an already industrialized area. Yet even building in Rockland won't help New 
York City, because nobody wants the transmission lines either. 
	The final verdict from the laws of supply-and-demand is simple. If demand 
goes up and supply doesn't respond, then prices will go up as well. 
	Even mainstream environmental groups now acknowledge this. ""We're all in 
favor of building new gas generators,"" says Ashok Gupta, senior economist at 
the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is not opposing the 10 peaking 
generators proposed for the city. ""The new plants are twice as efficient and 
much cleaner. Every time we build a clean, new gas plant, we back out two 
dirty older ones."" The Sierra Club is also backing new natural-gas power 
plants in California. 
	What's needed is a system for compensating people who live in the immediate 
vicinity. There are dozens of possibilities. Property taxes could be lowered, 
people could be paid cash rewards or given free electricity. Many an upstate 
town and village lives comfortably with prisons or power plants because they 
lower property taxes and provide jobs for the community. 
	""We can have both adequate power and a clean environment,"" says Gupta, who 
lives and works in Manhattan. ""The technology for improvements, both on 
supply and demand. The only thing lacking is consensus and leadership."" It's 
a small price to pay for avoiding a California debacle. 
	
	
	
	
	

	
	

	
	RUDY'S ELECTRIC ERROR 
Monday,April 2,2001 
	
	
	
The energy crisis now building nationally is serious, but it's no cause for 
panic. Mayor Giuiliani, for one, needs to rethink a key element in his own 
approach to New York's incipient energy woes. 
	For sure, Hizzoner last week included some common-sense pronouncements in his 
prescription - such as forcefully telling the environmentalists and ""not in 
my backyard"" crowds that more energy-producing plants are essential if New 
York is to avoid a California-style crisis. 
	However, in one area, Mayor Giuliani is wrong: He wants energy price 
controls. 
	Yes, energy prices are going to spike in the near term. And it will be 
tempting to define the results as an ""emergency"" warranting government 
intervention. 
	But today's emergency becomes tomorrow's entitlement. 
	""Temporary"" actions acquire constituencies that fight tooth and nail to keep 
them permanently in place. 
	For example, take rent control - please. 
	It was a wartime - World War II - provision instituted in 1943. 
	Two years later, the war ended. Fifty-eight years later, the ""emergency"" 
controls remain. 
	And affordable New York City apartments are nearly nonexistent. 
	The rent controls give landlords little incentive to maintain existing 
buildings. New construction goes only to pricey luxury apartments. Thus it 
has become nearly impossible for the middle-class to live in Manhattan. 
	If you like what rent control has wrought in the Big Apple's housing market, 
you'll love what price controls will do for the energy market. 
	Rudolph Giuliani's legacy is assured. It is undeniably a positive one - 
having, among other things, made the city safe and livable once again. 
	What a pity to tar that by being the mayor who saddled succeeding city 
leaders with price controls that would cause energy shortages far into the 
future.

1502,"Executive Summary
? FERC Considers Price Caps in the West
? Davis/SoCal Ed MOU subject to legislative revisions (we still stand by our 
early reports that the SoCal/Davis transmission deal will most likely fail 
and that SoCal will follow PG&E into bankruptcy court)

FERC mitigates price spikes in the West
FERC Chairman Hebert has placed a RTO West proposal onto the agenda for this 
week's meeting. The proposal would ""mitigate"" price surges by requiring 
generating companies to sell power into California and other western states 
during Stage 3 emergencies (when there is less than 1% surplus electricity in 
the grid) and cap the price generators could charge during these highest 
states of emergency. 
1)  The FERC proposal would not set price caps for any other time than Stage 
3 emergencies
2)  It would expire after a year
3)  It would set the top reference rate at ""cost plus"" based on the cost to 
produce electricity by the most inefficient producer 
FERC is also looking at initiatives that would encourage the agriculture 
industry to possibly sell their power and natural gas contracts instead of 
using them to produce their products. Although this proposal has not been 
formally approved or voted on at this time, the Chairman's control over 
FERC's agenda is absolute and nothing gets on the agenda he does not want to 
consider. Thus, if it stays on the agenda through meeting time, the odds of 
it passing are quite high if the meeting avoids total breakdown into 
hard-headed chaos. The key has been Commissioner Breathitt.  The two recently 
nominated Commissioners have not yet been approved by the Senate and so 
cannot vote this week. Thus any change in Breathitt's position definitively 
tips the balance of power in FERC.
Davis & SoCal. MOU not a Done Deal 
According to sources, the first legislative alteration to the Davis/SoCal MOU 
will involve removing the dedicated rate component necessary to repay SoCal's 
creditors.  This point only highlights the Senates' indecision on how to deal 
with paying off generators.  Solutions currently range from seizing assets to 
seeking legal relief for corporate price gouging and sources indicate that 
the QFs are still likely to file involuntary bankruptcy against SoCal upon 
the Senate's first official sign of unwillingness to work with creditors.   

"
1503,"I agree with Peace that it is wrong for the ""discredited"" ISO and PX boards 
to select their replacements.  But little else.

1505,"In light of the Commerce Committee Hearing and the FERC Hearing on the 11th 
and 12th, wanted to provide a quick synopsis of the CPUC Hearing in SD.

It was the same quasi-legislative format as the previous hearing.  Speakers 
were invited by the Commission and only the ALJ and the Commissioners could 
cross-examine the witnesses.  Commissioners Lynch and Wood presided.  Michael 
Kahn, chairman of the Electricity Oversight Board was there and participated 
in some cross-examination as well.

Speakers were:

ISO:  
Kellan Fluckiger, COO
Anjali Sheffrin, Director of Market Analysis
Frank Wolak, Chairman of Market Surveillance Committee

Cal PX:
David Jermain, former VP, Compliance, Audits & Reg. Affairs
Seth Wilson, 

South Coast Air Quality Management District:
Carol Coy, Deputy Executive Director

CPUC:
Harvey Morris, Principal Attorney

SDG&E:
Donald Garber

ISO's main message was that many factors contribute to the high prices in the 
wholesale market:

 1.  Demand growth over past two years at or around 5% (98-99, 99-00)
 2.  Lack of generation additions in entire west
 3.  Reduced imports of electricity from NW, due to low hydro and policy to 
retain water in spring.
 4.  Natural Gas price increases over 1999, at almost 2x's 1999 levels in 
August
 5.  Nox emissions trading at or around $40/pound
 6.  Increased underscheduling from June-August

ISO has concluded that the reduction in the price caps (from $500 to $250) 
have increased the overall cost of electricity, with the highest total 
cost/MWh ($180) experienced in August, relative to $167/MWh in June and $118 
in July.  Reason given is that the caps have reduced markup (could be 
interpreted as generator profit) in peak hours, but supply costs have been 
driven up in lower load hours.  

While ISO staff said they will seek an extension of its authority from FERC 
to be set price caps, also raised concerns about the affect any further 
reductions would have on the market.  They conclude that such a reduction 
would deter new investment,  preclude generators from recovering fixed costs 
of production, and increase dependence on OOM purchases (as a result of lower 
imports).

ISO staff will make a proposal to the ISO Board, October 6, to do the 
following:

1.  File for extension of price cap authority to FERC.
2.  Request FERC to institute mandatory forward contract requirement on 
generators for a significant portion of their capacity.
3.  CPUC should allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and 
hedged by UDCs
4.  CPUC and state should promote price responsive demand programs
5.  Maintain sufficient planning reserves.

ISO Staff also stated that:

1.  Need to create disincentive for underscheduling for load and generation
 a.  Charge OOM cost to underscheduled load
 b.  Charge replacement reserve cost to underscheduled generation
 c.  Additional charge for real-time market transactions

2.  Attract and expedite new resources

MARKET POWER:

While the Commissioners spent the majority of the day picking apart the 
underlying reasons for the rise in prices, the conclusion of the hearing was 
President Lynch asking the ISO and PX to name names on who has been exerting 
market power.  Both the PX and the ISO said that it would be impossible to 
determine from the information they have.  Secondly, the analysis they have 
done show that no single market participant is consistently exhibiting the 
ability (opportunity) to exercise market power.  Therefore, at one point or 
another, nearly every market participant has market power.

Wolak suggested that in order to reduce the amount of market power in peak 
periods, require forward contracting OR increase profit incentives in 
off-peak period, where generators many times sell below short-run marginal 
costs.

No further quasi-legislative hearings are planned."

government would be the guarantor of the sales under the DOE order.  I have

household electricity bills had been cut by 750 million pounds (if you are a 
Yank, multiply by 1.5 for dollars saved), since the industry was opened to 
competition two years ago.  Of course, much of this may be attributable to 
the divestment of assets in the oligopolistic generation sector, now

should be cited as a counterweight to those arguing that competition is a 
""failed experiment"".  Paul Dawson, head of our UK regulatory team, can

1509,"The Hearings
The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like 
environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility 
witnesses.
The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship.
The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E 
witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices 
since restructuring started in 1998.
Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for 
investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g., 
dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and 
parent's use of that cash for investment activities).  
Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the 
utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from 
parent, bankruptcy).
The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward 
PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings 
progress.
Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by 
Edison witness.
Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to 
issue its decision on Thursday.
At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed 
the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general 
ratemaking authority.

Outside the Hearing
Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management 
continue.
Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities 
inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain 
some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room.
Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with 
utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any 
rate increases.
Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission 
absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor 
follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of 
the state speech on the 8th."

SEC. 2813. CONVEYANCE AUTHORITY REGARDING UTILITY SYSTEMS OF
          MILITARY DEPARTMENTS.

     (a) Selection of Conveyee.--Subsection (b) of section 2688 of title
  10, United States Code, is amended--
     (1) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``If more than one''; and

     (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:

     ``(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned may use
  procedures other than competitive procedures, but only in accordance
  with subsections (c) through (f) of section 2304 of this title, to
  select the conveyee of a utility system (or part of a utility system)
  under subsection (a).
     ``(3) With respect to the solicitation process used in connection
  with the conveyance of a utility system (or part of a utility system)
  under subsection (a), the Secretary concerned shall ensure that the
  process is conducted in a manner consistent with the laws and
  regulations of the State in which the utility system is located to the
  extent necessary to ensure that all interested regulated and unregulated
  utility companies and other interested entities receive an opportunity
  to acquire and operate the utility system to be conveyed.''.
     (b) Applicability of Regulatory Requirements.--Subsection (f) of such
  section is amended--
     (1) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``The Secretary''; and

     (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:

     ``(2) The Secretary concerned shall require in any contract for the
  conveyance of a utility system (or part of a utility system) under
  subsection (a) that the conveyee manage and operate the utility system
  in a manner consistent with applicable Federal and State regulations
  pertaining to health, safety, fire, and environmental requirements.''.



                      Conveyance authority regarding utility systems of 
military

           departments (sec. 2813)

       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 2813) that would amend
   section 2688 of title 10, United States Code, to require the secretary
   concerned to comply with the competition requirements of section 2304 of
   title 10, United States Code, in the conveyance of utility system
   infrastructure. The provision would also require that the secretary
   concerned carry out a conveyance or award only if he determines that the
   conveyance or award complies with State laws, regulations, rulings, and
   policies governing the provision of utility systems.
       The Senate amendment contained a provision (sec. 2813) that would
   amend section 2688 of title 10, United States Code, to clarify that the
   secretary concerned may use procedures other than competitive procedures
   only under the circumstances specified in section 2304 (c) through (f)
   of title 10, United States Code.
       The House recedes with an amendment that would require the secretary
   concerned to structure the solicitation process for the privatization of
   utility systems on military installations in such a manner that would
   allow, to the maximum extent possible, all interested regulated and
   unregulated entities the opportunity to acquire and operate utility
   systems on military installations regardless of franchise rights in the
   area of the installation concerned. The amendment would also direct the
   secretary concerned to require the conveyee or awardee of the utility
   system to manage and operate the utility system consistent with federal
   and state regulations pertaining to health safety, fire, and
   environmental requirements.                                             "

help to make sure I have ""Gore-like"" command of the details.  Please help 
with the following information:
Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any 
presentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we 
have under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are 
comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever 
information you have.
Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information 
was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking 
facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.
Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from 
the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would 
be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already 
approved.
Cancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel 
comfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of 
how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.
ISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is 
there another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of 
the PX report too.
CEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: 
proposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to 
expedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less 
than 10%)?
Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the ""soft"" nature of 
the cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it 
to say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting 
requirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than 
applying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears 
the market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?
Offers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus 
any others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market 
will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility 
(and the regulators) out of the merchant function.
Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be 
courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway 
credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else ""squishing"" on the 
price cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need 
these guys on board.
Thanks."

1527,"Not a bad wire story - relevant for our conference call later today. Reuters 
in London called me at breakfast yesterday, then Mark gave them some on the 
record comments later. See quote. I had pointed them at lessons to be learnt 
in relation to Spain and Netherlands, and you will see there are a couple of 
mentions of those countries (though only in context of interconnection 
capacity) towards the end of the piece. I think other relevant lessons would 
be related to perils of allowing retail and wholesale (esp. pools for 
residual capacity) markets to be divorced in regulatory terms one from the 
other. Difference from California, however, is that the divorce in Spain and 
Netherlands works currently to detriment of new entrants and to the benefit 
of vertically integrated incumbents.

Future Looks Dark for New York Market;=20
NYSEG Outlines Energy Policy

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News item from Reuters] New York State Electric & Gas Corp. (NYSEG), one o=
f=20
New York's seven utilities, said the state will not have enough megawatts t=
o=20
support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until 2008. NYSEG, in=
 a=20
report issued late Wednesday, warned there are ""serious problems with (New=
=20
York's) generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline=20
infrastructure."" The report challenges a market appraisal by the New York=
=20
Independent System Operator (NYISO), which has run the state's wholesale=20
power market since 1999. The NYSEG report, titled ``New York State's Electr=
ic=20
Energy Crisis and NYSEG's Comprehensive Solution,'' criticizes the NYISO fo=
r=20
not giving power consumers ""price certainty"" in the transition from local=
=20
monopolies to an open, competitive market.=20

Analysis: New York can now officially be added to the list of troubled ener=
gy=20
markets, as market projections and fundamental structural problems spell ou=
t=20
an alarming prognosis for the state as it heads into the summer season.=20
However, unlike California, which basically faces a power supply problem th=
at=20
can be improved over time, New York arguably suffers from a more severe and=
=20
permanent set of conditions that cannot be easily resolved. Like its West=
=20
Coast counterpart, New York also suffers from a supply / demand imbalance a=
nd=20
local resistance that thwarts new generation development. However, even if =
or=20
when power supply can be increased in New York, the core load center of New=
=20
York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that contin=
ue=20
to take their own toll on the stability of the market.=20

Various stakeholders in the New York market have now begun to place blame o=
n=20
each other in advance of what could shape up to be a very problematic summe=
r.=20
As noted, in its new report, NYSEG, a subsidiary of Energy East (NYSE: EAS)=
,=20
is especially critical of NYISO, which it says has contributed to soaring=
=20
wholesale prices in New York. NYSEG also blames NYISO for outlining=20
unrealistic goals for new power supply, not providing accurate price signal=
s=20
to energy customers, and for not doing enough to solve immediate problems. =
=20

Yet, beyond the finger pointing, some essential facts can be established, o=
n=20
which both NYSEG and the NYISO apparently agree. According to data included=
=20
in the NYISO report, between 1995 and 2000, while statewide demand in New=
=20
York rose by 2,700 MW, generating capacity under contract in the state=20
increased only by 1,060 MW. New York has not brought a new plant online sin=
ce=20
1996, when a 200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost seven year=
s=20
since a 1,000 MW unit in Oswego, N.Y. marked the last plant to open upstate=
. =20

In addition, New York suffers from severe transmission bottlenecks. Deficie=
nt=20
transmission systems in central New York, around New York City and at the=
=20
outlining borders to other states and Canada limit the amount of power than=
=20
can be imported into the state. New York City is relatively isolated from t=
he=20
transmission grids that serve the rest of the state and must rely heavily o=
n=20
city-based power supply. New York City's load should reach 10,535 MW this=
=20
summer alone, requiring 8,428 MW of in-city capacity, along with imports, t=
o=20
meet demand and provide a reserve margin. With a current capacity of 8,132=
=20
MW, there is a potential 296 MW shortfall. These projections presume normal=
=20
weather conditions. If New York experiences a warmer-than-normal summer, th=
e=20
outlook gets even worse. =20

Further, according to a report from New York's State Attorney General,=20
between 1988 and 1998 capital improvements to New York's transmission syste=
m=20
dropped from $307.7 million per year to $90 million per year. At the presen=
t=20
time, only one major addition to the transmission system in the state is=20
scheduled. A proposed underwater line linking Long Island to Connecticut=20
would provide Long Island with about 300 MW of additional power and increas=
e=20
its import capacity by about 4 percent. Unless this transmission expansion =
is=20
expedited, it is not scheduled for operation until 2002. =20

Consequently, given all of these factors, power supplies in New York most=
=20
certainly will be strained this summer when warmer temperatures drive up th=
e=20
use of air conditioners, pushing demand to annual highs. While NYSEG and th=
e=20
NYISO may agree on the nature of New York's problems, a contentious debate=
=20
has emerged with regard to finding a solution. In its own proposal, release=
d=20
in early March, the NYISO focused on building new generation, expediting=20
siting processes, improving transmission lines, and conservation efforts. I=
n=20
one of its key proposals, the NYISO urged the creation of 8,600 MW of new=
=20
electricity (roughly 30 percent of New York's peak demand) by 2005, with up=
=20
to 5,000 MW of that generation being made available by the end of 2001. =20

NYSEG immediately denounced the plan for ""falling short in its assessment o=
f=20
the magnitude of the crisis"" and issued its own proposals in its recent=20
report. For instance, NYSEG officials said that NYISO had ""grossly=20
oversimplified the situation"" and that, considering the tenuous state of=20
power construction in New York, the objective of establishing 8,600 MW by=
=20
2005 was ""extremely unrealistic."" In turn, NYSEG says that a robust wholesa=
le=20
electric market will not materialize in New York until 2008, assuming that=
=20
measures to repair the problems in the state are taken immediately. In earl=
y=20
March, NYSEG released the ""NYSEGPlan,"" outlining six steps which it believe=
s=20
""contain the real solutions to ensure a successful transition"" to a=20
competitive market in New York. In summary, the NYSEGPlan includes:=20

Streamlining the siting and approval process to build new generating plants=
.=20
Adding to the state's transmission capacity. =20
Adding to the state's natural-gas supply infrastructure.  =20
Creating a regional transmission organization to increase supply liquidity.=
=20
Reinforcing the need for wise energy use by all consumers, by encouraging=
=20
interruptible load where feasible, and building the technological=20
infrastructure necessary for real-time pricing.=20
Approving the NYSEG Price Protection Plan, in which electric rates would be=
=20
frozen for seven years, by July 1, 2001.=20

However, while NYSEG criticized NYISO for espousing unrealistic goals, the=
=20
same obstacles inherent in New York's market might also thwart its own ener=
gy=20
plan. For instance, topping the list of NYSEG's six steps is an emphasis on=
=20
establishing new generation in New York through a streamlined siting and=20
approval process. This may be easier said than done. As I mentioned in my=
=20
3/22/01IssueAlert, the opposition to new power plants in New York equals th=
e=20
lobbying force that community groups in California wield. In that column, I=
=20
discussed the fact that Sithe Energies has downscaled a proposed plant in=
=20
Ramapo, N.Y. (from an 827-MW combined-cycle facility to a 510-MW peaking=20
unit) due to opposition raised by local residents. =20

In addition, just yesterday, a New York Supreme Court judged blocked effort=
s=20
by the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to build two 44-MW gas-fired=20
generators in the borough of Queens. The Supreme Court judge order NYPA to=
=20
""cease all construction on the units"" and ruled that the power authority=20
violated state environmental-review laws to its efforts to rush the plant=
=20
into service by June. In response, NYPA has said that the plants=01*along w=
ith=20
nine others that it is hoping to build throughout New York City=01*are need=
ed to=20
prevent power outages this summer. NYPA continues to face fierce opposition=
=20
from community groups (many of them launching lawsuits) who do not want the=
=20
generation units in their neighborhoods. =20

Consequently, the supply / demand imbalance in New York is a very serious=
=20
matter, and one that residents in the state may not fully appreciate unless=
=20
blackouts occur. Until the core problem of insufficient transmission lines=
=20
surrounding New York State and New York City are solved, adding new power=
=20
supply (assuming that generation development can move past community=20
opposition) would not be enough to bring more balance to the market. In the=
=20
interim, conservation efforts may truly be the only tool that New Yorkers c=
an=20
user to abate power outages this summer, but again the general public may n=
ot=20
fully understand the need to reduce their power usage. =20

New York basically has three options at this point to prepare for near-term=
=20
problems. First, expedite the building of new generation sources (including=
=20
distribution generation alternatives). This assumes that gas lines will be=
=20
sufficient to import necessary fuel. Second, allow the economy of New York=
=20
City to stagnate as a result of the supply / demand imbalance, which will=
=20
drive residents out of the city and in turn reduce demand. And, third, focu=
s=20
on conservation efforts, which again may not work until residents are=20
directly impacted by outages. The city may choose a combination of all thre=
e=20
approaches or decide to focus on just one. However, to address the immediat=
e=20
concerns, it does not appear that New York has any options besides this=20
three-tier approach.=20

One point that bears mentioning is the similarity between California and Ne=
w=20
York regarding the position that both states took on divestiture. Although =
it=20
is not completely accurate to say that either state officially mandated=20
divestiture, utilities in both California and New York felt intense pressur=
e=20
to divest and submitted restructuring plans that included the sale of most =
of=20
their power plants. NYSEG, the author of the new report on New York's power=
=20
problems, is one utility that sold all of its generation assets and will=20
remain only in the transmission business. This most likely creates a=20
heightened sensitivity on NYSEG's part with regard to the power supply=20
shortages presently facing New York. Again, we now have two states that=20
represent the array of problems that can result when the vertical utility=
=20
model becomes dismantled. Of course, it is not fair to say that divestiture=
=20
is the sole source of the current problems in California and New York, but=
=20
taking away a utility's ability to effectively control is own power supply=
=20
costs certainly contributed to the vulnerability in both states. =20

"
1544,"Tom and Cynthia--The SE reports includes some dings against TVA.


On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit."")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively"" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

FERC Approves NEPOOL's Three-Part Bids

On April 25, FERC approved NEPOOL=01,s proposal to implement a system where=
=20
generators can submit three-part supply offers consisting of a start-up=20
price, an hourly no-load price, and an incremental energy price.  NEPOOL al=

In approving NEPOOL=01,s three-part bid system, FERC finds that the system =

FERC Rejects Proposal to Disclose Bidding Information

In an April 13 FERC order of no overall interest to us, FERC includes a=20
discussion about the rules for disclosure of bidding and other data gathere=
d=20
by the ISO.  Braintree had argued that FERC should require public disclosur=

of bidding and other data in order to allow NEPOOL participants to monitor=

FERC=01,s rules strike an appropriate balance between the need to disclose =

Information Policy

NEPOOL submitted a March 5, 2001 request for revisions to NEPOOL=01,s=20

NEPOOL Participant confidential information directly from ISO-NE.  On April=

information.  However, the Commission notes that the information given to=

Market Monitor Information Collection

ISO filed revised procedures intended to give ISO the authority to monitor=

=20
Under the revised procedures, a reference price is calculated for each 10MW=

deviate significantly from the reference price. =20

Under the ISO's proposed procedures, prospective mitigation will occur if I=

determines that the bid will have a significant effect on the relevant mark=

why its bid is not anti-competitive.  If a bid is mitigated, ISO will=20

implement these new mitigation measures on July 1.  ISO also proposed to=20
release bid data after a 3 months delay (FERC previously ordered ISO to=20
release bid data after a 6 month delay).

Many generators opposed the procedures; Braintree argued they do not go far=

The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

As promised, here are two deals you can gobble up for savings--$328
roundtrip to your choice of 15 Caribbean cities for travel through June 15
AND coast-to-coast U.S. travel for $198 roundtrip, or less.

Most of us are busy preparing for the Thanksgiving holiday and clearing
the decks for a  four-day weekend. Bestfares.com will be posting new deals
throughout the holiday, but we=01,ll make this newsletter short and sweet,
whet your appetite with the best of our specials and leave you with room
for delicious desserts of deals. Our hot, new Caribbean sale can save you
up to 60 percent in the most popular travel season, and you still have
time for last-minute savings on Turkey fares. Without further ado, we=01,ll
serve up our buffet of bargains.

50 U.S. CITIES TO 15 CARIBBEAN CITIES FROM $328 RT
Bestfares.com offers members a chance to perk up in a Caribbean paradise
with peak season fares beginning at only $328 roundtrip for travel through
June 15, 2001. We are having one knockout of a sale to 15 Caribbean cities
with airfares discounted by up to $500 for the high winter season, when
many travelers want to warm themselves under the tropical sun. We=01,ll war=
m

Southeastern cities, roundtrips are only $328; from the Midwest, $428; and
from the West Coast, just $458. These specials are valid to Caribbean

SUPER $198 RT SALE COAST-TO-COAST BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES
This past week, we watched business travelers get hit with their sixth
fare hike of the year. Some routes of over 1,500 miles have increased by
as much as $370 roundtrip since January 1, 2000. Fight back with our
leisure fares from select U.S. cities that let you fly coast to coast for
as little as $198 roundtrip through March 30, 2001 (travel to Florida
markets is valid through March 14). For example, fly from Seattle to
Orlando or San Diego to Baltimore. You have many options for travel
throughout the nation. Tickets must be purchased by December 1, 2000. Get
back some of the money the airlines have gotten for your business trips by
using our coast-to-coast $198 Super Sale fares. Access more information at
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898

THERE=01,S STILL TIME TO FLY ON TURKEY DAY FROM $59 RT
The trick to getting a great fare for those last minute home for the
holiday flights is to travel on Thursday and return on Friday. These
specials are valid for travel throughout both days, but availability is
best for travel later in the day on Thanksgiving, and return travel early
in the day on Friday. You can enjoy a late meal with your family, pack up
some leftovers and be home in time to rest up over the weekend. These
deals start at $59 (New York City to Boston, for example). You can travel
coast to coast from $151. Fares are based on one-way mileage: 250 miles
for $64 to $79 roundtrip; 251-500 miles for $79 to $99 roundtrip; 501-750
miles for $103 to $129 roundtrip; 751-1,000 miles for $119 to $149
roundtrip; 1,001-1,250 miles for $139 to $169 roundtrip; and over 1,250
miles for $151 to $189 roundtrip. Get the big end of the holiday dinner

I put some question marks next to Brad, John, Pete and Sandra's products.  You have them down as managing some physical products.  Will they be managing those physical books?

 "
1588,"I started looking at the prompt month positions yesterday and noticed that many of the deals moved to the bankruptcy book have not been deleted in sitara.  I don't think that most people checked the bottom of the sitara deal to see that the volumes were zero for future months.  I started comparing the Bankruptcy index book to a prompt month calc. and fixed as much as I could for the East and West, I just started on Central but we should check this all again on Monday.  Because of this, we have not reported any prompt month physical value.  The rates group hasn't been around to get the demand charges either.  We should have everything clean to report it on Monday.

Going forward I guess we need to show people how to check it correctly.

See you on Monday.

changing the names of their gas books as well.  The names of the new gas 
books and traders are as follows:

If you need to know their power desk to map their ID to their gas books, 
those desks are as follows:

We have about 10 people who had they stayed at Enron estate for another 30 - 60 days would have vested in the Enron pension plan (cash-balance plan). We have tried to find some way to make something work here, but as it stands it looks like the are going to have to transfer on 8th of Feb and forfeit whatever was in this plan (roughly 5% of base salary per year and it is a 5 year service vesting arrangement).

USA: WRAPUP 1-Credit quality in broad decline as defaults soar.

By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Corporate credit quality will likely grow much=
 worse before it gets better, and about $100 billion of corporate debt will=
 likely go into default this year as the United States heads into recession=
, according to reports issued on Monday by two top credit rating agencies.=
=20
Moody's Investors Service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 1=
22 U.S. companies with $543 billion of debt in the third quarter, dwarfing =
the 22 companies with $66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade. Rev=
iews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit.=20
""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third q=
uarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next =
year,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist.=20
Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's said more than 200 companies will default on a=
bout $100 billion of debt this year, compared with 117 defaulting on a reco=
rd $42.3 billion in 2000.=20
It said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated ""BB-plus"" or lower by=
 S&P and ""Ba1"" or lower by Moody's because of their credit risks - will rea=
ch 9.4 percent by year end. Moody's forecasts a 10 percent rate.=20
""The U.S. economy is clearly in a recession,"" said S&P Chief Economist Davi=
d Wyss in a statement. ""Although Standard & Poor's expects it to be relativ=
ely mild and end in early 2002, the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is=
 high.""=20
Both agencies said the Sept. 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a thr=
ee-year slump in corporate credit quality. Moody's blamed 38 reviews for do=
wngrade in September alone on the attacks.=20
COSTS RISE, PROTECTION WEAKENS=20
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons.=20
These include the weakening economy, the inability of many marginal compani=
es to raise cash at tolerable interest rates, share buybacks, debt-financed=
 merger activity, and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlin=
es, insurance and travel.=20
""Many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dr=
y up and be pushed over the brink,"" said David Keisman, managing director a=
t S&P Risk Solutions.=20
Even well-known companies are suffering rating declines.=20
On Monday alone, for example, S&P downgraded McDonald Corp. after the world=
's largest fast-food chain said it will buy back up to $5 billion of stock,=
 at a time S&P said the company's ""growth prospects for the future are less=
 optimistic.""=20
Meanwhile, Moody's downgraded Enron Corp., and warned it may downgrade it a=
gain. The energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confid=
ence, reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two =
weeks, as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business.=20
Puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year, in part beca=
use interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets =
more conservatively.=20
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing=
 costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost busine=
ss revenues,"" he said.=20
Still, through Friday, Moody's has said in the fourth quarter it may downgr=
ade 47 companies, and upgrade just four.

USA: U.S. firms say deals with Enron at normal levels.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Major U.S. wholesale natural gas and electricit=
y traders said on Monday their deals with troubled Enron Corp. are still ru=
nning at normal levels.=20
But some are keeping a wary eye on the company's finances and credit status=
 after a downgrade by one of the major rating agencies.
""We certainly are very well aware of what our exposure is to them and watch=
ing that on a daily basis,"" Chief Executive Marce Fuller of Atlanta energy =
marketer Mirant Corp. told Reuters.=20
""At this point, I would categorize it as pretty much as business as usual w=
ith Enron, but we'll have to keep a close eye on it as we move forward,"" sa=
id Fuller.=20
Officials at companies such as Houston natural gas firm El Paso Corp. and C=
olumbus, Ohio, utility holding company American Electric Power Co. Inc. exp=
ressed similar sentiments, saying nothing had changed in their dealings wit=
h the Houston-based energy company, at least for the time being.=20
""We continue to trade with them,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Pierce of Charl=
otte-based utility Duke Energy Corp.. ""They've always been meticulous in th=
eir credit management and we continue to see that with them,"" she added.=20
Enron's shares fell to yet another new low on Monday as the company said it=
 was lobbying banks for a new credit line and rating agency Moody's Investo=
r Service downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt to two notches abo=
ve junk-bond status.=20
Since Oct. 12 Enron's stock has fallen some 60 percent after the company re=
ported its first quarterly loss in over four years, wrote down shareholders=
' equity by $1.2 billion dollars and failed to quell investors' jitters abo=
ut a series of complex off-balance-sheet financial deals.=20
CONFIDENCE CRUMBLES=20
Analysts say that if confidence in Enron continued to crumble, it could res=
trict the company's access to credit and thus create problems for its core =
energy trading operations.=20
European energy industry sources told Reuters earlier on Monday that there =
was already evidence of European companies shying away from trading with En=
ron because of credit worries.=20
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron in Europe=
 as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit =
arrangements, the sources said.=20
""They are talking with us about bank letters of credit,"" said the head of r=
isk management at one U.K. utility that halted its trade with Enron last we=
ek. ""The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very res=
trictive basis.""=20
Traders in the U.S. wholesale energy markets said on Monday that they were =
continuing to deal with Enron and still regard the company as a reliable tr=
ading partner.=20
""I don't have any problems dealing with Enron, especially since I'm doing d=
ay-ahead trades. But I have heard the rumors of people not wanting to deal =
with them,"" one natural gas trader in the U.S. Southeast told Reuters.=20
A trader who specializes in longer-term deals in the forwards market for el=
ectricity said publicity about Enron's woes had not yet led to any loss of =
market liquidity.=20
""Obviously there's a concern, but the financial situation is not a factor n=
ow,"" the trader said.=20
Despite the public words of reassurance that many of them have been speakin=
g, Enron's major competitors and trading partners continue to monitor the s=
ituation closely.=20
""Any time a counterparty starts looking like their credit rating is deterio=
rating, then that would certainly be a signal to us to become more worried,=
"" said Mirant's Fuller.

Enron Bonds Stabilize But Market Players Are Concerned
By Michael C. Barr
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Uncertainty about Enron Corp. (ENE) continues to dog=
 investors concerned about the future of the Houston-based energy services =
company.=20
""It's such a fluid situation that the market would like to see a clarificat=
ion of the company's circumstances,"" said Eric Bergson, portfolio manager, =
Northern Trust Global Investments, Chicago. Until this occurs, the outlook =
for the company's bonds is choppy, he added.
Enron drew down about $3 billion in credit lines last week to increase cash=
 reserves and calm jittery markets, buying back its outstanding commercial =
paper. And, it's currently negotiating with its bank group for an additiona=
l $1 billion to $2 billion in new credit, according to a report in Monday's=
 Wall Street Journal.=20
Enron's troubles began earlier this month with the announcement of a $618 m=
illion third-quarter loss and the disclosure of a $1.2 billion erosion of i=
nvestor equity related to transactions conducted with its former chief fina=
ncial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
""The company did not learn from the mistakes of others by not being ahead o=
f the game on disclosure,"" said Mitch Stapley, portfolio manager and chief =
fixed income officer, Fifth Third Investment Advisors, Grand Rapids, Mich. =
It becomes harder to regain investors' trust, he said.=20
Moody's Investors Service lowered the company's senior unsecured long-term =
debt rating Monday to Baa2 from Baa1. The debt is rated triple-B-plus by St=
andard & Poor's Corp., with a negative outlook. Fitch also maintains a trip=
le-B-plus rating and it placed the debt on Rating Watch Negative late last =
week.=20
Both Fitch and Moody's cited negative investor reaction to recent company d=
evelopments. And Moody's added that its ""analysis of the developing situati=
on will focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity suppor=
t and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major count=
erparties.""=20
One money manager said he was concerned ""about the fallout and its impact o=
n the company's ability to trade"" energy.=20
The company's bonds already have suffered as a result of the uncertainty. T=
he bonds with a 6.40% coupon maturing in 2006 were offered at a dollar pric=

 a demarcation separating high-yield debt from distressed debt levels.=20
The company's bonds improved a little on Monday, to about an 83 dollar pric=
e.=20
""I'm seeing offerings but no bids,"" said Harold Rivkin, principal, H. Rivki=
n & Co., Princeton, N.J. There is a reluctance on the part of potential buy=

1632,Enron Replaces Fastow as Finance Chief 
1633,"I finished the walk through of the 15th floor space located at 1201 Louisiana this afternoon.  On the walk through with me were Paul Foust (facilities), Robert Humlicek, Jeffrey Vincent and Andrew Hawthorn.  I previously talked with Deborah Bubenko and Vincent Fox about this space.  Comments from the review are as follows:

Most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas (conference rooms etc.) included.  The floor can accommodate up to 150 people.  However, with this amount of people in the area, space will be VERY tight. Almost all offices will need to hold at least two people.  Large offices will need to hold three or four.  The larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space.  With maximum doubling up in the offices, you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area.  There are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers.

As Tommy stated in his earlier e-mail on the Allen center space, the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants. 

One area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor.  The floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor.  Some offices were locked so we could not verify the total.  However,  this number appears correct.  Also, for the most part, there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied.  Chairs, filing cabinets, credenzas, etc. would needed to be added to this space.  We need to determine where the additional furniture will come from. 

There is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle.  According to Paul, this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant.  This might work for the trading area.  The room appears to have the most telephone connectivity, is open, and would accommodate up to 11.

If we decide trader telephones are necessary (record conversations etc.), the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule.  

The floor has two data closets.  At least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to Vincent.  

This floor has the same server connectivity at the Three Allen Center space.  A 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space. 

Robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports.  However, this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete.  Probably some cabling will need to be added.  It appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers, laptops, etc.  However, if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports, additional switches can be added. 

In summary, the floor space at 1201 Louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at Three Allen Center.

1642,"The goal is to finalize the GTCs and all significant trading forms and receive UBS Warburg comments and sign-off by both legal and credit by the end of business on Friday.  To that end, Bryan Murtagh and Sanjev [Credit] are coming down to Houston tomorrow evening for meetings in EB 38C2 starting at 9:00 am on Thursday and 1:00 pm on Friday.  This timing is important in the overall rollout plan.  Peter Keohane is also coming to Houston for the meetings to make parallel changes to the Canadian forms.  

Generally, the plan is to finish the Financial GTCs, the ISDA Schedule and Collateral Support Agreement Paragraph 13 first on Thursday.  Next, we should go to the Physical Gas GTCs, the Enfolio Master and the Adoption Agreement.  Finally, we should proceed to the EEI Master and Collateral Annex.  Also, there should be a discussion of the WSPP and any other Western related issues.

On a separate track, all gas transportation and related gas agreements (most of which are non-negotiable) are being prepared by Suzanne Calcagno, Jeff Hodge, Gerald Nemec and Angela Davis.  These agreements will also require sign-off by legal and credit.  A discussion should be scheduled on Thursday or Friday.  On the power side, ERCOT issues should be discussed, but otherwise the discussion of transmission agreements etc. can wait until next week.  

Please identify all critical path issues to achieve the above-stated goal.  Thanks in advance for all the hard work!

The Kern River expansion that we backed out of (the 15 year stuff) is going to be 900,000 MMBtu/d.  As you can see a large number of the shippers stayed in the process, and are now bound to the pipe if it gets built!!

1647,"As an FYI, our DC office heard today that FERC may issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) potentially strengthening affiliate codes of conduct in the natural gas industry on June 25.  The range of outcomes could go from anywhere from simply rationalizing 497 (natural gas code of conduct) and 889 (electric code of conduct) through full divestiture (although this is highly unlikely).

If this happens, it is most directly the result of the on-going litigation at FERC surrounding El Paso Merchant's use of capacity into California.

As soon as we hear anything additional, we'll let you know.

THE HILL REPORT
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of October 7 - October 13, 2000

This Week in Washington, we witnessed a horrific tragedy in the Middle
East. This week's situation has escalated into a sad reminder of
the sacrifice our men and women in uniform make when they report
to duty each day in service to our country. Our thoughts, prayers
and support go out to their families and to all American military
men and women serving our nation all over the world.

This is also a reminder that though we are living in an era of relative
peace and prosperity, America has enemies. There is unrest in the
world and we must be prepared to do everything in our power to find
the people responsible for this heinous act and bring them to justice
swiftly. The world's brokers of terror will know there are consequences
when America is the target of their hate. We are a peace and freedom
loving people and these actions will not be tolerated against our
soldiers or our citizens.

In the United States House of Representatives we passed both the
Defense Authorization Bill and the Agriculture Appropriations bill
for fiscal year 2001.

The Defense Authorization Act, (H.R. 4205) passed by a vote of 382-31
and authorizes $309.9 billion in new budget authority for national
defense activities in FY 2001.  In honoring our commitment to our
men and women in service, this amount is $4.6 billion more than the
Clinton-Gore Administration's request.

Overall, the conference report authorizes (1) $75.8 billion for military
personnel; (2) $110.0 billion for operations and maintenance and
working capital funds, (3) $62.9 billion ($2.6 billion more than
the president's request) for weapons procurement, (4) $38.9 billion
($1.1 billion more than the president's request) for research and
development, (5) $8.8 billion ($788 million more than the president's
request) for military construction and family housing.

I strongly supported the measure and voted for it.  The bill also
provides a much needed and much deserved 3.7 percent military pay
raise and numerous bonuses and other retention and quality of life
programs.

The Agricultural Appropriations bill that also passed this week will
help farmers and producers of livestock and dairy who are suffering
another year of weather and financial losses, including an additional
provision that lifts limits to $150,000 this crop year on Loan Deficiency
Payments (LDPs) and provides the first move to re-opening for agricultural
trade into Cuba.

On Thursday, by a vote of 340 to 75, the House approved H.R. 4461,
the Agricultural Appropriations Act, with the Senate expected to
follow within the week.

Producers suffering a series of harvest losses due to weather extremes
will be able to draw upon funding that provides as much help as possible,
by providing upwards of $1.6 billion for crops - beyond USDA's recent
$1.3 billion estimate.

A prescription drug importation measure was also included in the
bill and will become law as part of the Agriculture Appropriations
Act for Fiscal Year 2001. I hailed the measure as a victory for seniors.

This is great news for America's seniors.  I have always said that
the world's best consumers should not be paying the world's highest
prices. This week we passed a bill to change that.

Currently, seniors in Texas and across the country are paying as
much as 70% more for prescription drugs than their counterparts in
other countries. For example, in 1998, a 30-day supply of ""Prilosec""
cost about $99.95 in Texas but that same 30-day supply was a mere
$17.50 in Mexico.

I strongly support giving seniors more choices in their health care
options but warned that increased choices means increased responsibility.
 Millions of seniors wanted to be able to buy prescription drugs
from Canada and Mexico in order to save money on some drugs.  This
bill does that for them but seniors must be aware of the safety concerns
associated with getting drugs from other countries.

Around Texas...

Tomorrow, I will hold a town hall meeting in Mexia,  and following
the town hall meeting there will be a ""Cancer Society Walk for Life"".
 And next week, I will be in Bryan for a Town Hall Meeting.  See
the notices at the end of this e-mail.

Have a great weekend! - Pete

Dan Eilers of Vanguard Venture Partners contacted me last week to see if 
Enron would be interested in a high level discussion of the changes occurring 
in electricity generation and management technologies.  Vanguard is an early 
stage VC fund that helped create Ciena and Network Appliance.  Dan is a new 
partner and is looking at the energy market as a new focus for Vanguard.  

He would like to have a brainstorming session with an eye on creating a 
cooperative relationship between Vanguard and Enron for the evaluation and 
development of new companies in the energy arena.

I would appreciate it if you could respond with your interest level so I 
could arrange a time that is convenient for each of you to participate.

is a satisfactory time for the phone call.  That appears to be the only 
window he has next week.

Valerie had already sent the SEC Panel Outline on 4/11, which you attached

We have finally been able to track down a resume for Nelson Steele.  Based 
upon his resume he is not someone we would have invited to interview for the 
Analyst Program.  We have also spoken to the Portland Office regarding the 
interview that Nelson had with them.  According to Amy Fitzpatrick, the HR 
Rep in Portland, when he interviewed he was extremely unimpressive.  
Consequently, he was not extended an offer by the Portland Office.  When they 
called to tell him such, his response was, ""that's OK because I did not want 
to work there anyway.""

I am doubtful that he will fare well in the interview process but will bring 
him in if that is what is desired.  Please let me know how you wish for us to 
proceed.  Thanks.

SONATRACH ASK FOR PATIENCE OVER OZ2 PIPELINE CONTRACTS
Algiers - Sonatrach has asked bidders to extend until the end of 2000 offers
made for the $1bn OZ2 pipeline system, designed to extend the capacity of
the crude oil corridor from the central el_hamra oil field to the Arzew
terminal west of Algiers. The extension will allow the company more time to
evaluate the bids
About six companies/groups are understood to be bidding for the three
contracts which are estimated to be worth $220-250m each. They include CCC;
a consortium of Bonatti, with Entrepose and Dragados & Construcciones and
Bechtel. The first two contracts involve the construction of the pipelines
with a third contract for six pumping stations. The recent political changes
in Algeria, combined with internal administrative changes in Sonatrach, are
said to have contributed to the delay.


OIL PRICES RISE OVER ISRAELI CONFLICT
London - Oil prices soared on global markets last night following rising
tensions in the Middle East.
London Brent blend futures rose 72 cents to $31.48 but remains short of a
10-year high $34.98 touched last month. US light crude was up 92 cents at
$32.79 helped by speculators returning to buy oil after a two-week sell-off.
Following Saudi Arabia's warning that Riyadh and other Arab states would not
""watch with their hands tied"" if Israel attacked Lebanon or Syria, the cost
of a barrel of crude went up almost a dollar to $32.79 (o22.60) in New York.
Earlier the International Energy Agency set alarm bells ringing when it said
the West was heading into winter with inventories well below the seasonal
norm.
Oil prices have retreated from their 10-year peaks last month after pressure
from the G7 industrial nations on producers to pump more crude and the US
decision to release 30m barrels from its strategic reserve. After briefly
dipping below $30, prices have risen amid concerns that demand will exceed
supply in the coming months, particularly if the violence in Israel leads to
a broader conflict. Oil prices are seen as a threat to the prospects of low
inflation in the West, and yesterday's increases spilled over into bond
markets, where worries about Wall Street and energy shortages had already
driven yields higher.
A wave of violence between Palestinians and Israelis over the past 12 days
has killed at least 90 people, mostly Palestinians.


BUY-BACK TERMS SET TO CHANGE
Tehran - In an interview with Petroleum Argus this month, Mehdi Hosseini,
former Deputy Oil Minister for international Affairs and now Managing
Director at Kala, the procurement arm of NIOC based in London, indicated
that future negotiations with foreign oil companies will take place using
more favourable terms.
NIOC is reportedly close to implementing a more attractive buy-back formula.
Since the Islamic Republic re-opened its doors to foreign oil companies in
1997, executives had quietly bemoaned the buy-back formula as offering small
capital returns on huge investments. Despite this, Iran's energy buy-back
projects have so far attracted close to $10bn capital to the Iranian energy
sector. NIOC argues that it is their duty to negotiate terms favourable to
its population rather than to foreign entities. It now appears that in the
face of increased competition for foreign investment from its Gulf
neighbours, NIOC is prepared to compromise. For further details please visit

THE LAST MILE TO ... SOMEWHERE?
By Tim Laseter, Martha Turner, Anne Chung, and Pat Houston

New York, Oct 17, 2000- Last week's announcement that the Web-based e-tailer 
and delivery service Urbanfetch was discontinuing its business-to-consumer 
operation came as no surprise to us. As we pointed out in the August issue of 
strategy+business, such companies -- highflyers Kozmo.com, Webvan, and 
HomeGrocer among them -- face limited online sales potential, high cost of 
delivery, a speed-variety trade-off, and existing, entrenched competition. 
""We believe the last mile may lead to the gallows rather than to the promised 
land,"" we wrote.

Since that article appeared, Webvan acquired HomeGrocer, Kozmo cancelled its 
plans for an initial public offering, and Urbanfetch closed its core 
business. Are we gloating over our prescience? Not at all. We think all these 
moves are signs of maturity -- and indications that one or more players may 
develop a winning business model.

News from Los Angeles in the Los Angeles Times
Riordan to Join L.A. Unified After He Leaves City Hall
 <<...>> Mayor: In an address to Valley leaders, he strongly denounces
secession, then makes surprising disclosure about plan to take executive
post with district.
By JIM NEWTON, Times Staff Writer


In his final annual address on the state of the San Fernando Valley, Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday delivered his most forceful call
ever for that area to remain part of the larger city, then surprised the
audience by announcing that he will go to work for the Los Angeles Unified
School District when he finishes his term in office.
Speaking to a group of Valley business leaders, Riordan denounced secession
on political, moral and practical grounds, warning that it would force a tax
hike, leave the Valley with uncertain leadership and abandon the city's
poor.
""I love the Valley,"" Riordan said. ""I feel that you're part of the family,
and I don't want you to desert the family. . . . The rest of the city needs
you. You can't abandon the poor. It just isn't right.""
Riordan's pointed rejection of secession represents a significant escalation
in his efforts to head off that politically charged prospect--a topic so
heated that in a mayoral debate following Riordan's speech, not one of the
six candidates angling for election in April so much as mentioned the word.
Riordan, by contrast, tackled the issue head-on and in far more
confrontational terms than he ever has before.
""Secession,"" Riordan said bluntly, ""is a lousy idea.""
As significant as that pronouncement was, however, the mayor almost
overshadowed it with an offhand personal remark in response to a question
after his speech. Asked to elaborate on his thoughts about breaking up the
school district, Riordan let slip that he intends to go to work for L.A.
Unified after he finishes his second term as mayor, which ends next summer.
The mayor, who helped elect four of the school board's seven members, said
he has been in discussions with Supt. Roy Romer and has agreed to accept an
""executive position"" with the district next year. Riordan did not elaborate,
but in an interview later, he said he and the superintendent had agreed that
Riordan would run the district's classroom computer program.
The former Colorado governor, who now runs the city's schools, was not
immediately available for comment.
At the district, Riordan said, he will be in charge of working with schools
to make effective use of computers in the classroom. Riordan, who has
donated thousands of computers to schools in various parts of the country,
said the job fit his talents. ""I think this is something I'm good at,"" he
said. ""I know the experts in the field.""
Riordan's post-mayoral plans have for months been the object of much
speculation. Most observers predicted he would do something in the field of
education, because no topic animates Riordan as much as children and
schools.
But Riordan is a multimillionaire, and he will be over 70 when he finishes
his second term as mayor. He passed up the chance to run for governor in
1998, and some friends had predicted he would slow down when he wrapped up
his mayoral administration.
The idea of a quiet retirement, however, seems to have little appeal for
Riordan, an energetic and restless man. Asked how long he intended to take
off between finishing his work as mayor and starting his new job at the
school district, Riordan responded: ""three or four hours.""
Riordan has held office for nearly eight years, and for that entire time has
enjoyed the strong support of the San Fernando Valley. It was the Valley
that helped put him in office in 1993, and polls since have shown that
though he is popular citywide, he enjoys his greatest approval ratings north
of the Hollywood Hills.
As the race to succeed him gathers steam, some of the candidates clearly
covet Riordan's base in the Valley.
On Friday, City Councilman Joel Wachs often invoked the mayor's name during
a low-energy debate among the six leading mayoral candidates. Among other
things, Wachs praised Riordan's economic development initiatives and his
handling of the recently completed negotiations between the city and federal
government over the future of the Los Angeles Police Department.
So effusive was Wachs in his praise of Riordan that eventually businessman
Steve Soboroff complained. As Soboroff pointed out to the audience, Riordan
has endorsed his candidacy, not Wachs'. Soboroff suggested that his rival
withdraw from the race and back him instead.
Wachs laughed, but did not respond.
The debate--really more of a panel discussion in which the candidates rarely
addressed one another, while sitting cheek-by-jowl in straight-backed
chairs--also was notable as the first joint appearance of the candidates to
include state Controller Kathleen Connell, the latest contender to join the
race.
Connell used her debut debate performance to stress her determination to
bring tough fiscal management to the problems of Los Angeles. She addressed
issues such as police corruption, transportation and the city's business
climate in terms of their economic impact, arguing that her experience in
the private sector and as controller made her the right person to handle
that task.
In other debate highlights, City Atty. James Hahn and Assemblyman Antonio
Villaraigosa enthusiastically welcomed the signing of the consent decree
with the federal government on police reform.
Connell, Wachs and U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra also applauded the deal, though
in less glowing terms.
Soboroff was the only candidate to oppose it, calling it an abdication of
local responsibility.

We learned today that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has modified its opinion of August 9, 2000 in which it found the 2003 Prozac patent invalid for double patenting.  In essence, the Court has again ruled that the patent is invalid for double patenting, but has used a different analysis to reach this conclusion.   
We intend to seek legal review of today's decision.  Although it is possible that the legal review process could delay Barr from entering the market on August 3, we continue to plan for Barr launching generic fluoxetine at that time. 
On a related note, in our current litigation with Zenith/Reddy-Cheminor, Zenith used the prior Barr decision to allege that the olanzapine patent was invalid for double patenting. The reversal of the August 9 decision removes that argument from Zenith's presentation of its case.   
Attached to this message are copies of press releases issued by Lilly and Barr regarding the CAFC's decision. 
    
Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions in this regard.

November 20, 2001-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in pricing and revenue optimization science and software, today announced a series of Energy Profit Optimization Web Seminars for the natural gas pipeline, storage, and trading industries in December.

PROS cordially invites you to attend this series which is scheduled as a set of four seminars as follows:

o December 6th: Storage Profit Optimization for Storage Traders, 3:30 - 4:30 pm Central Time
o December 7th: Trading Profit Optimization, 2:00 - 3:00 pm Central Time

Recently, a Wall Street analyst was quoted: ""By 2001, companies that neglect to implement yield management techniques will become uncompetitive.""  PROS Revenue Management solutions have been credited with delivering 6-8% incremental revenue and 20-100% incremental profits.   These Web seminars will allow industry leaders to learn from the experience PROS has gained in over 16 years of deploying these solutions.

These seminars will cover the basics of increasing revenues and profits while providing insight on how real-time data can be used to forecast demand elasticity and optimize profits.  Participants of previous PROS seminars have found these sessions to be extremely helpful in improving their business and making them more valuable to their respective organizations.

The Web format will allow participants to attend from remote locations, ask questions in real-time, and interact with the presenter through an Internet browser and toll-free telephone number.

1796,"They looked unbeatable. The Devils looked like shit but if the Avs play like
that, there is no way they will be beat. Tonight will be a big game.

1798,"Coach Jim Haslett had put together the perfect
New Orleans Saints team.
The only thing he was missing was a good quarterback.

He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools,
but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback
who could ensure a Super Bowl win.

Then one night, while watching CNN,
he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia.
In one corner of the screen,
he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly
incredible arm.
He threw a hand grenade straight
into a 15th-story window 200 yards away
--ka-boom!

""I've got to get this guy!""  Haslett said to himself.
""He has the perfect arm!""
So, he brings the kid to the New Orleans
and teaches him the great game of football,
and the Saints go on to win the Super Bowl
for the first time in history.

The young Bosnian is ""canonized""
as the Great Hero of football,
and when Haslett asks him what he wants,
all the young man wants to do
is to call his mother.
""Mom,"" he says into the phone,
""I just won the Super Bowl.""
""I don't want to talk to you,"" the old woman says.
""You deserted us.  You are not my son.""
""I don't think you understand, Mother!"" the young man pleads.
""I just won the greatest sporting event in the world.
I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.""
""No, let me tell you,"" the mother retorts.
""At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us.
The neighborhood is a pile of rubble.
Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday,
and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight.""
The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says ""
 ...I'll never forgive you for making us move to
New Orleans.""

"
1799,"Here is the forecast.  Our meeting using these numbers won't be until 
tomorrow so they will most likely change shortly.


"
1800,"way to show up for the game.  we had to get a ringer, but she was pretty 
good.  she is one of those softball freaks that goes out every tues night 
looking to pick up games."
1801,"i thought you were going to say you thought of the witty comeback the next 
morning when you both woke up."

Previous Session's Best Performing Alert

One of Monday's Before the Bell Alerts Human Genome Sciences Inc.=20
(HGSI) gained 9 points after our alert. RealTimeTraders.com offers free=20
real-time stock alerts throughout the day. Why pay for=20
chat rooms and stock pickers for old news?



Morning Watch List

This section contains 6 stocks that are expected move in 1 to 5 days.=20
Click here for this morning's Watch List Stocks:=20
http://www.realtimetraders.com/realtimetraders/marketinfo/watchlist.asp



Beyond The Numbers

Monday=01,s action resembles the good old days

Monday morning futures indicated for a very sharp opening. Markets=20
gapped open higher and traded lower due to the continued uncertainty=20
in the political front. However, shortly after dipping into the negative=20
territory, buyers stepped up to drive the markets higher again. Strength=20
in technology stocks helped Nasdaq outpace the blue-chip index.=20
Nasdaq finished the session higher by 97 points to close above the=20
3000 mark. Blue-chip index for its part finished the session higher by=20
only 12 points, thanks only to the strength in Intel and Microsoft. Monday,=
=20
as tech stocks picked up momentum old economy stocks went out of=20
favor. It is worth noting that we saw the same pattern of trading many=20
months ago when Nasdaq was in favor.?=20

Federal Reserve=01,s actions will take time to produce results

Monday=01,s =01&Market Analysis=018 explained why a change in interest rate=
s=20
by the FED may take many quarters to produce any meaningful effects.=20
This was clearly evident when the Federal Reserve raised rates 6 times=20
beginning last June 1999 to slowdown the economy. As our readers=20
may realize the effects of all those rate hikes were not evident up until=
=20
recently. Which implies that buying stocks in anticipation of a rate hike=
=20
may not translate into a sustainable long-term rally.

Plenty of problems ahead

Monday more companies pre-announced negative earnings for their =20
upcoming quarters. We like to remind our readers there are still many=20
weeks left for pre-announcements. We at Realtimetraders.com expect=20
this quarter=01,s pre-announcements to exceed last quarter's. We also=20
believe the earnings picture for US companies to be mixed with a=20
negative bias for the next few quarters.



Sector Analysis

Momentum is starting to build in technology stocks

Despite the problems in the economy, the oversold technology stocks=20
are setting the stage for a Santa Claus rally. In Monday`s market=20
analysis we wrote of several reasons why we expect the markets to=20
see an upside move in the next few weeks. Given Monday=01,s upside=20
move in tech stocks and the fact the tech index (Nasdaq) managed to =20
close above the initial resistance level of 3000 is yet another reason=20
that leads us to believe the markets may be setting the stage for a =20
rally in the next few weeks.

Semiconductor and biotech Indices are heading higher again

Some of our readers may recall that semiconductor and biotech were=20
the 2 strongest sectors that powered the Nasdaq index to record levels=20
in early 2000. Monday=01,s best performing sectors were the 2 former=20
high-fliers. Given the momentum that is building in these sectors, it is=20
a good idea to watch these 2 sectors and the Nasdaq as a whole in=20
the next few weeks.



Economic Reports & Bond Markets

Bond markets remain quiet

As the equity markets have been rallying in the past few sessions,=20
bonds have been trading in a range. Monday long bond finished the=20
session lower by 2 ticks at 103.08. There are no major economic=20
reports due out on Tuesday.




Market Breadth=20

Monday's NYSE advance/decline reading was 1669/1181 Vs.=20
Friday's reading of2076/816
Monday's Nasdaq advance/decline reading was 2308/1673 Vs.=20
Friday's reading of 2818/1146

1834,"Jenna Myers Scouting Report
January 2002
Sponsored by TechnoScout,
Where technology hits home.

Imagine this. You lean back in your seat as the symphony begins. The overture begins by the string section, with a soothing melody. In comes the brass, with high, piercing treble, followed by percussion, with teeth-rattling bass. Your eyes closed, you sink into your chair and let the rich sound fill your head. Suddenly, the phone on your desk rings. You realize you are not at Carnegie Hall, you're at your office? and that's not a symphony orchestra, it's the new Aiwa Digital Audio System.
http://offer.technoscout.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eN8y0DlbdP0GZt0eGW0AC

Can you experience surround sound using just two speakers? Q-Surround proves it's possible. Using unique signal processing algorithms based on advanced psychoacoustics, Q-surround circuitry creates a ""phantom"" center channel, expands the front left and right soundfield and places ""virtual"" surround speakers around you to simulate the effect of a multi-channel system. Aiwa portable stereos with Q-Surround are capable of delivering a rich, all-encompassing soundfield that recreates the ""you are there"" experience as no conventional compact two-speaker system can.

Superior design, surprising sound. The Aiwa Digital Audio System
http://offer.technoscout.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eN8y0DlbdP0GZt0eGW0AC
synthesizes the latest acoustic technology with practical features and attractive design. The wood cabinet blends with nearly any d?cor, and its robust construction results in enhanced sound reproduction. Independent, tuned bass reflex speaker enclosures provide tighter bass response, and the 3/4-inch baffle board helps eliminate any resonance within the speaker enclosure. It features 10 Watts per Channel (20 total), and the Super T-Bass delivers deep and powerful bass sound without the ""boominess"" that characterizes systems with less sophisticated low-frequency enhancement circuits. That's because Super T-Bass was specifically engineered to improve the low-end performance of small speakers, taking into account their particular resonance characteristics.


Cutting-edge commitment. Since being founded in 1951, Aiwa has been a leader in the field of consumer electronics and acoustic technology. This explains the company's record of ""firsts,"" including making Japan's first cassette tape recorder, Japan's first stereo cassette deck, the first company to manufacture digital audio tape (DAT) products, the first to market a recording headphone stereo and a leader in mini-systems. This same commitment to cutting edge technology has enabled Aiwa to create the gold standard in portable CD stereos.

Great sound is only the beginning. The Aiwa Digital Audio System http://offer.technoscout.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eN8y0DlbdP0GZt0eGW0AC
also incorporates the latest features for functionality and convenience. The Full Logic Mechanism with Auto-Reverse provides for smoother, less clumsy operation.  Unlike many comparable units made by other manufacturers, this one is compatible with CDs made with a recorder or computer, like CD-R/RW. The CD player has Repeat, Random and Programmed play, and the AM/FM Stereo has 30-station preset memory and Digitally Synthesized tuning for locking in stations. There is even a preset equalizer with selectable modes for Pop, Rock and Jazz.

Try it factory-direct, risk-free. Thanks to our special relationship with the manufacturer, we can offer it with a special payment plan and our exclusive risk-free trial. Order today, and if you are not completely satisfied for any reason, simply return it within 30 days for a full refund of the purchase price.

Call toll-free 24 hours a day 1-800-566-4157 and mention promotional code 80492.

Week Ending June 8, 2001

IN THIS ISSUE:
* Company Highlight : Learncom, Inc.(OTCBB - LRCM)
* This Week's Top 10 News Links

COMPANY SPOTLIGHT : Learncom, Inc.

Lloyd Singer, President and CEO of Learncom
(OTCBB: LRCM - news) in an open letter to
shareholders provided the following recap of its
strategy and progress since the company started its
business in January, 1999:

Said Singer: ""Our goal is to become the major
supplier of soft skills training resources and
related services in the highly fractionated $60
billion training industry. From humble beginnings,
with just twelve employees - all shareholders or option
holders - housed in our warehouse in Bensenville,
Illinois, we've been successful in acquiring four
synergistic product-centric businesses with copyright
or distribution rights to several thousand training
videos, CD-ROMs and e-learning courses. Two other
acquisitions are anticipated for 2001.

The same low overhead, flat organization approach to
the business that we started with has been a cornerstone
of our corporate culture. Build the salespower. Encourage
cross-selling. Reduce the redundant overheads inherent in
an acquisition strategy. Everybody an owner.

The first acquisition in January, 1999 included the high
quality video assets (several hundred titles) of
WingsNet, Inc. and provided the foundation to get the
business started. By midyear, '99 we were cash neutral
on just $750,000 in sales and provided our backers with
the confidence to fund further growth.

In August, 1999, we acquired the stock of BNA
Communications, a 50 year producer/distributor of
high quality video courseware specializing in harassment
prevention, diversity and employment law. The company
had been a subsidiary of The Bureau of National Affairs,
the large Washington, D.C. publisher and information
provider to the legal and HR professions.

The business also included a start-up consulting
practice in the same subject areas. The top ten video
courses all had generated sales in excess of $2 million
in revenue - a very strong result in our business. As
announced a few weeks ago, we're now preparing
the release of A WINNING BALANCE II, the
sequel to the title of the same name which has generated
revenues of over $5 million and is believed to be the
best selling diversity course in history. These courses
have been produced by ProGroup, Inc. a leading
consulting company in the diversity area.

Another major change we've made with the BNAC
business model is the sales approach. For years,
BNAC had rejected the ``open'' sales model used in the
training business. In this model, titles are sold by
the producer's own sales staff as well as through other
distributors. LearnCom has just signed a
non-exclusive deal with a small, but highly
productive distributor to sell BNAC best-sellers.
In addition, LearnCom's other sales units will be
selling BNAC courses. Ultimately we expect to roll
out the product to more than 200 distributors with
300 salespeople. Early results are encouraging from
these decisions..

In January, 2001, we acquired the stock of venerable
distributor, VideoLearning Systems, Inc. (VLS).
This deal provided an additional eight salespeople,
and three excellent managers. Integration is proceeding
on schedule. VLS is on track to generate $2.5 million
in revenue in 2001.

In March, we announced ""agreement in principle"" to
acquire the trainseek.com website, www.trainseek.com.
This huge B2B site, which provides access to over
one million training titles across the broad spectrum
of platforms and formats is expected to become
the main marketing engine for the company. With
over 19,000 visitors monthly and its large
e-mail list, we can now sell the largest product
line ever assembled in the training industry to the
largest potential customer base. TrainSeek, Inc.
had invested over $7 million in developing the site
and establishing the brand. This deal is
expected to close in early July.

Next up for 2001 is a distribution deal that has the
potential to double our size to the $11million level.
More importantly, on a proforma basis, we'll have the
scale to break into the black...a key goal for management
since we opened our doors in that warehouse just 30
months ago. Last week, we announced the $4 million
fund-raising that will facilitate closing of the new
transaction as well as providing capital for additional
transactions and working capital for sales, marketing
and product development.

I'm pleased but not complacent with our progress.
This is all about dedicated people, all owners or
owners-to-be working to serve thousands of customers
with an outstanding lineup of training products and
services that enhance employee performance in thousands
of companies. This is also about stockholders who
continue to have faith in our Vision and Growth.""

1870,"CMS, DEFS Swap Strategic Properties

In a strategic move said to benefit both midstream energy companies, CMS 
Field Services Inc. has swapped some of its natural gas assets in Oklahoma 
and Kansas for some of Duke Energy Field Services' similar assets onshore and 
offshore Louisiana. 

DEFS' natural gas gathering and condensate measuring and transportation 
assets onshore and offshore Louisiana were exchanged with CMS Field Services' 
assets in Oklahoma and Kansas, giving each company more proximity to their 
other assets. The deal closed Dec. 20 and was announced Friday. No financial 
details were disclosed. 

""This transaction makes both strategic and economic sense for CMS Energy,"" 
said Tim Young, senior vice president of the field services division. In 
1999, CMS Energy acquired Duke Energy's Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. and 
Trunkline Gas Co., and Young said the swap gives CMS more opportunities to 
offer enhanced services to ""existing and potential shippers"" on CMS-owned 
properties along the Gulf Coast. 

In the deal, CMS obtained 10 offshore gas gathering laterals, a one-third 
ownership in the Atchafalaya Pipeline System and complete ownership in a 
Patterson, LA condensate measuring facility. The 10 offshore gas gathering 
laterals are connected to two offshore pipelines owned by CMS Energy: the 
Trunkline Gas Co.'s Terrebonne system and the Sea Robin Pipeline Co. The 
39-mile-long Atchafalaya Pipeline receives condensate from the Terrebonne 
system, while the Patterson measurement facility measures condensate 
transported through the Atchafalaya pipe. 

In return, Denver-based DEFS, a subsidiary of Duke Energy and Phillips 
Petroleum, obtained two Midcontinent natural gas gathering systems: the 
Bradshaw system in Kansas and the Roaring Creek system in Oklahoma. DEFS also 
will pick up the Miles Hampton and Ulysses systems in Kansas and the 
Christmas Lateral in South Texas. 

""These assets are a great strategic fit with our assets in the area, as they 
will specifically supply to plants with existing capacity,"" said Michael 
Bradley, senior vice president, DEFS' northern division. Bradley said the 
asset exchange supported the company's growth strategy ""optimizing and 
rationalizing assets"" and giving the company more flexibility. 

CMS Field Services supplies regions of Louisiana, the Texas Gulf Coast, West 
Texas, Central Texas, the Midcontinent and the Rocky Mountains, and owns 
approximately 5,000 miles of gathering pipeline. DEFS, 70% owned by Duke and 
30% by Phillips, operates in 11 states and across five of the largest natural 
gas producing regions in North America. It owns and operates 71 plants and 
57,000 miles of pipe, with operating territory extending from western Canada 
to the Gulf Coast.

UnBound provides software architecture  that creates the connection between

to extend our e-commerce services beyond the desktop  to a wireless user 
through a customized, wireless interface (pagers, cell phones, etc.).  We 
have set a meeting with Unbound for next Wednesday.

Fuel Monetization
Implementation cost estimates are being finalized as customer interest is 
being evaluated for this potential service option.  Duke, Southern, and 
Reliant are all interested but only if they can have first call on the space 
created.  El Paso Merchant Energy is expected to provide Transwestern a 
proposal, early next week, for the potential monetization of the fuel 
component for their company's transportation contracts totaling 65,000 Dth/d 
of San Juan to California capacity.

Southern Company Energy Marketing
John Hogan was in town this week.  Southern has advanced to the second round 
of bidding on Nevada Power's generation assets which are scheduled to be sold 
off by the end of this year.  SCEM's Gallup agreement allows them to deliver 
to the new SWG delivery point on an alternate basis, but if Southern is 
successful in obtaining any of Nevada Power's gen assets, they may request to 
amend the delivery point on their Gallup contract.  SCEM is also very 
interested in any expansions TW may have in the near future.  Due to their 
affiliation with Vastar, they have a definite appetite for more San Juan to 
CA or NV transport.

Southern is interested in the possibility of buying options for capacity on 
TW and we requested that he get his regulatory group familiar with the idea 
in hopes that SCEM would support of our filing.

SCEM also plans to trigger its ROFR on their Ignacio to Blanco capacity 
(30,000/d) by the 7/1 deadline.

Duke
They have triggered their ROFR on the Ignacio to Blanco capacity (18,000/d) 
and this capacity will be posted on the Internet per TW's tariff the week of 
7/3.

Pueblo Project
Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson was excoriated this week in front of 
Senate panels reviewing his and the DOE's conduct regarding the missing 
computer hard drives at Los Alamos.  Since the Pueblo project hinged on the 
ability of Richardson to use his Secretarial discretion to create this sole 
source contract, with limited review by Congress, we can rest assured 
Congressional support for Richardson or any of his pet projects is 
non-existent.

Miscellaneous

1877,"Note:  There will be a briefing meeting on the project in Denver on Nov. 14

N. Border Plans Extension to Tap Powder River Basin

Powder River Basin gas producers may be about to get a more direct route to 
Midwest markets. Northern Border Pipeline has released plans to build a new 
325-mile greenfield pipeline from McCabe, MT, to Gillette, WY, to tap the 
rapidly growing production in the Powder River, which is estimated to hold 
between 10 and 30 Tcf of gas. 

The basin's rapid production growth has captured the attention of the 
industry, with numerous proposed pipelines, including several new interstate 
plans that would bring gas to the Midcontinent gas grid. Northern Border's 
project, called the Bison Pipeline, would add a new route out of the basin 
for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production starting in November 
2003. The pipeline is holding an open season on the proposal through Dec. 5. 

Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC and 
Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bi-directional interconnect accessing Williston 
Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker storage field also is proposed. 

The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with 
direct access to several local distribution companies, including 
Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, 
People Gas and Nipsco. It also provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern, 
NGPL, Northern and Vector. 

The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/d, but a negotiated 10-year 
demand rate cuts 4 cents off that. The pipeline is offering 
""mileage-sensitive rates,"" which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor 
supply access and optimize transportation value. 

Northern Border plans to hold a briefing on the project in Denver on Nov. 14. 
For more information, contact project director Paul Miller in Omaha, NB, at 
(402) 398-7758 or James Hoff in Denver at (303) 575-6475, or see the 
pipeline's Web site at www.northernborderpartners.com. "

1881,"Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. 
Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline)
has been the only pipeline into this market.  


NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis

Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 
47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored 
by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will 
add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis 
market. 

""The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing 
strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets 
currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by 
adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,"" said Richard D. 
Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. 

The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is 
scheduled for completion in June of 2002. 

NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and 
storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, 
which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In 
addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation 
agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf 
Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. 

The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area 
that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company 
[Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, 
president of Illinois Power. ""This new connection to Illinois Power's system 
will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the 
metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point 
to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the 
area. 

""The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy 
provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,"" said Deb 
Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest 
from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season 
will determine the final scope of the project. 

""With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the 
St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of 
interest,"" said Macdonald. ""We anticipate a strong response, however, given 
the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power 
generation."" 

Interested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business 
development, at (630) 691-3347.

Transwestern Pipeline Company 
"
1888,"
While recent events have dramatically impacted Enron's travel volume,
Alliance Worldwide (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) wanted to contact
you regarding the Enron Travel Program.  Since 1984, our company has been a
strategic business partner with Enron and has provided a complete scope of
services from booking, ticketing, ticket delivery, customer service,
reporting, management of ClickTrip, to facilitating preferred vendor
arrangements with airlines to benefit Enron.    These services have been
provided on a management fee basis from Alliance to Enron.  As of December
1, 2001 the management fee has been suspended during Enron's period of
reorganization.  We are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to
Enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing
fee per ticket.  

To provide you with a brief history of our arrangement, Enron and Alliance
approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront
discounts for Enron's business travel.  These discounts are available only
through Alliance and are given at time of ticketing.  All commissions were
stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to Enron, in
exchange for Enron paying Alliance a contracted management fee.  This
management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each Enron cost center
based on the total number of transactions.  This travel program provided
Enron over $8.6 million in airline savings on $55 million spent in the year
2000 and over $5.2 million on $33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of
2001.  These savings are after the payment of the travel agency management
fee.    

The effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by
the airlines cannot yet be determined.  We have contacted the airline
companies and most of Enron's preferred carriers have agreed to extend the
contracts through April 2002.  You may utilize these discounts through
Alliance by calling 713 650-8080 or 1 800 962-0248.  In March, Enron and
Alliance will begin evaluating Enron's volume and travel patterns, and
determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure.


As mentioned earlier, Alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in
lieu of a management fee.  These fees are reimbursable to Enron employees
through normal expense report procedures.  Specifically, the new fee
structure is based on zero-commission contracts for tickets purchased from
Enron's preferred carriers.  The fee schedule for all airline tickets for
Enron travel is as follows:

$30 - Domestic tickets with or without upfront discount
$30 - International tickets without upfront discount
25% of Savings, capped at $175 - International tickets with upfront discount
$15 - Southwest Airlines and ClickTrip Reservations, Hotel/Car Only Bookings

The savings to Enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees
that are charged.  For example, Enron's average ticket prices are $589
domestic and $2207 international (after discounts). Enron's average savings
are $144 domestic and $587 international (before fees).  The savings are
more than three times the per ticket fee!

If you are accustomed to booking your own travel online, you may continue to
do so by booking through ClickTrip.  ClickTrip is the only online booking
tool that allows access to Enron's negotiated discounts.  Ticketing through
ClickTrip also bears a smaller fee of $15 if no agent assistance is
necessary.  There is no charge to look at schedules.   ClickTrip is
available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through Enron's intranet site
<http://travel.enron.com> or via the Internet site
<http://www.resassist.com/enron/>.  ClickTrip is also a useful tool for
checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status.  To check upgrade
status or to review a ticketed itinerary, simply click the Check My Trip
button on the ClickTrip home page and fill in your name and Amadeus locator
number (provided at the top of your itinerary).  A user log-in may be
obtained by contacting Alliance at 713 328-5100.

If your office location, phone number or any profile information has
changed, please notify us by return email.  A profile form is attached if
you prefer to fax the information to Alliance at 713 328-5600 or if you are
a new traveler wishing to set up a profile.

We at Alliance are proud of our 17 year association with Enron and dedicated
to ensuring you of the best possible service at the most economical price
for all of your travel needs.  We have a highly trained and experienced
staff working on Enron's account and we look forward to providing you with
continued service for years to come.  
If you have any questions regarding any of the changes mentioned, or wish to
discuss specific details relating to your corporate travel policies, please

write something from scratch.  Instead of trading several emails with

call myself to come up with something acceptable to the both of us which also 
meets your requirements below.  (I'm thinking that the actual scope items 
should be in your change order and GE's requirements/recommendations for the 
future modifications can be attached -- Much the same way their standard 
specs are attached to a purchase contract. )

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle
By Mark Lake 

New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers, seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP. 

``I was approached by several people to invest in the company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined 95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good investment, he said. 

Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B. Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an acquisition by Dynegy Inc. 

The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing, jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take place. 

Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about 55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5 percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years. 

Declining to Invest 

J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments, which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more than two weeks. 

Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We are not in discussions with Enron about financing.'' 

``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet, which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her portfolio invested in Dynegy shares. 

Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people close to the discussions. 

Terms 

``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers the energy market for Deutsche Bank. 

Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.'' 

Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings to 75 cents a share from $1.65. 

Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships. 

Cash Question 

``The main question is: `What is the cash position right now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash position of the company stabilizing or not?'' 

Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the developments.

1974,"Dear Turbine Torture Club Members:

The purpose of this email is to confirm that we will have a conference call 
this Wednesday, November 29 at 130 CT.  The following items have been 
suggested for the agenda:

Form of consent to assignment agreement (draft circulated) - to be used for 
LM's and Frames, if possible.
Assignment language - new language being tortured within the Enron ranks, to 
GE soon.
Limit of liability, indemnity, etc. - Enron owes GE a position on this.

In addition, it seems to me that the following equipment will be ""moving"" 
soon:

City of Austin LM's (to be assigned to ENA, then NEPCO)
LM's for the ESA project 
PSCO, LV CoGen, the remaining LM's, Pastoria, Blue Dog (all to DevCo, right?) 

I suggest that we address any commercial, financial or legal issues

additional issues.  Please advise.

We note in the Assignment of Interest document sent yesterday, there is a

We need to perform due diligence on what those obligations are and whether
they have changed since the SPA was executed.  We need the following
information for determining what obligations VLDC has incurred:

1)  financial statements of the LLC
What debts does the LLC owe and to whom?
2)  list of all the agreements entered into by the company

Below is assignment language that we used in our going master before we 
entered into the era of the off balance sheet structures.  I do not recall 
whether we have the subcontract assignability language.  I question whether 
we need 22.3. 


This Agreement or any right or obligation contained herein may be assigned by 
Purchaser without Seller's consent to:

 (i) an Affiliate;

 (ii) a Joint Venture, Partnership, or other similar entity in which 
Purchaser or Purchaser's Affiliate is a venturer, partner or participant;

 (iii) Owner;

 (iv) Lender; or

 (v) to any entity for the purposes of financing or sale of the Facility.

Except for (i) through (v) above, this Agreement may be assigned by Purchaser 
to other parties only upon the prior written consent of Seller which shall 
not be unreasonably withheld.  When duly assigned in accordance with the 
foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the 
benefit of the assignee; any other assignment by Purchaser shall be void and 
without force or effect.

22.3   Agreement with Lender.  Seller agrees that if requested by Purchaser, 
Seller shall enter into a direct agreement with Lender under which Lender is 
permitted to ""step into"" this Agreement.

22.4   Assignment of Vendor Agreements.  All Seller's subcontracts with 
Vendor which have prices equal to or greater than $500,000 shall include 
provisions giving Seller an unrestricted right to assign the relevant 
subcontract and call benefits, interests, rights and cause of action arising 
under it to Purchaser without Vendor's prior permission."

Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.

Pursuant to your request, we have reviewed the project documents in
connection with possible sale of Midway Development Company in order to
determine whether, if the transaction were structured as a sale of assets,
consent would be required to assign any agreements or permits of Midway to
the purchaser.  The results of our review are summarized in the attached
chart.  As you will note, there should not be a problem assigning any of the
agreements or permits in connection with the contemplated sale, but certain
forms and applications under applicable statutes and regulations would be
required to be submitted in order to obtain consent from the relevant
governmental authorities to assign the permits.  However, various agency
representatives we spoke with indicated that it would be highly unusual to
deny permission to transfer.

Please give this term sheet a look and advise of any changes you think might be necessary.  For instance, it gives the delivery point as the CPL/Cogentrix border, and not the bb of the facility as Kayne suggested.  I am drafting off of the term sheet, so your input is very important.

I need the name of the generation facility and approximate number of megawatts we will be marketing for them.  Also, are we still planning on dealing with some PPA's they have?  If so, what will our involvement be and how many more megawatts are involved?

Are we only going to pay Cogentrix after we have received payment from the third party?  If they fail to remit other costs (transmission, for instance), I presume we will want to deduct that from what we owe them.  What other costs might we need to be reimbursed for?  What are Resource Costs?

How often will we email or fax them a sales summary? Will we be reporting to whom each delivery of power was sold?

Kortney, please confirm that Credit will not be requiring any particular language, etc in this deal since we aren't using an EEI.

Thanks for your help,

Kay



 "
2062,"john - thanx for your time on phone this afternoon.

a) just received cc of letter from westinghouse.  in it, they assert that:

""title to the existing generator passed to enron upon delivery into the 
united states.  delivery occurred at houston on or about 23jul00.  as 
required by the contract and incoterms 1990, risk of loss to the generator 
passed to enron when the generator arrived (ddp) at houston while the 
generator remained on board the common carrier.  the generator was delivered 
in an undamaged condition.  title and risk of loss passed to enron before the 
water damage to the generator occurred.""

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

b) per the contract between enron and westinghouse:

section 15.1.2 title to Equipment - Title to the Equipment will pass to 
Purchaser immediately upon entry into the united states.
section 15.2 risk of loss - Seller shall bear the risk of loss and damage 
with respect to the Equipment until delivery of the Equipment to the Delivery 
Point in accordance with Section 3.2.1.  Seller shall be required to inspect 
the Equipment for damage at the Delivery Point.
section 3.2.1 - Seller shall cause the Equipment to be delivered to the 
Delivery Point on a DDP basis in accordance with Sections 10.2.1 by the date 
set forth therein.
section 3.2.2 - Seller shall be responsible for delivering the CT-Unit DDP to 
the: (iii) u.s. port of export by any means of transport.
section 3.2.3 - Seller shall perform customs clearance for the Equipment 
through u.s. customs and pay any import duties.
section 10.2.1 Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date - Seller will cause the CT-Unit 
(author's note - includes the generator) to be delivered in an undamaged 
condition in accordance with the Specification-CT to the Delivery Point (DDP) 
in accordance with Schedule I below (the Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date).  
(author's note - the date specified in the contract was later slipped per 
agreement with enron).
section 10.2.3 Completion of Delivery - delivery of the CT-Unit to the 
Delivery Point shall be considered complete for the purposes of Delivery 
Liquidated Damages as it pertains to the delivery of Major Components 
(author's note - includes the GT and generator) when the last Major Component 
of such CT-Unit is delivered DDP to the Delivery Point in complete and 
undamaged condition.  ...  Purchaser shall have the right to inspect the 
Equipment for condition of the Equipment upon actual delivery.  Purchaser 
reserves the right to reject damaged Equipment at any location; however, in 
the event a portion of the Equipment is damaged or defective upon delivery to 
the Delivery Point, Purchaser after making an initial assessment of the 
damage or defect and consulting with Seller as to how such damage will affect 
the installation , operation, performance, reliability, efficiency, and 
warranty of the damaged Equipment may either:
(i) reasonable determine that such damage or defect is such that the 
preceding criteria is so adversely affected that Purchaser cannot accept 
delivery of the damaged Equipment and declare that delivery has not occurred, 
or
(ii) after taking into account such criteria and Seller's proposed plan for 
correcting such damage or defect in accordance with Section 9.5, declare that 
delivery has occurred: in the event Purchaser discovers such a damage or 
defect, it shall notify Seller of such as soon as practical.

c) facts of the case, as we know them:

common carrier ship carrying the generator supposedly arrived in port of 
houston approx. 14jul00.  i.e., that was the ship's estimated time of arrival 
(eta).
westinghouse is claiming that delivery occurred on or about 23jul00.
enron representative (frank cervenka) went to CTSS (i.e., the westinghouse 
facility here in houston) on friday, 21jul00 to inspect the combustion 
turbine.  during that inspection, westinghouse employees informed him that 
the generator had salt water damage at the port.  as a result, the following 
monday, 24jul00, he visited the port of houston with the siemens-westinghouse 
insurance adjustor and saw the damaged generator.  note - this was just a 
cursory visit to verify that in fact the unit had been damaged.  the full 
extent of the damage and impact on the project was not known at that time - 
e.g., repair or replace were still viable options.
enron received formal notification (faxed letter) of the damaged generator on 
approx. 18aug00.
enron has already made progress payments to siemens-westinghouse in the 
amount of 95% of the contract value of the gas turbine and generator.
DDP, per incoterms 1990, means delivered duty paid.
Westinghouse, despite 2 prior requests from enron, has not provided copies of 
the customs clearance documentation.  i.e., we don't know the exact date that 
the generator cleared customs, or if it cleared customs.
title means ownership, but does not imply either risk of loss or care, 
custody, and control.  with title comes both ownership and the responsibility 
for payment of taxes.

d) info not known by enron:

when did ship come into port?
when did damage to generator occur?
when, or if, u.s. customs duties were paid?

f) info known by enron:

generator is a total loss, as determined by westinghouse.
per section 10.2.3 of contract, enron was not given the formal opportunity to 
inspect the damaged generator until a month after it arrived in port.  as 
recalled by matt tezyk, westinghouse was then advised by enron in writing 
that the generator was rejected and that delivery had not occurred.  
(author's note - matt to find cc of that letter).

g) enron's assertions are that:

DDP was not satisfied.  i.e., delivery of the generator did not occur in 
accordance with the terms of the contract.
title (i.e., ownership) remains with siemens-westinghouse.
risk of loss remains with siemens-westinghouse.

john - plz assess the copy of the contract provided to you this afternoon 
under separate cover.  we request a legal opinion as to whether delivery, in 
accordance with the contract, of the CT-Unit occurred or not.  plz call with 
any questions.  regards.  scott."
2063,"Thanks for sending me the 2000 Incoterms.  Our library was finally able to 
locate our copy of the 1990 Incoterms and I have reviewed them.

To answer your question, I don't think the Incoterms will have much of an 
effect on our analysis except with respect to the definition of DDP (delivery 
duty paid).  Section 1.14 of the Contract states that DDP shall have the 
meaning as defined in Incoterms 1990 (except as the parties otherwise 
specifically provide herein).  As best I can tell, Section 1.14 is the only 
provision of the Contract that mentions the Incoterms.

The introduction of the Incoterms (paragraph 22) states that ""merchants 
wishing to use these rules should now specify that their contracts will be 
governed by Incoterms 1990""   At a minimum, this suggests that the Incoterms 
are not automatically incorporated into a given contract.  Rather, the 
parties should specify in their contracts whether the Incoterms will apply.  
In this case, the only reference I can find to Incoterms in the Contract 
(unless I am missing something) is Section 1.14 which simply incorporates the 
definition of DDP.

Additionally, I believe that the Incoterms DDP provision is good for Enron.  
Under the 1990 Incoterms, DDP ""means that the seller fulfills his obligation 
to deliver when the goods have been made available at the named place in the 
country of importation.  The seller has to bear the risks and costs, 
including duties, taxes and other charges of delivering the goods thereto, 
cleared for importation.  While the EXW term represents the minimum 
obligation for the seller, DDP represents the maximum obligation.  The 
Incoterms go on to say that the seller has to place the goods at the disposal 
of the buyer at the agreed point at the named pace of destination.  The 
seller must bear all risks of loss of or damage to goods until such time as 
they have been delivered (i.e., the goods have been placed at the disposal of 
buyer).

Westinghouse will have to argue that the CT-Unit was placed at the disposal 
of Enron.  This will be difficult since they informed us of the damage before 
we ever looked at the CT-Unit.  Further, Westinghouse's argument sounds more 
like they rely on Incoterm DES rather then DDP.  Incoterm DES (Delivered Ex 
Ship) means that the seller fulfills his obligation to deliver when the goods 
have been made available to the buyer on board the ship uncleared for import 
at the named port of destination.  I have not seen any reference in the 
contract to Incoterm DES yet that is what it sounds like Westinghouse is 
arguing.

In short, I think our contract argument as reflected in the memo provides a 
sound basis for our contentions and the Incoterms should not be factored in 
other than as referenced in the contract itself.

If you would like a more detailed analysis of this issue in memo form please 
let me know.

Please send the forms to Carlos also since for 2, 3, and 4 we will use the

since Blue Dog is paying for some of the development of the letter agreement 
and the llc forms.

It sure sounds like we won't be tendering a facility agreement, but until the

Once the LLC is formed you will get the complete corporate books which will

have you had a chance to review the draft I sent you, and do you have any 
notions about how to structure this deal?  Is the format ok?  Can we  make it

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch Neg

Fitch-NY-October 26, 2001: Fitch has placed the ratings of
Marlin Water Trust II's (Marlin II's) approximately $915 million
senior secured notes due 2003, and Osprey Trust's (Osprey's)
approximately $2.4 billion senior secured notes due 2003 on
Rating Watch Negative. The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes
are currently rated `BBB'. This rating action follows the
placing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by
Fitch.

The rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund
account (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron
in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The
overfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated
'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to service
interest to noteholders. Payment of principal ultimately relies
on Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible
preferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred
securities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative. In addition, the
transaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loan
to Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch.

Similarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the
support from the assets in the share trust used to support
interest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to
remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund
principal payments. The mandatorily convertible preferred stock
has been issued and is being held in the share trust. The assets
in the share trust supporting interest payments include Enron
unsecured obligations (the overfund account) as well as
quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible
preferred stock.

While various sources of repayment exist, such as sale or
liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering, in
each case primary credit support is derived from the Enron
obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock
if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been
deposited with the trustee the 120-day prior to the maturity
date, which is one of the Note Trigger Events. In the event that
the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount
required to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to
deliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver
on this obligation, subject to certain standstill periods, then
the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of
Enron, representing a general unsecured claim. Additional Note
Trigger Events include a downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured
debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies
in conjunction with specified declines in Enron's closing stock
price over three consecutive trading days, as well as customary
events of default under the notes. It is important to note that
Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

Fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction
with the ratings of Enron, Corp. and will update investors as
appropriate.


Enron's Debt Falls As Company Draws Down On Bank Loans

10/26/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early Friday following the Houston energy giant's decision Thursday to draw down about $3 billion on its bank loan facilities. 
Late Thursday, Enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community. Specifically, the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $1 billion.
Enron's 6.4% bonds which come due in July 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar, down from around 82 cents on Thursday. 
Trading activity in investment-grade bank debt like that of Enron's isn't as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment-grade ratings. But fixed-income sources noted some offers Friday for Enron's bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar, still well-above distressed levels. They add that banks may want to try to sell Enron's bank debt, which is now funded following the drawdown, but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago. 
That was well before Enron ran into its current market turmoil. Last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The company has said that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with Andrew S. Fastow, its former chief financial officer who was replaced on Wednesday. 
Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's senior unsecured debt at Baa1, though it's on review for a possible downgrade. Fitch Inc. and Standard & Poor's both rate the debt triple-B-plus. Fitch also has Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, while S&P changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. 
Enron's stock was trading at around $15.87, down 48 cents at around 12.20 p.m. EDT. 
Among the Enron bank debt that comes due in May 2002 is a $1.75 billion 364-day commercial paper backstop facility. The company also has a $1.25 billion revolving facility that's due in April 2005, according to Loan Pricing Corp. in New York. 
One distressed debt investor said some of the bank debt comes with a low coupon of around 55 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate. 
Banks, the investor said, ""are funding it and not getting paid for the risk at Libor plus 55, even though it comes due in May '02,"" the investor said. 
Another fixed-income official said that trading desks may start to kick the tires on Enron's bank debt, given the run of fallen angels, or investment-grade companies that have been downgraded to below investment-grade status, within the last year. Among such companies are Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) and Xerox Corp. (XRX) 
""As soon as banks have a piece of paper they never expected to be funded, it really changes their perception and some just want to get this stuff off their books,"" this person said. 
Some banks, though, may not be active seller of Enron's debt given that banks' business with big investment-grade companies is relationship-driven. 
""Banks are not very quick to pull out of a relationship like that,"" the fixed income official said.

I just read an article on the Blomberg news service that says that there are now six bidders and it is expected to go on into the night.  Each bidder is in a separate conference rooms and the lawyers are going from room to room to get the latest bid and provide updates as to what the best bid amount and structure is.  Sounds wild.

Dec. 28
Beginning at 5:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will remove domain controllers CORPHOU-DCARD02 and CORPHOU-DCARD03 from service to be rebuilt.  These are just two of the numerous active domain controllers within the Corp domain.  There should be no disruption of service as user requests should automatically be redirected to an active domain controller.  Once these servers are rebuilt, they will be returned to the Corp domain.

Dec. 31
From 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will move ECTHOU-HR1 to the Ardmore data center.  This move will result in a total disruption of service for those HR users whose S:\ drive is mapped to this server.

Jan. 7
From 7:00 a.m. through 1/11 at 5:00 p.m., Facilities will perform the annual maintenance on the rooftop chillers.  The chillers will be taken down one at a time during the maintenance.  No impact to ETS is expected.

2103,"Hello Danny-

I wanted to contact you as I am finishing the recruiting process out of
Columbia.  As you know, I am very interested in returning to Enron after
graduation (this May) and am in the process of getting back up to speed
on the different business units. Therefore, I am planning on making a
visit to Houston in November (tentatively 7th-9th).

I would be very interested in gaining your insight on which areas might
be a good fit and would appreciate any time you may have to discuss.
Please let me know if you would be available to meet with me sometime
during these days.  Thanks.

Best regards,

Here's a quick summary of the bullets I discussed with Dennis.  He was not happy about the last one, in particular.

Liability issues are overwhelming - - - GP role is just not feasible until residual claims go away.
We are prepared to exchange our residual claims for AFUDC + interest accruals for the right to become a 9.4% GP at some later date, say commencement of construction or time of certificate.
We want the partnership to make an all out effort to recover historic capital contributions either in rates or as an amortizable asset; likewise, we recognize that AFUDC and interest accruals are sunk.
If we don't rejoin as a GP, we will walk away from AFUDC and interest accruals but want to be reimbursed historic capital contribution.
Not comfortable with making any collective response to Sen. Murkowski.  We will make our own."

2115,"Christine,

I so rarely write love notes.  17 years ago it was common place, even a daily 
event.  What happened to that guy?  I could have been a cartoonist in another 
life.  

I am here at 35,000 feet 2,000 miles from Bankock Thailand, flying  by China, 
soon to be over the Philippines and pondering our lives.  You said something 
very interesting to me on the phone as I was getting on the bus to the 
airport.  You said that you would love to have 6 hours on the airplane by 
yourself.  I can certainly understand that.  I seem to have a l lot of that 
on this trip.  I am sitting here on the plane, a little tipsy after a couple 
glasses of wine, and my mind turns to you and the kids.   I wish I could be 
there now to see the kids all dressed up in their costumes ready to go out 
trick or treating.  I bet they look great.

As i sit here and feel a little sorry for myself then i come back to reality 
and realize just how lucky we really are.  I turned to Ken Rice at the 
ceremony yesterday and said, ""What is an Okie and a boy from Nebraska doing 
at a Japanese barrel ceremony with Thomas Foley, former Speaker of the House, 
breaking a barrel of saki in front of 300 Japanese executives and TV.  The 
Prime Minister of Japan didn't show up and actually it is expected that he is 
out of a job on a no confidence vote last night.  (Really bad luck for Enron 
here) I would have liked to have met him.  Actually, the ceremony was neat 
and I imagine that they will have some funny pictures from it.  You should 
see me in a Happy coat.  I'll explain when i get home.  

Can you imagine sitting in our home, right after Michael was born and even 
imagining what are lives are like today?  We are so blessed.  Even more than 
that, I am so blessed to have you. I was writing in my journal on the trip 
over, you know my journal - that project that I have dedicated a big part of 
my life to and that you have never read, reflecting on our lives and 
wondering why God let me find you so many years ago.  I must have been a 
priest in a former life.

Anyway, I just wanted to say I love you and there aren't any phones on this 
airplane.  Thai Airlines, go figure. So I am calling you via email.  Although 
I am not sure when I will get the opportunity to actually send this over the 
internet.

I love you and miss you very much.

Eternally,
Michael

See you soon and in time for soccer.

 Thanks for the message and let me be the first to welcome you to the Dabhol

review.   One of us will get back to you to discuss a way forward.  

 That aside, I'm pretty impressed with your ""third party beneficiary""

2117,"Mike, I too am an insulin dependent diabetic for the past 27 years ( since 
age 7 ) and would be very interested in helping with your group.  Not really 
sure what I can accomplish with EGM from my Charleston, WV location but know 
that I am interested.

Kids are my concern as well.  In fact, I am coaching my sons soccer team and 
have a 5 year old diabetic on my team.

Just a thought for you.................I have been on an insulin pump for the 
past 7 years and it has made a tremendous difference for my life.  Certainly 
worth exploring if you are not using one.  Also, my brother ( Bank of America 
employee ) is on the ADA board for the Southeast region if you may wish to 
contact him about speakers ( doctors ).

Having said the above, I pledge $ 250.00 for the cause.

I had an interview with a reporter from the Economist yesterday.  He is doing 
a big story on business changes, online changes, Jeff Skilling and Enron. 
Coal came up a lot and i described my enthusiasm for our coal business and 
our growth.  He wants to put some focus on the coal business and i need some 
facts to get back to him.

What percentage of our coal transactions or business is online?
Speed changes on a typical transaction post and pre online?
Other changes you see or products to develop
International effects
Total coal moved (physical and financial) especially online
Other competing exchanges and why ours is better
Other proEnron facts that illustrate our growing business especially as it 
relates to paradigm changes or online changes

Please feed me this info and if there is something specific that you don't 
want me to say let me know that too but go ahead and give me the answer.  I 
need this information pretty quickly.

Thanks for your voicemail and email.  Your resume is impressive and I have 2 
thoughts.  Most of our efforts in EGM are not asset related but I would

construction projects and Rick Bergseiker, Middle East and also co-heads LNG.

Thanks and good luck.

2127,"Darrell,

I attempted to call you a few minutes ago (late night your time - but there 
was no voicemail).  I didn't want to wait several more days before I contact 
you.  I'm out all weekend.

Eric shared with me some of your concerns about resources for a Korea LNG 
opportunity.  I certainly understand your view but wanted to share some of my 
thoughts.  Rick and/or Clay know the Asian LNG industry better than anyone 
else in the company.  They are very good and I have a lot of faith in them 
and their ability to assess opportunities and develop projects.  They are 
lacking wholesale type of transaction experience that a few of the guys that 
have recently come into the group have.  That is why we have brought them 
in.   We have a very strong team and i like the mix a lot.  

Eric is the person we chose to run the group for many reasons but it wasn't' 
done as a lack of faith in Rick or his original team.  The biggest 
opportunities and the viewpoint we must take in this business is running it 
like a wholesale unit and running it as a portfolio of transactions and 
books.  That certainly doesn't  mean that 20 years of experience doesn't have 
enormous value especially in the non-Atlantic markets.  Rick is in the 
process of coming back to Houston after the shut down of our middle east 
projects and strategy.  Rick is also in the process of assessing what exactly 
he would like to do in the time of transition.  My very sincere hope is that 
he will stay in the LNG group and perform a very important role especially in 
this type of development or deal making role.  Especially  in a big deal in 
Japan, Korea or something in the Asian area.  We will discuss this next week 
when he comes to town.  

I need Eric to be in Houston right now due to our Elba Island, Venezuela and 
Bahamas immediate activity.  He will certainly be engaged in everything but 
he can not be focuses as much as you need in Korea or Joe needs in Japan.

Please give me a call next week and we can discuss this in more detail.

Thanks,
mike


PS - Frevert also likes this role for Rick.  Also the Eric specific head role 
has not been officially announced yet.

2134,"Team, 

Another great meeting this month!  Thanks for your participation.

Please mark your calendar for our next Vision and Values meeting - Wednesday, 
August 16 from 9am until noon in eb 46c1.

Below summarizes the key points from our July 19 meeting:

Communications Training
Feedback from I&I continues to be positive.
The number of vp's and above not enrolled in Executive Impact and Influence 
increased to 111.  The increase is the result of cancellations.  
We had a discussion about what the ""quantifiable penalty"" would be for vp's 
and above who DID NOT participate in the Executive Impact and Influence 
training.  I continue to research this issue.  I hope to have an update at 
our next meeting on August 16.
Work continues on the development on Executive Impact and Influence II.  The 
design of this one-day training session is slated to be completed by the end 
of August.  The plan is to conduct the first training session by the end of 
September.  P&D training will be included in the course curriculum. 
Development of the on-line communications course continues working with 
Cognitive Arts with a target completion of year end.  V&V Task Force members 
will receive a call from Cognitive Arts to provide input into the design of 
the course. 

Communication Tools
The updated PeopleFinder and ExpertFinder are on schedule.  PeopleFinder 
should be available at the end of July and ExpertFinder should be available 
by mid-September.

P&D 
Work continues to roll P&D out in the new Enron tool, ThinkBank.  Initial map 
sites for drop down content on the P&D flowchart are being developed.
Facilitators are currently being identified throughout the organization.
We need all V&V Task Force members to communicate with their business units 
about using this tool when appropriate.

Communication Campaign
Additional products continue to be distributed throughout the Houston Enron 
building with interesting Enron facts.  
Targeted international offices received their Vision and Values posters.

Diversity
Dick Liebert reported that questions for the ETC survey are currently being 
developed.
Three additional Diversity Focus Groups are being held to include the 
perspective of commercial employees.
A meeting of the entire Diversity Task Force is scheduled for Sept. 26.

Best Companies Survey
Mary Clark and team completed Enron's application and forwarded it to Fortune 
on July 25.  Keep your fingers crossed!

That covers the high points of the meeting.  Please let me know if you have 
additional information to share with the group.  Beth and I will see you 
August 16.

Attached for your information and input is a copy of a presentation I am 
putting together for EGM.  I would appreciate your comments on the 
presentation but especially need your input on your section.  The LNG page is 
on page 6 and needs some work.  there is also a typo.  On the graph, we need 
to find a way to illustrate our business graphically, what do you think?
 I would appreciate a quick turnaround of your initial changes.  After we 
complete this first draft, this will be a continuous work in progress.
Thanks,
Mike

Steve Horn is pushing for us to speak at this conference in Aspen.  I told 
him that I am not available but it does look good and it is in a nice place - 
also the speakers are first rate.  What do you think?  If you are interested 
please let Steve know.  I told him that I thought everyone was busy.

2140," As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

2167,"Errol,

I am still interested in selling the car; I have a couple driving in from
Austin next weekend who are really serious about buying the car. I started a
new business (see below) and need a 4 door car.

The specifications:

1998 Porsche Boxster, Metallic Blue, Black top with black interior, 23,400
miles, $37,500, 17"" wheels, CD player, cruise control, heated mirrors, power
seats, automatic climate control, factory alarm, 5-speed, power top, power
windows, remote trunk release, gold Porsche badges (on wheels as well).

Performance:  0-60 mph 6.4 seconds / 150 mph top speed / 201 hp 2.5 liter
flat six engine

Errol - if you are interested let me know ASAP; Jennifer (Austin couple) is
pretty serious about the purchase. I also have a 1995 Triumph Speed Triple
with 8,200 miles (bought new in 8/96) that I am looking to sell for $4,800.
Comes with lots of accessories.

The story:

I bought the car in 10/99 with 5,300 from West Side Infiniti (Houston). An
older gentleman traded in the car for a Q45 (he had the Porsche for a year;
had a hard time getting in and out of the car). The record (call Momentum
Porsche in Houston - all record on file) show that the car had an oil change
at 2,000 miles, 4,200 miles, 14,000 miles (15,000 mile check up). The car
currently has 23,400 miles on it. I have had no problems with the car and is
in perfect running condition.

The original Pirelli P-Zero's lasted me until 21,555 (quite a feat
considering that they run out at 14,000 - 18,000 miles). I replaced the
tires with Pirelli P7000 Super Sports (better 4 season tire and longer tread
life without sacrificing handling). I also had the shop align the car to
factory settings.

The car has been garaged all of the time. I used to work in downtown and
live in downtown so the car barely was driven during the weekdays. The car
is driven more on a daily basis. I used to own a BMW Z3 so taking care of
German cabriolets is comes second hand. The car has never been in a wreck
and is in perfect condition in every aspect. The interior color is black and
again in perfect condition. Please let me if you are interested and I will
be more than happy to let you test drive the car or take it to your mechanic
for an inspection (or arrange a screening with one of the Porsche dealers to
inspect the car).

Please feel free to contact me at either numbers below.

Bids Open for Enron Trading Unit
By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer 
HOUSTON (AP) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge has set in motion the bidding process for embattled Enron Corp.'s once-dominant trading operation, which some Wall Streets insiders say could fetch up to $1 billion. 
Enron said at a hearing Wednesday before Judge Arthur Gonzalez in New York that it would allow parties to bid for all or part of the wholesale trading unit. 
Enron lawyer Martin J. Bienenstock said none of the 14 potential bidders to come forward so far have expressed interest in bidding for Enron's book of contracts, which Enron values at $5 billion to $7 billion. 
Bids are due Jan. 7; an auction will be held Jan. 10. 
Bienenstock said bidders are wary of the potential liabilities in the contracts and that the short time frame does not allow for a full review of the books. The company, however, wants to complete the auction as soon as possible to avoid losing traders to other financial companies. 
In Enron's home base of Houston Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that a state court should decide whether Enron must give rival Dynegy Inc. a key natural gas pipeline. 
Dynegy claims Enron signed away its right to Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline, a prized 16,500-mile system running between Texas and the Midwest, in exchange for $1.5 billion invested in Enron before a proposed merger of the two competitors collapsed in late November. 
Enron claims its smaller rival illegally terminated the $8.4 billion deal and therefore has no right to the pipeline. Enron and had argued that Dynegy's claim should be part of Enron's massive bankruptcy case filed in federal court in New York. 
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon ruled that Dynegy's suit should be heard in state court because the company's claim was not a core element of the bankruptcy. Harmon noted that Dynegy could have sued Enron if the former energy giant didn't seek Chapter 11 protection. 
``It's what we predicted,'' said David Burns, a lawyer representing Dynegy in the lawsuit. ``If we don't have Northern Natural Gas turned over to us promptly, we will ask the court to provide an accelerated trial date on this.'' 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined comment on the decision. 
Dynegy sued Enron in Texas state court in Houston the day after Enron filed one of the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcies in U.S. history Dec. 2 and sued Dynegy for $10 billion for breach of contract in New York. 
Dynegy and other creditors also have asked that the bankruptcy case be moved to Houston, where Enron, Dynegy and many of Enron's 800 or so creditors are based. Gonzalez will consider those requests Jan. 7. 
Also Wednesday, nearly 40 of some 4,500 Enron employees laid off after the company filed for bankruptcy gathered outside Enron headquarters here to discuss the company's severance policy and sign a complaint to Enron on the lack of information. 
Some carried signs that displayed the word ``Moron'' under Enron's logo and said ``What were they thinking?'' Others wore T-shirts that said ``The Execs Who Stole Christmas.'' 
Gonzalez on Dec. 4 $1.5 billion in short-term financing to keep the company afloat and fund $4,500 severance payments. 
Former workers received those checks last week, but revelations that nearly 600 employees deemed critical to Enron's survival received more than $100 million in retention payments upset those entitled to more money under Enron's severance policy, they said. 
The company's severance policy says eligible workers are entitled to a week's pay for each full or partial year of employment and another week's pay for each $10,000 they earned in salary, up to a maximum of 26 weeks. 
``We would like the company to honor its commitment,'' said Pete Chase, 31, who worked for Enron Energy Services for 18 months. 
Denne said the company cannot approve any severance payments above $4,500 for each employee without Gonzalez' approval. Employees can file claims with the judge for more severance pay. Instructions on how to do so are available on Enron's Web site (www.enron.com). 
``The next step for Enron is for its creditors to assess its financial condition and assets,'' Denne said. ``Every employee is absolutely free to file a claim.'' 
Enron, formerly No. 7 on the Fortune 500 with stock trading near $90 a year ago, plummeted into bankruptcy after revelations of hidden debt and overstated earnings in October siphoned investor confidence and prompted traders to flee from what was once the world's largest buyer and seller of natural gas. 
Dynegy abandoned a plan to buy Enron for $8.4 billion when it continued to reveal serious financial problems and Enron's credit was downgraded to junk. 
Dynegy shares rose $3.08 to close at $23.98 on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron shares were down 6 cents to 44 cents, also on the NYSE. "

Ken's Not Coming

Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery were slightly lower across the
Western U.S. on Monday, unquestionably the result of less weather-related
demand.  ""Temperatures are forecast to be normal to slightly above-normal
through the week in most regions, so we're feeling pretty bearish right
 now,"" commented one marketer.  A late-session rally for off peak power was
reported at the Mid-Columbia, but most players believed that one or two
parties must have been caught a little bit short given the mild weather and
abundant supplies.  Heating demand in the WSCC was only expected to average
94 percent of normal through February 11, and the latest six-to-ten-day
forecast was calling for mostly normal temperatures from February 10 through
14.  In other industry news, former Enron CEO Ken Lay told Congress on
Sunday that he would refuse to testify before two committees preparing to
hear his testimony.  As a result, the Senate Commerce Committee cancelled
Monday's hearing at which Mr. Lay was to have been the sole witness.  The
Senate Commerce Committee said it would meet Tuesday morning to subpoena Mr.
Lay.  Senator Byron Dorgan, the North Dakota Democrat who heads the
committee's consumer affairs subcommittee, said, ""We decided that we really
had no choice but to issue a subpoena to require his attendance.""  Mr.
Dorgan said he had been assured by some Republicans on the Commerce
Committee that they would vote in favor of a subpoena.

Tuesday's heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell slightly from levels
seen for Monday as regional temperatures had begun to moderate.  A late-day
rally occurred in the light load arena when some shorts reportedly entered
the market.  ""There wasn't a whole lot of activity for the off peak when the
session began, but later on it just shot up,"" said one Oregon-based utility
trader.  Heating demand in the region was forecast to pick up over the
coming weekend, rising to an average of 121 percent of normal next Sunday
and Monday.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward on Monday,
coming in at 110 kcfs through Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday,
60 kcfs Sunday, and 115 kcfs next Monday.  There were a few goings on in the
generation landscape Monday.  Bridger #1 (520 MW) was back in service, but
Bridger #3 and #4 (520 MW each) were brought down so engineers could perform
some ""boiler unplugging.""  The Wyoming-based units were both expected to
return to service sometime on Thursday.

Amid stagnant gas values and slightly below-normal temperatures, power
prices settled lower in the Golden State on Monday.  ""I think prices will
trend down this week, with the warmer weather,"" commented one California
player.  Heavy load goods at NP15 changed hands between 24 and 24.75$/MWh,
with unconfirmed trades heard as high as 26$/MWh.  Light load pieces were
bought and sold from 19.75 to 21$/MWh.  NP15 Balance-of-February was heard
near 23.25$/MWh.  Of hydroelectric interest, the California DWR listed
snow-water equivalents in the northern section of the state at 111% of
normal.  Spot gas values at the Socal border remained flat to Friday levels,
between 2.13 and 2.18/$mmBtu.  In unit news, gas-fired Alamitos #4 (480 MW)
returned to the grid on Monday, and Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) went down for
planned maintenance on Saturday.  On the weather front, Tuesday forecasts
called for highs to reach 70 degrees in L.A. and 58 to 61 degrees at
mid-state load centers.  Overnight lows were anticipated in the mid-30s to
mid-40s.  The five-day outlook predicted little change through Friday.  The
most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from February 10 to
14.

With Phoenix forecast to see daytime highs in the 70s and overnight lows in
the 50s through the week, day-ahead electricity prices headed lower in the
Southwest on Monday.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from 23 to 24.25$/MWh
an average decline of 1$/MWh from levels reported for Monday.  Mead
commanded a premium to PV, with several players stating that the
higher-priced electricity was bound for the California market.  In unit
news, Coronado #1 (395 MW) was operating at 260 megawatts on Monday, but was
still having trouble ramping all the way to full power.  Meanwhile, Coronado
#2 (385 MW) was scheduled to come down early Tuesday for some planned
maintenance slated to last until February 10.  The latest six-to-ten from
the NWS was calling for above-normal temperatures in eastern New Mexico and
normal temperatures everywhere else from February 10 through 14.

2213,"NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : January 14, 2002
TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions 
While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. 
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. 
Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. 
Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. 
TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. 
The pipeline has told the NEB that ""with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade."" Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that ""unconventional gas"" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in ""tight"" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas ""is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions."" At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. 
In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections, the pipeline says only that ""if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations, these sources may start contributing supply this decade."" 
In a separate toll case before the NEB, TransCanada predicts it will be 2008 before northern gas -- from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska -- begins to flow south. An announcement Jan. 14 by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp. suggested that TransCanada's educated guesswork is on the money. After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities, the group -- Imperial Oil, Conoco Canada, Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada -- declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage. Next comes the ""project definition phase,"" or $200-$250 million in technical, environmental, commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field, gas-gathering and pipeline facilities. 
Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in 2003. The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu, Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send 1.2-1.5 Bcf/d south to northwestern Alberta. The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanada's system. 
TransCanada is in step with the group's expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond 2003 to collect approvals and build the project. The pipeline company's forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually, going from a starting rate at 500 MMcf/d in 2008 to 900 MMcf/d in '09, 1.1 Bcf/d in 2010, 1.2 Bcf/d in 2011 and 1.4 Bcf/d by 2012. The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow, however. 
As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the 1970s for production from Prudhoe Bay. In the documents before the NEB, TransCanada says it ""recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics, timing, routing and scope. It's unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas."" "

**********************************
Last time, I said that the trend was still down and I continue to call for the recent lows to be taken out. So far, so good. Yesterday, I also pointed out the potential for both weakness and a potential reversal if we got that weakness early in the week. We got it, so now I have to look for a bounce. Things really didn't get THAT overdone, however, so IF the market rallies, I'll be inclined to short it.
One thing that makes me look for a possible rally is the ARMS (aka the TRIN). This indicator measures not only how many issues are trading down, but how much volume is being sold vs. bought. This indicator can tell us a lot about the flow of money. In this instance it also tells us that there has been excessive selling today. The ARMS Index went out at 2.53 today, and I've learned from experience to expect at least a one day bounce when that happens. The VIX, as I'm sure others have noted, is also relatively high. This too supports a short term rally. Thereafter, however, we have to continue to respect the trend. It's down. Period. The VIX is NOT at excessive levels, so any rally has to be viewed as a place to sell.
There is plenty of room to fall. I would avoid all longer-term long positions until AT LEAST the 1060 area. The earnings fiascoes are creating a crisis of confidence. This won't go away easily. Mutual funds don't have that much cash on hand, either, and if redemptions begin to rise, they could be in deep trouble. So could this market. Don't get too bearish, but be alert for the worse case scenario to develop over the coming weeks. I'm not predicting it, but forewarned is forearmed.
We have to love our shorts, at this juncture.

package.  TBI mentioned that mark-ups to the PSA and the gathering agreement
for TBI reserves (you should also have a copy of it from Audrey) would be
considered heavily in the bid evaluation process. Therefore, I would like to
keep the changes to those required and not ""cosmetic"" or ""druthers"".  We
will need to review both contracts.  I will try to get the TBI gas gathering
agreement as an electronic file today.

at all is pretty good for a guy.  I had a great b-day with Will and
then later his family took me out.  I love being the only girl in

you.  Downing Street is one of my favorite low-key spots - a bit of a meat

I found out that the provision that everyone keeps calling a ROFR is actually a shotgun bidding process.  I am interested in reading the relevant provisions of the document relating to this.  Apparently, if either party wants to sell, it must give purchase price to the other partner and then that other partner has the option to either buy or sell its interest at that price.  This provision may be unenforceable under bankruptcy law if the partner is a debtor.  Please have your assistant provide me with a copy of the partnership agreement ASAP.  Thanks very much.

The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information."

2265,"Gerald:

    I have been contacted by Kim Torres of the Assumption Parish Police
Jury.  She has some questions and concerns about the Purchase & Sale
Agreement, to wit:

1).  They want to add warranty language to ? 4 as follows:

    Seller warrants that it is the record title owner to the property
being sold, and warrants it has good and merchantable title, free of any
and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
buyer for the same.

    Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that
persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding
authority to do so.

I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor
revisions which I will do.

2).  They are concerned about the warranty language which covers
hazardous wastes in ? 4.  They tell me that they have not done an
environmental inspection of the property.  They want to know if there
have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on
the property.  They are looking for something in writing that no such
sources existed.

3).  Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31,
1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to
Louisiana Resources Co., Inc.  Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc.  I
have not done a title exam so I cannot explain this discrepancy.

4).  She gave me the physical address of the property and the name of
the Police Jury President which I will insert in the documents.

Please contact me to discuss our response to these concerns.

Leslie, I am not sure of who is handling this from the accounting side and who is the commercial expert on the ""cash out protocol, but by copying this letter to Jim, I am requesting that he determine who is the commercial point person. Gerald and I can work together to determine whether the legal provisions of the cash out agreements are adequate as between third parties and Enron......concerns  have also been expressed by Brian Redmond about whether AEP will only try to settle those cash out situations where Enron is the obligor as opposed to both sides of the equation. I request that Jim set up a meeting with the appropriate persons and distribute the cash out protocol for discussion of the ""larger picture on cash out management"".

2310,"Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, ""Where is this relationship headed?""  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.

I pay her $50 every time she comes, which is every two weeks.  She does it all.  Mops, vacuums, dusts, washes dishes, cleans bathrooms and kitchen, she also washes my clothes, bed sheets, and towels.   They do speak very little English.  Her husband speaks better, but they may have you speak with their son, unless you want to use your Spanish and pretend you are back in Madrid.  Use my name.  If she has availability, her and her husband will come out to the house and take a look.  You can go over with her what you want done and then agree on the price.  I give her a key to my house and she comes when I am not there. A lot of people I know use her and she is trustworthy.  Feel free to ask if you have questions.

"
2336,"
As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal."
2337,"Hey, man, I called YOU on that after pulling-up the chart and finding
options on the DIA.  I can say this since I'm in the money.  Had I been
losing money right now, it would have been YOUR fault, of course.

The great thing on the options is that this volatility has been great for
me!

"
2338,"I have called a few people and found that the estate team will be supporting you.  I forwarded your phone number and let them know to get this done ASAP.  You should get a call soon.


Good luck,
Daniel

 "
2339,"We will continue to offer REORIENTATION sessions to keep you updated on changes to Enron's business policies and procedures since filing for bankruptcy.

2343,"Trying to determine what to slate for the weekend.  What do you think about fishing prospects?  Sat. morning?

2411,"The New England Conference of Public Utilities Commissioners (NECUPUC) filed 
an Answer if Support of the Motion of the Maine Public Utilities Commission 
for Disclosure of Information.
NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of 
ISO-NE's September 21, 2000 Answer in this case.  In the alternative, they 
would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to 
the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer 
subject to an appropriate protective order.



Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC 
request for public information.

DENA argues that only a  three month lag in the release of confidential 
information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services 
Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information.
Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL 
markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit.
If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it 
should be subject to a protective order which contains the following:
The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket.
Only specifically named ""reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review 
the information.
The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises.
The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate.


Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast 
Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited 
commission action.  NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for 
disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the 
selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory 
commissions and not other participants.   NUSCO and Select Energy request 
expedited action due the financial implications and there is also 
considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in 
January, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending 
Commission guidance.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

I think all of us, including myself, underutilize this tool.  I want to encourage everybody to keep the board open on their computers all day long.  In addition, I want everybody to post at least one message every day.  This can be an interesting trade that just happened, what counterparties are trying to do, new information you uncovered, etc.  Information we learn can be very valuable to other desks and it is only fair that if we're taking info from the board, we should be contributing as well."

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

2430,"Do you prefer that I take out the added language for future agreements?

 "
2431,"For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.

Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.   

I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.

Hey Cooper, 
What a great idea! Eze sounds much better than Emily.  I hope it's not to late to change my business cards.  ""Eze the auditor"" has a nice ring to it. 
Sounds like moving was a good time.  The worst part about moving is having to deal with the stuff still in boxes that you haven't unpacked from your previous move.  Most people throw it away,  but not me.  I, for some reason,  feel like I might need it someday,  yet I have no idea what I have in these mystery boxes.  I'm sure your movers loved the obstacle course to get to your place.  They probably thought it was some kind of joke.  Thanks for the moving stories,  they were entertaining.  I have a visual of your building manager...pure comedy!  So when are you guys having the big house warming/  hot tub party?  It would be a good chance to cash in on some more scooby doo paraphenelia and house warming gifts.  Speaking of Scooby doo,  I'm sure Jai is loving the scooby phone.  I can see him not answering it until after a couple rings just so he can get the whole show. 
How is the whole work out regime coming along??  It sounds like you have a balance in your life.  Work is going well,  because you get to trade again, and your working out.  How does it feel?  I am all about balance in life.  Although it might not seem like it from the little free time I have,  I have a balance. I'm going for runs at all hours of the late night/ early morning....just to keep things intersting!
I'm going to look into wine fest,  and I'll let you know.  Jill and I are trying to get some people together to paint pottery in the evening next week.  We thought it would be a good alternative to going for drinks.  That way we can grab coffee (preferably, from Starbucks) and chill while we creat masterpieces. Anyone who wants to come is welcome.  Doesn't that sound like fun?  I'm already looking foward to it!  I was thinking Tuesday?  You and Jai could make something for your new place!
I leave you with that.....and before I forget,  guess who's buying baby blue pants from banana this week?  We'll be super fly cool cats!!!
eze 
PS - where's my clip art you promised??  Jill isn't at work this week,  so I'm not getting any interesting e-mails from her.

Everything was fine with the file.  From now on could you please divide it 
into three separate files?  I've attached the files that I loaded for the 
17th, so if you just keep the same name (just update the date everyday) that 
would help me a lot.   As for the master deal id, as long as they are all 
unique what you had was fine.

If you have any more questions just give me a call.

2483," The meeting Don and I had with Kinder/Morgan to discuss his Price Risk 
Management Product went really well.  We met with Park Schaper (CFO), Anthony 
Lannie (President of Power Group) and Jay Hopper (VP and General Manager) was 
on the phone from Denver.  They were very interested with regards to 
potentially replacing long term tolling agreements with this product.  Enron 
could provide a five year toll and the product would begin in the sixth year 
through year 15 or 20.  
 We talked very little about their existing projects; Little Rock and 
Michigan.  They do have all the permits for the Little Rock site and are 
moving forward with the Michigan site and still do not have any tolling 
agreements in place for those projects. 
 The ball is currently in their court and were going to get back with Scot 
with respects to the projects and with Tom on the PRM Product.  Please let me 
know if you have any questions with this matter.  Thanks!

 I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA 
Program.  In the end, the results were not favorable.  I understand that it 
is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, 
recommendations, extracurricular activities, etc., that this would help my 
chances and possibly compensate for my disability.  After talking with you 
and Professors Titman, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right 
place to continue learning about energy-finance.  
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do 
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three 
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and 
Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this 
level. I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, 
this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the 
Admissions commitee that I can excel with the work at The Texas University 
Graduate School of Business.  
 Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.  It has been a 
pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and 
finance in the future.  Also, if you can think of anything else I can do to 
strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.  
Take care and hope to hear from you soon.

I am not sure that Swati from Duke understands what the payment schedule 
represents.  First of all, the property tax payments for assessment years 
2000 - 2009 range from a high of $590K to $490K and are not close to the 
numbers he feels are reflected by the schedule. 

 Property tax payments for any given assessment year in Mississippi are paid 
in January of the year following the year of assessment.  For example, the 
property taxes for the 2000 year assessment year are paid in January 2001 and 
the payment schedule reflects that ($591,200).  The other figure that shows 
in the column are property taxes for that year to be paid in the following 
year.

The 15% ratio of assessment has been taken into account in the calculation 
and the payments for the year are total estimated taxes for the year 
including the payment-in-lieu-of taxes payment (""PILOT"").

The document for the PILOT agreement has been supplied to the Duke Property 
Tax Department.  Have Swati contact Kelly Voelkel for any information he 
needs.

If additional information is necessary please contact me at X-30689.

2505,"Greetings, Mr. Rogers

We are now in possession of your TEXASMBA admission application.  Though it
has not yet completed the formal review process, you are correct in your
assessment that your GMAT score may prove to be a tremendous negative in
your overall competitive profile.

Before I conclude our final review, I would ask that you further clarify to
me the nature of the learning disability you mention in your fourth essay.
I am especially interested in how this disability directly affects your
performance in a timed, test situation, as well as the traditional classroom
setting.

Also, you mention in your essay that you have ""... overcome this disability
...""   I would ask that you cite for me the specific steps you have taken to
accomplish this feat, and by what measures you may make this claim.

Finally, I would ask that you summarize for me the reasons why you feel your
level of academic performance at Catholic University of America will not be
replicated in the graduate business classroom here at The TEXAS Graduate
School of Business.

As you consider your responses to these questions, I am placing your
application on ""hold"".  No final decision will be made until you are
satisfied that you have provide whatever additional information you feel
appropriate and merited.

I look forward to hearing from you, and thank you for your interest in The
TEXAS Graduate School of Business.

Blotter has a selection that needs to be checked in order to display EOL deals.
The system shows that you don't have that check box checked.
If that's the problem than all that you need to do is to check that box:

1. In Blotter use the ""Clear"" button to clear any deals that may already show.
2. Go to ""Defaults"" on the menu.
3. Select the only option there (""Startup/New Deals Defaults..."")
4. Make sure you have ""Show EOL Deals"" checked.

 

If this is not the issue, please give me a call at 5-7265.

2514,"The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently in an Enron contract garage you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until fall 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.

My Dad has the tickets and is going to keep them with him.  He doesn't want

2571,"Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Competition Bureau Raided Enron, Powerex Offices, Paper Says
11/23/0 9:44 (New York)


     Toronto, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's Competition Bureau
raided offices at Powerex Corp. and the Canadian arm of Enron
Corp., alleging the companies conspired to raise electricity
prices, the Globe and Mail reported, citing officials from both
companies.
     The bureau obtained a search warrant in May, claiming the two
companies co-ordinated bids last year to drive up prices on
Alberta's central electricity exchange, the paper said. Both
Powerex and Enron Canada Corp. said charges haven't been laid, and
denied they had broken any laws.
     Competition Bureau officials didn't say whether the
investigation is continuing. Unnamed sources told the paper the
bureau ``is keeping an eye on'' electricity markets in British
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate.
     On Nov. 16, Houston-based Enron, the world's biggest energy
trader, said it plans to sell a 15 percent stake in a key Indian
power project valued at $136 million.
     Powerex is the power-marketing subsidiary of the British
Columbia Hydro and Power Authority.

Competition cops raided power firms Evidence of electricity price fixing

The offices of Enron Canada Corp. and Powerex Corp. were raided this year by 
the federal Competition Bureau, which was investigating suspected price 
fixing by the two companies. 
In a search warrant application last May, the bureau alleged that in the 
summer of 1999, Enron and Powerex co-ordinated bids to drive up the price of 
electricity on the Power Pool of Alberta, the province's central electricity 
exchange, Dow Jones reported. 
Both companies confirmed searches were carried out, but said no charges have 
been laid and denied breaking any laws. 
Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron Corp. in Houston, which owns Calgary-based 
Enron Canada, said the bureau has since returned all of Enron 's files. 
Mr. Thode added the bureau has called Enron only once with a question about 
the files. ""It remains just allegations,"" he said. 
""We are confident that all of our activities have been in the rules of the 
Power Pool of Alberta and within applicable Canadian laws."" 
Both he and Wayne Cousins, a spokesman for Powerex, the trading arm of 
British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority,said they didn't know if their 
companies are still being investigated. 
""Powerex is confident that the bureau's investigation will find that the 
company has not violated the rules of the Alberta Power Pool,"" Mr. Cousins 
said. 
A spokesman from the Competition Bureau was not immediately available to 
confirm whether the investigation is continuing, but sources close to the 
bureau said it has been keeping an eye on the electricity markets in British 
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate. 
While most of the bureau's monitoring has been in the form of advice, the 
regulator has taken steps for more direct intervention, sources said. 
Deregulation of the electricity market is still new and the market is not 
established, giving companies in the sector ample opportunity to play with 
the system, sources said. 
According to the search warrant, the bureau began investigating the two 
companies when Power Pool of Alberta system controllers noticed the price for 
a megawatt of electricity frequently rose above $100. 
In the Alberta system, participants submit bids to buy or sell power for the 
following day, and the price per megawatt of power is set by the most 
expensive unit needed to meet demand. 
Until the Power Pool changed its rules on Oct. 20, 1999, a participant could 
change the amount of power it bid or offered up until 20 minutes before the 
hour of transmission. The search warrant covers the companies' actions from 
June 1, 1999, to Oct. 19, 1999. 
Mr. Thode said investigations of this nature are common in deregulating 
markets. 
""It's happened in California this year, it's happened in the Midwest, it's 
happened around the globe. It's not unusual to see this type of investigation 
occur,"" he said. 
He added the Power Pool is required to call in the federal agency whenever 
there are allegations.

2580,"Steve Smith called this afternoon.  He was anxious to know where we stood on
the issue of the third arbitrator.

He advised me that they have withdrawn Bill Paul as a proposed arbitrator.

I disclosed Judge Webster's relationship with me and my wife, and his firm's
relationship with Enron, whereupon Smith advised that they would not be
willing to have him as the neutral.

He asked me where we stood re Morris, Roberts and Sessions.  ""Sessions?""
said I.  Apparently they considered putting former judge Bill Sessions on
their list but must have decided not to do so.  (the third proposal was
Layne Phillips)

I told him that we were considering them, that Beatty was going to call
Renfrew to get more info about his relationships with them, and that we
probably were going to propose some names of our own next week.

Smith advised me that the deadline for selecting the neutral was January 15
(Monday), and that they did not intend to let the schedule slip.  I told him
that we were aware of the deadline, but as a practical matter did not see
what significance it really had since going to AAA (the remedy in the letter
agreement) would only slow the process down, not speed it up.  It reiterated
about five times that they expected us to stick to the deadline and did not
want the schedule for the arbitration to slip (has this man been speaking to
Brian Redmond secretly?).

I told Smith five times that we were not going to send them names this week,
and were unlikely to agree to one of theirs this week.  I told him that if
he insisted on an answer re his remaining three prior to Monday, that would
be easy:  the answer would be no.  I told him I preferred to take the time
to actually consider whether one of them was acceptable, and assumed that's
what he would want once he thought about it.

We should try to get back to him sometime next week with a response re his
remaining three and, unless we are agreeing to one of those, some proposals
of our own.

Richard, have you gotten any feedback from JVD?

Working Group 1 (WG1) -- Forward Contracts
An interim report was prepared from the work done in the various subgroups 
(attached)
By tomorrow, will have the final ready for the ""principals"" meeting 
tentatively scheduled for Saturday.
Final will include draft RFP, very agressive schedule ending with contracts 
signed by 1/31/01, draft standard contract, utilities' unmet load projected 
for 15 years,  and description of four products: 24x7; 6x16; capacity with 
monthly take or pays; and swing capacity.
The group will likely recommend two simultaneous RFP processes: (1) Davis' 
proposal -- what term and volume will you give me for 5.5 cents; and (2) bids 
with their own pricing and terms to meet the utilities' needs. 

Working Group 2 (WG2) -- Utility Debt
Working on a forbearance agreement
No more information out of that group
Enron in attendence; Houston credit people on Friday.

QF Group
This group met for the first time Thursday evening.
Expected to try to negotiate less volatile (and lower) QF prices using 
long-term gas tolling agreements.

Status of Major Issues from Long-Term Contracts

MAJOR ISSUE FROM WEDNESDAY:  Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they 
want the State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that 
this had been their idea all along.  In their view, the utilities provide a 
forecast and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of 
the utilities. Rest of attendees oppose this approach.  No progress made.
Kind of Auction or RFP -- Seems to be resolved as discussed above. 
Absence of Any State Officials -- Continues to concern participants.  
Everyone standing firm that no deal can be struck without State buy-in and 
relief from litigation and investigations.

Next Steps

WG1 reconvenes at 9am Friday to finish its report and work products.
Apparent joint meeting with WG2 at 10:00 am.
QF Group reconvenes at 2pm
Treasury and others will assess whether Saturday meeting with ""principals"" 
(CEOs, Governore) should take place. Tentatively planned for 3:30 pm.   "
2582,"The PX confirmed receipt of EPMI's Notice of Termination as of 1:30 pm PST 
today.  Afterwards, we tried to establish the time that the PX declared that 
PG&E and Edison were in default so that we could, if necessary at a later 
time, show that EPMI had terminated before that default.  Unfortunately, the 
PX would not come out and say that a default had occurred, and as the day 
wound down, employees at the PX became more and more taciturn.  Brett made 
all of his calls on recorded lines, but I asked him to summarize the 
conversations in writing.  I thought everyone would be interested in seeing 
this.

2590,"As I reported to you from Irvine on Friday, I attended the hearing conducted 
by Senator Dunn in Irvine, California. It was sound bite city, with no good 
press for any generator or marketer.  At the outset of the hearing Sen Dunn 
stated that his committee had been in lengthy discussions regarding 
confidentiality issues with the generators, without success, and that they 
would be sending out subpoenas for records starting on Monday(today) and that 
the production of documents from Cal ISO was to start last Friday.  Sen Dunn 
spent much of the day making his public record , posturing about the 
difficulty of getting any documents from any generator or marketer because of 
claims of confidentiality, and how unresponsive FERC has been. He got the 
FERC lawyer, Robert Pease, to testify that any confidentiality afforded to 
the bid data at Cal ISO under the FERC tariff would end after 6 months. As 
you undoubtedly read, the PUC chairwoman had nothing good to say about the 
generators. Since the subpoenas will probably be forthcoming shortly, do we 
want to have a conference call of the group to discuss what transpired at 
Friday's hearing ? I am interested in knowing  how everyone intends to 
proceed in response to any subpoenas from the Committee,particularly after 
the failed efforts with the protective order. Please call me if we have not 
talked by phone when you get this.

2591,"As I mentioned on the phone, SCE moved FERC (in the FERC docket investigati=

the California market) for a subpoena to produce information from the ISO's=

Market Surveillance Committee.  In particular, SCE is requesting informatio=

summer and Autumn of 2000.""

Here's an outline of the positions I think we should make in an answer:

The Commission should reject SoCal Edison's request for a subpoena because=
=20
FERC did not set its investigation for hearing.  Therefore, SCE's request i=

a collateral attack on the Commission's order establishing the process for=

this information to pursue its case against power marketers while denying=

marketers an opportunity to prosecute their cases by denying them an equal=
=20
opportunity to serve discovery upon others (including the UDCs).
In the alternative, the Commission should allow all parties full discovery=

rights and establish an appropriate protective order.
There may also be an argument that, since the MSC has delegated its authori=

by FERC, some of the information Edison requested might fall under the=20

having done any legal research, I don't know how good of an argument it is.

Are there any other arguments we should make?  Should we have a conference=

2592,"Ana Paula, thanks for keeping after me on this.

We have decided to rely on Ms. Cunha as the company representative to be 
present in court. This will avoid the need for an official, court appointed 
tramslator. She will be supported by Randy Pais, Nate Neuman or others as 
needed either from Houston or traveling to Brazil as needed. The SCC expat 
presence in Brazil will be greatly diminished in the next several weeks. 

Please copy Ms. Cunha  Mr. Randy Pais and Mr. Richard Sanders on all 
correspondence related to this matter. Randy Pais is the internal 
transactional lawyer at EEOS/SCC working the Cuiaba project; Richard Sanders 
is the internal litigation management lawyer at Enron Wholesale who supports 
our business unit.

I want to make sure I understand what is meant by the power of attorney and 
company representative letter. Are these the documents that appoint Ms. Cunha 
as the SCC company representative for the purposes of this matter? Sami,  if 
this is right I would have no objections for you signing these documents, but 
you don't have any position with SCC. Weren't these to be give n to Nate 
Neuman for him to have executed at the SCC office in Cuiaba?

Ana Paula, is it possible to e-mail or fax the documents to us here, and for 
us to signand fax back, or does the court need originals?

re bug issue - noted. just one question; do you think we should notify our 
suppliers in view that, if there is a problem as a result of the bugs, we 
will have to proceed against them??? they would want to have a rep to view 
the testing as well, i would think.

re joint testing - pls copy eric tan on what needs to be done once a decision 
is made on where/when the testing will be done.

re freight payment - before offering to just pay the $500,000, do you think 
we should propose it be paid to an interest bearing escrow account pending 
the results of the joint testing (or whatever other ""pending"" limitation you

"
2600,"Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and 
therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego 
has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the ""California"" 
markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of 
costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential 
refund obligations.  It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are 
being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.

I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:

In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had 
ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had 
not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its 
customers.  To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required 
would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has 
merely conditioned its rates ""subject to refund.""  Accordingly, it is 
inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits.
San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market, 
although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of 
insolvency.  It has simply said that ""there is no assurance that the actual 
wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially 
may be ordered.""
San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense.  This 
allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability 
calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated.  
This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the 
Commission March 9 order. 
The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given 
that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in 
the market for years - ""pending a final nonappealable order in these 
proceedings.""  Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15 
order finding that it would not order cost based rates.
This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to 
FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of 
wholesale power ""in the California markets"" not just for sales in the ISO and 
PX markets."
2601,"Richard:

Mark is being asked to deliver his customary ""no litigation"" legal opinion in 
connection with this project, which is a securitization of eligible 
receivables generated by EPMI and ENA as a result of power and gas 
transactions.  Please note that ENA and EPMI have been performing under a 
similar agreement for over a year; this transaction is an amendment of the 
existing transaction to add another purchaser, and we are being asked to 
deliver new legal opinions.  I understand that Derrick delivered the opinion 
on behalf of ENA and EPMI when the transaction was first closed.   

This is a revolving facility, with ENA and EPMI selling receivables to 
Sequoia on a monthly basis as those receivables are generated.  The 
transaction documents define the type of receivables that may go into this 
facility (we are required to represent that we have title, there are no 
adverse claims, there are no restrictions on assignment, etc.).   Therefore, 
as long as our back office is doing their job right, we should not be selling 
any receivables into the project that are problematic.

Are you aware of any judgment, injunction, order, decree, or pending or 
threatened litigation:

 1. Against Sequoia Financial Assets, LLC; Cherokee Finance V.O.F.; or Enron 
Finance Partners LLC (these are the special purpose entities that exist only 
for this transaction);

 2. Against ENA or EPMI (Derrick is giving the opinion for Enron Corp.) that 
would prohibit ENA or EPMI from selling/transferring/conveying receivables 
owned by them and generated in connection with power/crude/natural gas sales?

I just found out that you were extended an offer by the Big E.  I can't tell 
you how happy I am that I didn't have to question the intelligence of my 
company.  Hope you had a good birthday and I'll see you at the A&M game."
2612,"Glad to hear things are going so well.  No, I haven't spoken with Ted since 
my return...but, I did go out a few of the nights I was in London with an 
undergrad/grad school friend of his (among other people of course).  
Surprise, surprise he didn't have many supportive words for Ted as dating 
material either.  In summary he found Ted to lack attentiveness to his 
partners and maybe even fidelity.  He said the break up of Ted's marriage 
wasn't ""ALL his fault"", which is a decidedly different slant than the one Ted 
gave me the night of our chat.  I also heard that he has worked his way 
around Enron a bit.  All in all very disheartening information.  Regardless, 
I'm still glad I dated him and think I learned a lot from the whole 
situation.  Tell Brendan I said, ""Hello"" and good luck with the new role at 
work.

2614,"Em,

I cannot believe you ran into Ben Affleck!!!  I'm sure it's just the first of 
many celebrity sightings you will have in Jolly Old England.  I had an 
absolutely incredible time in San Diego with Julie.  We went to the beach 
(where I was able to lay-out and not sweat!), shopped a ton, attended the 
symphony and got messages.  All in all it was an extremely relaxing weekend.  
Yesterday, I was in Austin for a recruiting trip and got to see Corey's new 
house in Hyde Park - very cute.  

So I got back to work today, Wednesday, and still no word from Mr. Noble.  
Just to refresh, the last time I heard from him (email) was Thursday 
morning.  You'd be proud of me though as I have refrained from any form of 
contact and plan to continue that route only deviating if/when it becomes 
necessary for me to have a formal close to things.  I'm still hoping that 
will not be the case but am fully prepared for the possibility that my brief 
encounter with dating may be over for a while.

Sue"
2615,"Em,

Glad to hear that you arrived safely in your new home.  I'm sure you'll be 
adjusting to the time change for a few days, but hopefully this time you 
won't get sick.  Say, ""Hi"" to Katy for me and tell her I will email her soon 
to try and figure when is the best time to come visit.  

Now on to the business at hand.  Thought I'd let you see the last email 
exchange between Mr. Noble and myself.  Start from the bottom with my email 
and then read his response.  I would love to hear your insight on it all.

Here's my thought at this point.  I think Ted is an EXTREMELY linear person, 
in that his focus can not be split between too many different things at 
once.  To that end, I believe this project, to which he has dedicated many 
hours, has literally harnessed all of his attention.  Realizing this, I'm not 
sure exactly how I feel about it - - - Any thoughts?

I am taking every step to ensure that I leave this building at a reasonable 
hour today.  Unfortunately, it is ""bid-week"" (Nat Gas trading thing which 
translates to beaucoup deals/trading) so the odds are somewhat stacked 
against me.  Anyway, I'm going to say that as it stands right now 8:00 p.m. 
is definitely do-able.  However, I do reserve the right to alter my estimate 
when we get closer to 4:30 p.m. and I have a better idea where I stand.  
Don't let them work you too hard down there...remember, your body's not used

2618,"To signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement for SoCalGas & SDG&E:

A few more ""errata"" I plan to make, absent objection:

A. Creditworthiness Sections (1.2.3.2 and 2.2.3.2):

In 1.2.3.2 on p.21, under b., subitem ii. should have ""or"" inserted at the
end of the subitem and the ""or"" at the end of subitem iii. should be
stricken (so that the reports or forms listed in i., ii., and iii. are
alternatives to each other (customer only has to provide one of the three)
and subitems iv. and v. are additional required items).

In 2.2.3.2 on pp.36-37, make parallel changes in the ""or""s as stated above.

On p.22, under h., subitems i. through v. should be indented more than h.
and then items j), k) and l) should be renumbered i., j., k. (this will then
match section 2.2.3.2, which has the correct spacing/alphanumbering).

On p.22 and p.37, we'd like to drop the reference to ""U.S."" in the reference
to a letter of credit issued by a major ""U.S."" financial institution.
SoCalGas has realized that it has already had dealings with Canadian or
other foreign-owned customers where it was reasonable to rely on letters of
credit from major financial institutions of the parent's country.  (This
should be ok with Paul Amirault, eh?)

B. Btu content

On pp.10 (twice) and 31, the settlement says we are assuming 1,016 Btu/mcf
for the heating value of gas (subject to revision by Commission during term
of settlement).  We have the wrong units.  It is 1,016 Btu per cubic foot,
not per thousand cubic feet.  We'd propose to change the number to 1,016
Btu/cf (not ""1,016 Btu/mcf"")  On p.33, we got the units right the first time
and don't need to change them on that page.

Again, I'd appreciate you getting back to me or Brian Cherry by noon Friday
if you have any problem with the above changes.

I apologize for sending a mass email.  A few of you have tried to reach me
the last few days by phone and mail and I have been working all but the a
few hours a day that I sleep or get outside.

I have taken on two part time jobs in addition to Deer Valley. I have
started working at the internet cafe...since I used to be here a lot of the
time anyway.  I worked last night from 10-2am after my DV shift.  I waited
on my first celeb..albeit one that only I would
recognize....http://www.eonline.com/On/People/kmetko_pic.html....pretty
funny.  I also swear I saw Hugh Hefner but he was only with one woman..so it
was probably just a look alike.

The town is loaded with intense looking film types with their dark rimmed
glasses...north face down jackets, cell phones and ski caps...its pretty
funny.  This morning I went for a jog around down town and on my way back
and there are all these people getting photographed along the street...you
look at them and try to figure out if they are famous but they all look like
any other guy.  The cafe is a hub for a lot of the news media to send out
their stories and photographs of the fest.  There are 25ish computers in
this cafe and all are being used right now..it is very busy.

I also started work at Windy Ridge Cafe which is a new cafe/bakery in town
that is geared towards locals only business.  Business is booming since
they've been open. I was going to work there initially but declined bc I
felt I would be too busy with Deer Valley.  I started eating there everyday
when they opened and once I saw the great things they were doing I decided I
had to work there.  I typically go in for 5-6 hours starting at 7am....then
I have 2 hrs off then go into DV to work in the evening.  Windy Ridge
doesn't really feel like work. I really like the pastry chef. Her work has
great integrity and I would be proud to call her creations my own. I have
been able to do some savory food as well like casseroles and vegetable
tarts.

Deer Valley is also good.  I work mostly evenings and prepare sauces,
desserts, and plate for the two restaurants at the lodge and any evening
banquet business.  I don't do a lot of production at DV but I am gaining
experience in kitchen organization and working a la minut to get orders out.

It snowed yesterday for the first time in over a week.  And the sun is
shining brightly today. I will report to work shortly and work a banquet
tonight for some Sundance people.  I hope to you all soon when I have more
time to write individually.  I will also be coming home on Saturday.

Take care,
Mo.

2625,"Em,

So, of course, I spent this whole past weekend trying to figure out how I 
want to handle this ""situation"".  Basically I've decided the following:
 1.  I will agree to meet him for a beer and a chat (I'm going to suggest 
Molina's - I think it's a good location, public enough & private enough)
 2.  I will be calling and leaving a message with him to let him know I will 
meet with him, NO email... and will request that he do me the same courtesy.
 3.  I will let him do the talking (I mean he's the one that wants to have a 
chat so he must have something to say)...at least to begin with
 4.  I will NOT be a push-over 

Well, what do you think?  Any suggestions/recommendations?  I am very new to 
this whole relationship discussion thing.  More importantly, do you think 
there is ANYTHING he could say/do that would or should allow him a second 
chance?  Right now I don't know if there is, but unlike you (and you know 
this about me) I do believe in second chances.  That does not mean that a 
second chance is a given in this situation.  Get back to me when you get a 
chance.  

Susan

- - I just know I would always regret not meeting with him Em.  This is a 
chance for me to prove that I can handle myself with maturity and dignity 
even with my emotions on the line.  I think ultimately, regardless of the 
outcome, it will make me a stronger person.  By the way,  we will definitely 
cover the past relationships during this chat, that is a given.

2628,"Elizabeth, Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options.  I've 
answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues.  If you 
need anything further please don't hesitate to call.

?  Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order 
to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be 
allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights 
by permanently releasing this contract?    YES.

?   Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index 
of Customers and/or the Transactional Report?  YES.

? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ 
and choose to keep or transfer the option rights?   YES.  The shipper could 
even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights.

? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within 
the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate?  The 
option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport 
rate.  If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's ""negotiated"".  
Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated.  We are not 100% 
positive that FERC will agree with us on this issue."

Per conversation with Jeff Kinneman who was in London this week, London Credt 
Trading will be trading in Bank default swaps .  The name of the entity is 
still to be determined.  Jeff will be authorized to execute trades for the

dealing with the exploration side of the company last year.  We agreed to (1) 
mark up the Flying J form AND (2) reissue the Industrial Master that had been 
negotiated last year (with our form changes).  John Scales (exploration side) 
wouldn't agree to the MAC at the last minute.  Do you want to handle?  Just 
let me know.  Sara"

"
2666,"I think that you are absolutely correct in the assessment of the quantity 
description, but this is the language that we use in all the Physical 
Products and I would prefer not to change it - for the same reason that we 
are making the Index and Loadshape language 'match' both Physical and 
Financial Products, I don't want to change something that's already being 
used extensively in the Physical Products. 

However, Mark Taylor and I do suggest that we clarify how the Notional 
Quantity is derived - which I think helps solve the issue; please see the 
attached mark-up.



Sara - please call me ASAP on this.

2679,"Diana: 

I negotiated the Enron North America Corp.  ISDA Master Agreement with the 
""President and Fellows of Harvard University"" (together with John Suttle).  
Harvard is interested in metals trading.  What is the entity trading metals 
(financial)?  Will you evaluate the credit?

Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara "
2680,"Thanks for the clarification. I originally thought we were talking about an 
ISDA arrangement and that's why I suggested Sara to assist.

I will visit with John Suttle today and determine the best way forward on the 
credit-related language for this physical deal. We will revert back to you 
very shortly.

Both ENA (rate) and Enron Corp.(equity forwards)  are seekig master 
agreements with MSCS. Rod prepared a credit worksheet for the ENA agreement 
in June, 2000 and I will fax a copy to you separately.

(1)  With respect to the ENA master, is the ENA credit worksheet still 
current or does it need to be changed?

(2)  With respect to the Enron Corp. master (which will not have a CSA or an 
Enron Corp. guaranty), what cap should we request from Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter & Co.?  Should it be $25MM as requested in the ENA document?

Please let me know.  "
2683,"FYI.   Information Risk Management  (""IRM"") is running a virus check on 
O:\Common\legal on a daily basis and it was reported this morning that  
during the last two days ""no viruses"" were identified.  

 IRM recommends that we do the following to protect against viruses:

Click on Start->run and type (or you can cut and paste):

""C:\Program Files\McAfee\virusScan NT\mcconsol.exe"" click Okay

You will get a message from ""Virus Scan NT Anti-virus Console"" with a status 
report

When you get into the program, click on help and then about.  The screen 
should look like this:



If it doesn't, either call tech support and place a call, or log out properly 
at night.  

To log out properly, click on start->shut down and either restart the 
computer or close all programs and log on as a different user.  This will 
allow the computer to receive the proper version of the virus scan engine and 
dat file.

2684,"Please put on my calendar.  SS
"
2685,"Earlier this year, I negotiated this agreement with GS&C.  I cannot locate 
the agreement so GS&C is sending a copy.  The Enron party is ENA.  We now 
need to amend the authorized trader list which I will email to you.  ENA's 
use of GS&C's platform is for trading US treasuries, agencies, money market, 
corporates, JGB's.  We need to:

(1)  remove Harry Arora (who was the sole authorized trader)

(2)  add the following:       Darren Delage
   Shane Dallmann
   Ellen Su
   Pushkar Shahi
   Gary Hickerson

THIS IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR GARY AND WE SHOULD TRY TO COMPLETE TODAY.

signing Omnibus Confirms that had credit terms (i.e. Annex B and B-1).  Can 
you tell us whether there are any counterparties that aren't signing this 
type of confirm?  Because collateral is involved, from a legal standpoint, 
the only way that we may be able to enforce our rights vis a vis the 
counterparty and/or other creditors is if we can demonstrate that our 
counterparty entered into a valid security agreement with us.  I look forward

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1. OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as accuratel=
y=20
as possible all futures and options gross positions as of close-of business=
=20
on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the estimated current gros=
s=20
positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.  The OPC must be=20
submitted not later than 9:00 AM.

2.   OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUEST FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring option=
=20
with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject to=20
automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted=
=20
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its=
=20
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other=20
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic abandonme=
nt=20
unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When submitting an E/=
A=20
form, please note the following:

(a) An E/A form must be submitted not later than 5:00 PM.
(b) Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices, which ar=
e=20
subject to automatic
Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in strike prices, whi=
ch=20
are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c) If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a strike=
=20
price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position in a=
=20
strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify Clearing =
by=20
telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an officer availabl=
e=20

=20
assure submission  of the CM's E/A forms.

3. OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,=20

If=20
some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for position=
=20
liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of expiration=
=20
and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your projected=20
position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of actual traded=
=20
volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel correction=
=20
trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore do not=20

review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of close-of-business on=
=20

r=20
automatic), whether the strike is In, At or Out of the money, and the=20

2718, 
2719,"I have spoken with  Sara re. amending our current Chase ISDA to reflect 
rehypothecation. She is quite happy to move forward with this but requires 
Credit's approval to amend the doc. 

Additionally I have asked her to also look at the ISDA that Enron has with 
Mahonia to ensure that our doc also permits rehypothecation. She is working 
with Teresa Bushman on this.

Given that both docs require review, & amendments will require credit 
approval, it will be beneficial for us all to meet to discuss any outstanding 
issues. I have asked that a meeting be arranged early next week.to that end.

Regards,

Soma"
2720,"Sara:

Thanks for the additional information and the recommended changes, each of
which we accept.

In order to accommodate the deletion of 9(b), we recommend revising your
number 6 to read as follows:

6. Substitution

 (a) Paragraph 9(b) is hereby deleted in its entirety.

 (b) Seller shall not retain custody of any Purchased Securities
under any Transaction governed by this Agreement.

NOTICES:  Your suggested language regarding notices is potentially
problematic.  Under the Paragraph 13 of the MRA, notices may made orally,
""to be confirmed promptly in writing...."", and confirmation of delivery is
not expressly relevant.  The unquestionable ability to make oral margin
calls pursuant to Paragraph 4 is vital in fast-moving market conditions, and
was expressly included in the standard agreement to avoid any doubt as to
their validity.  In the default context (Paragraph 11), proof of delivery of
written notice is of no concern because the exercise of a party's rights
under that Paragraph is not contingent upon delivery of notice.  Notice must
be given ""as promptly as practicable.""  We believe that the proposed
language could cause confusion or uncertainty regarding the validity of oral
margin calls and would conflict with the operative provisions of Paragraph
11.  We therefore request deletion of your number 8.

NON-ASSIGNABILITY:  As we discussed earlier today, we have a general
aversion to assignments of repurchase transactions due to our regulatory
obligations as a broker-dealers.  For that reason, we must be free to
withhold consent to assignment with confidence that such withholding will
not be challenged as ""unreasonable.""  We therefore request deletion of your
number 9.

We are still reviewing your proposals regarding SETOFF and LIMITED
LIABILITY.  I will also have to review Section 5-1401 of the NYGOL before
commenting on that.

I look forward to the prompt completion of our negotiations.  Thanks again
for the information and recommendations.

Best regards,
Andy Waskow

Congratulations on your promotion!

I need an update on the back-office relationship between Enron Credit Inc.

I assume there is a power of attorney from ECI to someone in London.  Or will 
ECI trades be confirmed in the U.S.?

I received a call from someone in London inquiring as to whether Greg Whalley 
could sign for ENA because he was in London.  I believe this was in relation 
to the credit business.  Are U.K. traders booking credit deals in the name of 
ENA or is this some type of back-office function performed on behalf of ENA?  
Any reason not to use ECI or ECL  here?

 Also, can you send a copy of the services agreement (if any) between any

Barbara and Kerry are traveling to Missouri tommorrow to negotiate with 
Ameren.  This bill which will be an industrial buy-through only (due to 
complications with Constitutional Amendments in Missouri involving a 
requirement for a referendum for any tax law changes).   The bill applies to 
industrials greater than 1 MW in Ameren and 2 MW everywhere else.  In 
speaking to EES, they want us to try and get the threshold reduced to 500kw 
to 1mw.  ENA wants load following in order to sell blocks of power to large 
industrials.  In addition, there are a host of other issues, including, 
insufficient regulatory review for shifting generation into a genco, no code 
of conduct for that genco and Illinois-styled stranded cost recovery.  Kerry 
and Barbara have a tough assignment to get anything here.  We thought it 
would be best to see how these negotiations go before formulating what kind 
of message we would like Ken Lay to deliver if he is willing.  To make 
matters worse, the industrial group has already caved on the bill.  Kerry and 
Barbara, I believe are also meeting with the consumer advocates office and 
the Commission staff who have not signed off on the bill.  We should know 
more in the next day or two.  Nothing will happen at the legislature until 
next week.

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy
Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: March 20, 2001

RE: Commission Actions to Increase Supply and Decrease
Consumption in the Western United States--Key Points for
EPSA Comments Due MARCH 30TH

As we previously reported, on March 14, 2001, FERC announced certain actions 
to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in 
an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas 
Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further 
Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption.  The 
following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to ""immediately 
help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory 
incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure.""  The 
Commission also invited comments on certain proposals.  This memo includes a 
list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March 30th.

Overview of Order

The Order reflects a thorough review of  ""all of [FERC's] rate and facility 
certification authorities in the areas of electric energy, natural gas, 
hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy 
supply""; however, the Commission noted that its authority is ""somewhat 
limited.""  While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the 
lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission, 
as well as demand reduction measures, the Commission noted that the impact of 
California's energy shortage on the Western Interconnection ""underscores the 
regional, interstate nature of the energy marketplace.""  Accordingly, it 
encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for 
western markets.

EPSA appreciates the Commission's effort to exercise the full extent of its 
authority to help ease the West's energy problems.  Taken together, the 
Commission's proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational 
solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West.  Most importantly, the 
Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment, 
including increased generation, transmission and natural gas pipeline 
facilities.

The Commission's immediate actions, which will expire on December 31, 2001, 
include:

-Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to 
provide FERC with a list of short-term grid enhancements.

-Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and 
fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities (QF).

-Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup 
and self-generation for businesses with prior notice waivers and market-based 
rate authorization.

-Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale 
market-based rates.

The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals, including:

-Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs.

-Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly 
increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term.

-10-year depreciation for short-term transmission projects, and 15-year 
depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service 
by November 1, 2002.

-Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA  o210(d) to help 
alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load.

EPSA's Comments

In its conclusion, the Commission stated that comments should be ""concise and 
focused.""  Accordingly, we suggest that EPSA's comments focus on the 
following areas:

? Applaud the Commission's effort to increase supplies from QFs, but 
encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to 
sell to creditworthy parties.

? We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the 
relative merits of an incremental versus a ""rolled in"" approach to 
interconnection and upgrade costs.  Therefore, while we may lack a consensus 
on the question as a final policy position, we believe that the extreme 
circumstances surrounding the Order, and the urgent need to move power 
quickly into the Western system, make it wise to endorse FERC's instant 
recommendation.

? The Commission's proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating 
to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher 
ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps.  The 
Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in 
regional transmission organizations.  However, given the current situation 
and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher 
ROE, EPSA could support this proposal.

? Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on 
the energy supply system.  Therefore, the Commission's proposed waivers of 
blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects, 
are favorable developments.

We will discuss the Order and EPSA's comments during tomorrow's Regulatory 
Affairs/Power Marketers' conference call.  In addition, we have been asked to 
consider what type of short-term relief could be included in federal 
legislation.  We will discuss this question as well.  To access the call, 
dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call. In the meantime,

DRAFT of a business plan  (more detail than above)"
2769,"Rick,

Jane Wilson leaving is a loss to us professionally as well as to me 
personally. I will really miss Jane. I would like to speak with you about 
regulatory coverage. One relatively quick thing I would like to have happen 
is to get Amr Ibrahim out here for a few weeks. I'm thinking about perhaps 
overlapping with Jane for one full week before she leaves (he would be here 
on Monday, June 11) and have him remain for 2 full weeks after Jane is gone.  
Primary purpose in having Amr here is to oversee transition from Jane to our 
local team on the ground, who Jane has trained. Plus Amr can evaluate our 
regulatory needs and ensure that we have the right quality and number of 
people. Obviously, we are in a wind-down mode in India, but this will take 
several months (perhaps up to a year), and there will be a number of 
legal/regulatory matters to deal with. Finally, I would feel comfortable if 
you had someone on ground here, such as Amr,  for a while serving as your 
eyes and ears, so that you can be comfortable that regulatory affairs are 
being handled properly.

I suggest Amr because he is well known out here, he has done a very good job 
and is well respected. If you would prefer someone else come out in this 
interim period, let's discuss that. I will admit that I do not have any idea 
what Amr is working on right now so I don't know his time availability.

I recommend we speak on Thursday or Friday morning. I have phone calls on 
Thursday from about 8:30am Houston time until 10:30 am Houston time. On 
Friday, I have calls from 8:30 am to 9:30 am. If we could speak either before 
this or after that, that would be fine.
  
Please either send me an e-mail and a phone number where I can reach you, or 
you can call me in the office at 91-22-653-4034, or cell phone at 
9198200-20090.

That spokesperson says that deregulation brings lower reliability due to reduction in operating margins.  I don't know if Enron was asked to participate in either of these, but the results, if solely based on input of those that don't want deregulation, could certainly be used to slow things down."

Tonight at 7pm, Jim McGreevey will show, once again, why is he the right 
change for New Jersey.

Be sure to tune into WABC-New York (Channel 7) or WPVI-Philadelphia (Channel 
6) to catch Jim going head to head with Bret Schundler in the fourth of five 
live gubernatorial debates.

In the previous three debates, Jim has confidently laid out his plans to 
fight for New Jersey's middle and working class, while Bret's words only 
served to re-enforce his out-of-touch, extremist views.

Time and time again, when confronted with the fact that his platform is 
simply not resonating with the voters of New Jersey, Bret Schundler has 
resorted to petty name-calling.  And, by all means, this is not a new 
phenomenon.

In fact, during the Republican primary, Schundler succeeded in alienating a 
large bloc of moderate Republicans by referring to Acting Governor 
DiFrancesco as a ""moron"" and Congressman Franks as a ""liar.""

As more and more voters agree with Jim McGreevey's positions on education, 
auto insurance, property taxes and the environment, the Schundler Campaign 
has gotten more and more desperate.

These next four years are going to be for the hard working people and 
families of New Jersey who deserve a government - and a governor - who works 
for them.

So, tune in tonight at 7pm to watch our next Governor, Jim McGreevey, show 
everyone why he is the right change for New Jersey.

2780,"As most of you are aware, the FERC mediator yesterday submitted his 
recommendation to the agency, culminating a 15-day mediation process. Among 
the mediator's recommendations is that FERC convene an evidentiary hearing, 
to close within 60 days, to determine the offset or refund liability of 
suppliers of energy, including Enron, into the California's spot markets.  I 
expect FERC to act on the recommendation early next week and issue an order 
directing that a hearing be convened within possibly a week or less.  
Accordingly, getting organized is an imperative.

Several of us participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss whether 
Enron should retain Seabron Adamson of Frontier Economics to serve as Enron's 
expert in the hearing.  The decision was made to retain Seabron for this 
purpose.  Seabron has informed me that he can come to Washington to start 
preparing discovery and developing a theory for Enron's case.  The discovery 
that Enron pursues will obviously need to be coordinated with litigation 
counsel representing Enron in the various California civil litigations and 
investigations.

The mediator's recommendation largely ignores two of the issues that were set 
for mediation (moving CA power supply to the forward markets and restoring 
creditworthiness of CA purchasers) and instead deals exclusively with the 
third issue:  Did any supplier overcharge for post-October 1, 2000, 
short-term (24 hrs or less) sales into the PX and ISO and, if so, should the 
supplier refund the overcharge or have it offset against amounts owed the 
supplier?

The mediator did not find a specific overcharge amount. Instead, he opined 
that, while not the $8.9 billion claimed by the CA delegation, overcharges 
""do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billion 
dollars in an aggregate sum.""

Per the mediator's recommendation, the evidentiary hearing should address the 
details of a methodology for determining how much each supplier overcharged.  
The ""single"" methodology recommended by the mediator is a modified, 
retroactive application of the price ceiling that FERC ordered imposed 
prospectively on the entire west in a June 19 order.  That methodology 
classes as an overcharge any amount charged between October 2, 2000, and May 
28, 2001, that exceeded the operating cost of the least efficient gas-fired 
turbine dispatched in CA in an hour plus an adder for O&M, a credit premium 
and NOx.  The recommended methodology deviates from the prospective price 
ceiling in several respects, including that it would be applied in all hours, 
without discount, and would reflect actual heat rates and separate actual 
hourly natural gas prices for southern CA and northern CA, resulting in two 
separate proxy prices.

The mediator recommends that this methodology be applied to all suppliers, 
even those that did not supply power wholly from gas-fired turbines.   
Nevertheless, in a contradictory passage, the mediator goes on to recognize 
that his recommended methodology ""may not be appropriate for all sellers,"" 
but that any sellers advocating a different methodology ""should bear the 
burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the 
methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period..""  (emphasis 
added).

Assuming that the agency largely follows the recommendation of the mediator, 
then it appears Enron, working through Seabron, can pursue one or two basic 
theories.  First and most simply, Enron can accede to the mediator's 
methodology and work with the large generators (Duke, Reliant, Dynegy, 
Mirant) to force up the proxy price (and lower the overcharge amount) that 
the mediator's methodology produces.  Alternatively, in addition to trying to 
force up the proxy price, Enron can try to develop a theory that the 
mediator's methodology either should not apply to power marketers or should 
apply differently to them.  This second approach will likely be joined by 
other non-thermal generator suppliers, such as PowerEx.  The obvious risk in 
pursing this second approach is that Enron might become exposed to discovery 
into the cost basis of its book over the entire refund period..

Those of you who will need or want to discuss the issues with Seabron, please 
respond by letting me know as between Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next 
week, which works better for you for a meeting in Washington or a 
teleconference.  "

2783,"I met this morning with three officials from the US Consulate: Mitchell 
Optican (Political and Economic Affairs Consul ), Patrick Santillo (Trade 
Consul) and Peter Dykeman (Trade 
Specialist).                                     They expressed the view 
that, from their perspective, there was a very real risk that  restructuring 
in Ontario will not proceed quickly  because of the political complications 
coming out of California.  However, the Consulate has  also made a decision 
to do what it  can to protect US commercial interests here -  the two 
interests they identified were those of Enron and 
Sithe.                                 They were  eager to explore  whether 
there was an interim step or half way measure that would protect our 
interests while allowing the government to play out the political agenda of 
proceeding (and being seen to proceed) cautiously. I suggested that the only 
such measure would be a scenario under which the IMO administered spot  
market (including the market for wholesale industrials)  opened this November 
and the retail market followed in the  Spring. There are arguments in favour 
of this approach : greater confidence in IMO system readiness compared to the 
distributor EBT/CIS systems; greater commitment of the IMO to market opening; 
likely support from OPG  to this since it could secure access to NY and 
proceed with FERC marketer authorization application;  it would enhance OPG's 
announced divestiture program re 4000 MW;  and consumers/distributors could 
be protected through a smoothed price plus a deferral account mechanism 
pending full retail access.                                              I 
explained OPG's position in NY where OPG had obtained a waiver of the NYISO 
tariff's ""reciprocity"" provisions on the basis of Dave Goulding's assurances 
in February 2001 that the market would open this year.  They understood and 
agreed that it was easier and preferable for  the Consulate to raise with the 
gov't the real potential that OPG's access may be lost unless the wholesale 
market opens this year.                                 I have committed to 
outlining a plan that focusses on wholesale market opening this Fall and 
providing it to them next week.  The model will obviously have to be 
consistent with the ""four guiding principles"" enunciated by the Premier and 
Minister of Energy:  ""protecting consumers and offering choice"", creating a 
strong business climate with a reliable supply of electricity"", ""protecting 
the environment"", and ""encouraging new ways of doing business and supporting 
the search for alternative sources of 
power"".                                                                       
                                                                              
     We are meeting again on Thursday to discuss with the Consul General 
""Poncho"" Huddle.   They are prepared to: a) get it included in Governor 
Pataki's  statements when he meets with Harris at a NY/Ontario  economic 
summit in Niagara Falls/Buffalo in late June, b) have the  new Ambassador 
include it in an early speech in Toronto, and speak to the Premier and 
others, and c) press the issue with their own contacts in Energy and Finance 
in 
Ontario.

The EPSA Leg. Affairs Committee is having a special meeting this afternoon (out of the normal biweekly cycle) to discuss how EPSA should respond to the Barton RTO discussion draft.  In addition to the e-mail yesterday morning, I spoke in person with Gene Peters of the EPSA staff to convey our strongly held view that mere ""technical corrections"" were not enough to fix the Barton RTO proposal, as the EPSA draft letter stated.  Gene came around because in a subsequent meeting we had with Rep. Chip Pickering (R-MS), a member of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, Gene said that silence would be better than what is in the Barton draft.

He did indicate to me (not to Pickering) that some EPSA members, without naming them, didn't want to come down too hard on Barton because in their view the draft could have been worse.  These unnamed companies (or company?) claim to have told of earlier versions not released that would have been more restrictive on FERC's discretion.  Some companies also think FERC could wiggle out of the strictures of the draft.  I told Gene that there is no way to wiggle out of the definitions of minimum size/scope that FERC would be forced to accept and the various procedural advantages for recalcitrant utilities.

While I am checking with counterparts at other EPSA members in advance of the afternoon meeting, you might want to do the same as you speak with contacts at other EPSA members.  I am confident we can get the EPSA letter to better reflect our position -- my suspicion is that the unnamed company Gene referred to is Reliant, but I can't prove it.

the penalties to the MAE price. Why surrender it now? 

Why do we have to abide by ABRADEE's desires? 

This is not a religious issue only.  There are a few US$ million left on the 
table.

How many US$ million are on the table for Enron?

 - Ballpark, possibly  US$20f or Elektro's long position  (60 in EBITDA * 
(680-460)/680)
 - A lot, lot more for Eletrobolt (perhaps to the point of killing the 
project, as Joao Albuquerque stated)

on Public Hearing 02/2001, advocating for an increase in the cost of defict 
to US$ 2350/MWh. The trading group (Remi, David) were adamant about this

We have had several conference calls since last Saturday. Perhaps you should 
talk to Orlando and join us from now on. This subject is in state of flux.

As you know, those measures triggered a hostile reaction from D/Cs and from 
Gs. 

Aneel (Jose Mario and Jose Alves) called me on Saturday asking for help. We 
discussed this subject internally over the weekend.

On Monday, Joao defended ANEEL in the COEX meeting. However, we were the only 
ones. Other players were very angry. They perceived the action as pure 
intervention (despite necessary and timely for most). ANEEL was informed 
about the COEX reaction and thanked us for our position.

We examined the Resolutions in great detail. Unfortunately, it seems that 
ANEEL went far beyond its institutional responsibilities. The substance is 
OK. The format is legally weak.

Our strategy (we will try to sell to Abradee, CBIIE, COEX and ABRACEEL) is to 
remove the spotlight from the legal arguments and propose to our industry 
peers to focus on the design of a new Market agreement (to create a sense of 
buy-in). We know that the changes will be only cosmetic. The basic principles 
of the resolution should be maintained.

As per Enron's suggestion, I spoke to ANEEL again (Jose Mario and Jose Alves) 
showing them how difficult the situation is. In our view, thard he only way 
to validate the measures is to write a new agreement (Fred and Debora are 
working on that). I was open in saying that the Resolution are weak from a 
legal standpoint. They agreed with us. Publicly they say otherwise. They said 
they are willing to negotiate. We also expressed our view to ANEEL that part 
of the reaction is parochial: some COEX members will lose their jobs. ANEEL 
agrees. That is why they are inviting all CEOs and Chairmen of the Board to a 
meeting tomorrow, where ANEEL will explain what is happening and ask for 
support from top management.

Why has ANEEL approached us? Perhaps two reasons: 1) They know we defend 
markets 2) We wrote Informativo Regulat?rio # 3, attached (which basically 
purports the replacement of COEX by a professional Board - I discussed those 
issues with Rick Shapiro before the IR was issued to understand Enron's view 
on power pool governance)

Your comments/involvement would be very important. It is a pretty delicate 
and messy situation. 

My personal view.

1) This was a necessary evil. MAE would not function otherwise. Our merchant 
plants would be in jeopardy.
2) I would dare to say that this is a ""window of opportunity"" to get MAE 
working (and therefore our long term strategy)
3) However, the way ANEEL did was disastrous. They should have acted long 
before. (imposing gradual penalties). Now they suddenly ""fired"" 26 CEOs of 
the largest utilities in Brazil
4) We should support ANEEL. However, it has to be in a very diplomatic way. 
Orlando will take care of Abradee. Joao - COEX. S,rgio CBIEE. We have to walk 
over a fine line. If we push to hard, they will reject Enron (together with 
ANEEL's Resolution) 
5) We should be the champions in drafting a new Market Agreement

Further to the PRC Committee Meeting please find attached the first draft of 
the peer group mapping by function. It was decided that each member would 
review the proposal to move from 4 peer groups to 3 for Mid Year. 

The attached was completed some weeks ago by the HR leads in your business 
Unit and is based on a McKinsey study requested by Jeff Skilling and Steve 
Kean.

Under your review of the attached information, please focus on the final two 
pages that show the 'strawman' on how the functions fell out under the 
proposed peer group 
structure.

I have copied in the HR leads for your business area. They have been 
instrumental in completing the mapping and will meet with you to provide any 
specific information you require concerning placements with your business 
area.

I would point out that there does appear to be some inconsistencies in 
function placements within the peer groups for some business units; it will 
be our primary focus at the next meeting to resolves these issues.

Your assistants have been contacted regarding the time and date of our next 
meeting under separate cover. For our London colleagues we will aim for a

2817,"All--here's some thoughts on our work with the Governors going forward thru the next 3 to 6 months.  Although Paul and I have talked about picking 4 or 5 specific issues or solutions to focus on, I am a bit concerned that we will not be able to get them to focus on more than 1 or 2.  We also have to give them some constituent cover, and the other overriding concern is that the Republicans will generally only support what Cheney/Bush support.  The Republican governors are clearly looking at the WGA as a vehicle to ""cover"" their interests as well as an entity to come up with a solution for new and improved transmission systems.  

Here's a few strategies we've been talking about in addition to what we're doing at the WGA transmission workshop meetings:


	1.  Convince the Governors that they need to send a strong message to all stakeholders that they expect RTO west to have met identified goals and guidelines by a certain date and be up and running by a date  beyond that.  We would need to come up with that timeline in very short order, as the best shot we would have in getting those dates in the public domain on record would be thru the energy resolutions that will be passed at the WGA annual conference in August.  This would be a long shot because of all of the incumbent interests.  However, if we could get a VERY simple message on this goal we might have a shot.  


	2. Educate/mobilize the Governors to petition FERC to make sure that the refund settlement mania doesn't extend outside sales in California. Paul can talk about this a little more in depth tomorrow"
2818,"Here's a summary:

? WGU focuses on ""competency-based education""--apparently it gives credit for 
job experience, etc.  
? Degrees offered include:  AS, BS, MS in Learning and Technology, Graduate 
Certificates in Technology and Instructional Design, and an Undergraduate 
Certificate.  Focus is teaching and information technology.
? They appear to offer course-work as an employee-benefit and the potential 
to earn a college degree through ""distance learning""--like University of 
Phoenix.
? On 11.27.00, WGU received ""Candidate For Accreditation"" status by the 
Inter-Regional Accrediting Committee (IRAC).  
? WGU partners with AT&T, Cisco Systems, Novell, Sun Microsystems, and 3Com.
? WGU has a ""National Advisory Board,"" which aids WGU in planning and 
implementation.  The NAB consists of AOL, Apple, AT&T, Cisco Systems, 
Convergys, Drake International, IBM, ITP, KPMG Consulting, Micron, Microsoft, 
Novell, SallieMae, SCT, Sun Microsystems, and 3Com
? Participating States include all the WGA States:  the 12 Western states, 
Guam, Indiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas.
? Board of Trustees includes: the Chairman of 3Com, a VP of Sun, President 
Northern Arizona University, Representative from the Alfred P. Sloan 
Foundation, VP Gov't Affairs for AT&T, Nebraska Coordinating Commission on 
Higher Education, Roy Romer, General Manager of Global Education Industry for 
IBM, and Governor's Geringer, Knowles, Locke, and Leavitt.
? Governor Leavitt is Co-Chair with Governor Locke.  "

RE: Draft EPSA Brief to the Supreme Court in the Appeal of
      Order No. 888
      ? Comments due by Friday, April 13th

Attached is a draft of the brief EPSA's counsel has drafted for filing in 
support of Enron's position in the U.S. Supreme Court appeal of Order No. 
888.  EPSA's brief focuses on how FERC's failure to assert jurisdiction over 
interstate transmission bundled with retail power sales creates a regulatory 
gap that allows vertically integrated utilities substantial competitive 
advantages and creates incentives for discrimination.

Please review the draft brief and provide written comments to Julie Simon at

The questions that Gas Daily is receiving most likely pertain to the issue 
that Nicor was closed on Friday but the weekend index published substantially 
different from the Thursday index.  We did not transact at Nicor City Gate on 
Friday and did not submit a change in trades to Gas Daily.  I will discuss 
this with you tomorrow.

It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years, it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard Business School this fall.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Dear John Lavorato, Hunter Shively, Andy Lewis, and Chris Gaskill:

I regret to inform you that I will be resigning from the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture and will await further direction in the effort to fulfill my current obligations.  It is definitely with a bit of sadness that I have arrived at the conclusion to leave the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture, but I believe that it is in the best interest of my young career.  In addition, after signing a UBS offer letter I have realized over the last two days that given my current assignment it would be very difficult for me to continue to be motivated and to produce in the manner that would please both management and myself. Therefore I believe it is in the best interest of both parties that I leave the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture. Although this decision was not an easy one for me to make, I have decided to pursue other opportunities. 
I am extremely grateful for the opportunities I have been given here in this organization and for the investments that both you as individuals and the organization as a whole have made in my personal career development.  I believe I have worked hard at Enron and I trust that I made significant value adding contributions. It is because of my experience here and the tutelage that all of you have given me that I have my current knowledge and opportunities. I am very grateful for all of my experiences here at Enron/UBS Warburg, and I would like to personally thank all of you guys upon your return from Connecticut.  I will also make a concerted effort to maintain contact with all of you.
UBS Warburg Energy will certainly be a successful organization and I wish you all the best of luck with the exciting challenge of rebuilding this great business.
I await your direction upon receiving my intention to resign, and I offer my services in order to make the process as smooth as possible. 

Sincerely,
Denver Plachy

s done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (kne=

`Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared a=

11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be suffi=

 as a Fantasy player at this point.    Giants , DT NYG - Matty Updated 11/2=
0/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-r=
epaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fa=
ct, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cri=
s Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on =
a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the=
 rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 T=
he Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as=
 the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start f=
or most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01=
 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thurs=
day's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fant=
asy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Ru! ss! ell Updated 11/20/01=
 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after under=
going knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Ba=
ltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than =
usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter =
Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will li=
kely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll hel=
p keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to giv=
e Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL -=
 Bass/Hull Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game agai=
nst Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job,"" Smi=
th told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbe=
rs due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all pos=
sible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered b=
ruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some pr=
actice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlan=
ta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could=
 turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 1! 1.!   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week a=
fter missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain=
 to play on Sunday against San Diego.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/20/01 Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a=
 hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only=

Home,
A sort of honor, not a building site,
Wherever we are, when, if we chose, we might,
Be somewhere else, but trust that we have chosen right.

W.H. Auden

The view from my living room, a southern view, begins with a mess of red
tiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic (Golden Horn).  On the other side
of the Halic (a river-harbor, once beautiful and fast flowing, now stalled
and polluted) are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium (later to be
called Constantinople, later still Istanbul) was founded nearly six
centuries before the birth of Christ.  Above a cement colored smear of
apartment buildings of much more recent vintage, I can make out the outlines
of towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the 500's AD.
I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques, built in the
1500's during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman, Suleyman the
Magnificent.  Otherwise, the hillsides of Eski (Old) Istanbul are covered by
the before mentioned apartment buildings, relatively new but already
appearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement.  They are, I
suppose, full of people who for the most part work far too much for far too
little and who must wonder, more and more, with each passing day, about the
relevance of their muezzins' cries.  Incongruously, hundreds, maybe
thousands, of sea gulls, screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters, dip and
rise in the air space between me and all of that.

I recently bought a cheap guitar (I left a better one back in the States)
from my friend Ilyas, and from time to time I sit looking out my window
while playing sad songs from America's south (the easiest kind to play --
slow, with three chords and, as Bono [pretentiously] said, the truth).  This
evening, I did just that, singing and playing, among others, a song by Steve
Earle, in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long ago
love (""Was I off somewhere, or maybe just too high?"") and one by Lucinda
Williams, who sings about hitting the road in order to forget (""When I get
to Baton Rouge, I won't cry a tear for you"").  A pile of clouds staacked up
on the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset, but the invisible sun
still makes its presence know, bordering them crimson.  I watch the
neddle-like vapor trail of a jet crawl west -- until it too disappears
behind the clouds -- all the time wondering about when I too will be heading
in that same direction.

What will it be like to be in America again?  I don't think I've ever
developed particularly deep psychic connections with places, though that is
not to say I haven't loved the places I've lived.  I truly adore San
Francisco and I always come to Dallas's defense.  I appreciate Aurora
(Illinois) and miss Westfield (New Jersey), often wondering what it would
have been like to have finished my growing up there.  But because, perhaps,
I ultimately value experience more than comfort -- and, don't get me wrong,
I value comfort a great deal -- maybe I haven't been able to convince
myself, at some critical, fundamental level, to believe that settling down
in one place (or, come to think of it, with one person) for the rest of my
life is an  ultimate goal.  Of course, I worry about where this all might
lead, with the specter of absolute -- and perhaps, God forbid, unbearable --
loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility.  But, then again, maybe I'm
just looking for the ultimate home, and will burrow in deeply once I've
found it.

My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home after
what was, for me at least, a wonderful ten-day visit.  They weren't so sure
about the Boza (a sweet, slightly fermented drink made from millet) I
accosted them with at a tiny caf? in the center of Eski Istanbul, but they
tried it anyway.  Later, forgetting about how scared I had been the first
time I was there, I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on a
post-dusk walk through the ""working class"" Kucuk Pazar neighborhood (on our
way to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the Suleymaniye
Mosque).  While passing through Kucuk Pazar, we turned into one particularly
poorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in near
total darkness.  (I could only tell they were smoking by the occasional
flare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes.)  After first not
knowing what in the world we'd stumbled onto, I realized we were passing
near a hamam (Turkish public bath) -- no doubt an immensely important
institution in Kucuk Pazar, as many of the apartments there (I have been
told) have no showers.

Notwithstanding these, and a few other nonstarters, I still think Misha and
Nina's trip was a success.  We did and saw a lot, albiet while suffering
through the hot, humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer.  Probably of most
significance, to me, was checking in with Misha after nearly nine months
apart.  We had much to talk about, or at least to allude to vaguely.  During
one of our more memorable (i.e. ridiculous) jaunts into these wordy
never-never lands (which occurred on the roof porch of my building and
lasted until four in the morning), Misha was patient and courteous when I
suggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood space
between an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self.
Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understand
department.  In response, I referred to some of the books I've read.

This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons, though I plan on
studying Turkish a lot; for example, translating newspaper articles and
writing and, with the help of Ismail and Sukran, trying to absorb more
deeply all that I have learned to date.  And I have learned a lot, including
an incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary.  Still, I wonder if this old
dog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where to
lay down afterwards.  My biggest problem -- among many, I know -- is
""hearing"" Turkish.  (My two most used sentences are ""Ne dediniz [What did
you say]?"" and ""Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz [Can you say that again]?"".)  I
will be buying a television (ugh!), as I've concluded that a television is
an important way to learn how to ""hear"" Turkish.

Most importantly, this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writing
program, writing for a least three hours a day, five days a week.
(""Insallah [With god's help]."")  That, coupled with work and Turkish (and my
reading), should keep me pretty busy and, hopefully, productive.  At least I
should be sending a few more e-mails.

More later.

I am currently on vacation and unable to deliver this in person.  However, as PRC approaches I thought it would be useful to forward to you a few of my accomplishments thus far in 2001 besides being able to take vacation:
 
1.  EIM has overachieved its income targets for the first half of the year and is on track to overachieve the entire year.
 
2..  We have built a recurring commodity based wholesale business in forest products and steel that has many years to run with significant growth opportunities.
 
3.  Learning from other start up business units, we are building EIM at a reasoned pace and ensuring that costs appropriately reflect profit opportunites.
 
4.  EIM enters its second year of existence and its second year of profitability.
 
5.  We have made a significant impact on the two industries and remain the topic of conversation in most industry circles.
 
6.  EIM has successfully built a coordinated team effort and has successfully redeployed many key Enron personnel into value creation positions.
 
7.  Having made an impact in N America, the European team is under construction and is expected to be profitable by the end of the year, its first year of existence.
 
8.  I am the executive lead on the Vanderbilt recruiting effort and since my involvement, Vanderbilt is the most successful school we recruit from (cost per student and percentage of acceptances).
 
9.  I remain extremely involved in the mentor program and meet with my mentee of 3 years regularly.  In spite of my advice, he still seems to be progressing within the company!
 
10.  I believe I communicate the necessary information to senior management without burdening you with trivial details to utilize your time effectively.

Hello Jeffrey,
I came across your company information as I was conducting research on the Dallas Business Journal website. The article mentioned that Enron was moving into an office complex in Frisco, TX and could potentially employ up to 100 employees. 
I have recently been laid off as a contract/corporate recruiter with Nortel Networks and am interested in pursuing opportunities with Enron as you grow into your new Frisco location. By bringing my recruiting skills and background in-house as a contract or corporate recruiter, Enron can save thousands of dollars in potential external headhunter fees.
"
2875,"Got the list and will begin contacting/meeting with recommended individuals 
immediately.

Summary on the Legal opinion is essentially the following:
 
As long as no public funds are utilized to provide support to the search 
committee and/or its efforts, information obtained/compiled by the committee 
is not considered public information. However, any documented information 
that I or the committee exchange with the City is considered public 
information. The City may provide support to the committee only to facilitate 
the committee's contact with the persons or groups that will provide input. 

City has agreed with recommendation of placement of Advertisement with the 
International Association of Fire Chiefs and it is now due to appear in the 
Classified section of the next issue (Feb. 1 distribution and web posting) of 
International Fire Chiefs' ""On Scene"" magazine.

2876,"Attendees:

AT&T:  David Dorman,  President of AT&T (bio points below)

Enron:  Jeff Skilling, Stewart Seeligson, David Cox

Adventis: Partha Ghosh, Andy Belt and Mark Bruneau (via telephone)


Background:

As you well know, over the last 9 months EBS has made substantial efforts to 
establish a significant commercial relationship with AT&T.  Thus far, there 
have been no transactions between EBS and AT&T other than a couple dozen of 
circuit purchases by us mostly local loop.  Previously, our primary senior 
point of contact with AT&T has been Frank Ianna (President of Network 
Services).  It is probable that Ianna brought only the typical legacy 
perspective which prevented him from seeing how we could facilitate the AT&T 
business from a wholesale relationship.  They seemed to only want to sell us 
services.

Adventis advises us that Ianna now reports to David Dorman and that Dorman 
should be able to better understand the value that EBS can bring to further 
his business objectives.  It is my understanding that it will only be Dorman 
at the meeting (he is supposedly not bringing Ianna).  I view this meeting as 
a worthwhile shot to see if it is worth pursuing AT&T at all for the balance 
of the year for a big transaction.  Dorman's positive receptability to us is 
the only reason I can see to spend significant resources on AT&T in the near 
future.


EBS - AT&T History

Jun 2000 EES sponsored Executive Briefing with focus on EES and EBS - 
attendants include Frank Ianna from AT&T.

Oct 2000 - Extensive EBS team meets with extensive AT&T team to set up eight 
tactical and strategic working teams to find opportunities for the   
companies to build a bilateral commercial relationship.  After three weeks, 
results were presented to executive committee of both teams. Nothing 
materializes.

Potential Opportunities

AT&T currently spends a significant amount each year (expected to be in the 
$100s of millions) on offnet services (wholesale expenses) .  EBS would like 
AT&T to allocate a potion of the purchases towards EBS.

Adventis states there are currently numerous major undertakings by AT&T which 
are transforming the telecommunications operations at AT&T.  Is there not 
something EBS could do to help advance these undertakings?

At a minimum we would like AT&T to interconnect to our pooling points.


Final Note

I do not think we should lead with trading.  We should lead with our ability 
to provide services to the wholesale sector of the industry. The typical 
reaction we get from incumbent players is that if they don't trade or if they 
think that trading puts downward pressure on prices, then they should not do 
business with Enron.  They need to understand that they don't need to trade 
to have a valuable business relationship with  Enron

Blockbuster has had several meetings with Universal to obtain rights to 
content for the video on demand (VOD) offering.  Blockbuster has proposed an 
agreement to license product for both VHS/DVD rentals and the video on demand 
offering.

The negotiations have stalled because Universal has not been willing to sign 
any long-term agreements without Vivendi's support.

Blockbuster has refused to renew their agreement with Universal for VHS/DVD 
rentals until Universal agrees to grant digital VOD rights.  This will be 
detrimental to both parties.

2883,"Hello Jeff, the purpose for this message is to bring attention to
my firm, SDL International.   Big admirer of what Enron and you
 have done in the broadband sector and would like to prove the
value of my firm to Enron.   SDL is by far, one of the largest, market
leaders in the Globalization industry for Fortune 500 companies
who must have a global presence via the web to their targeted
customers.   SDL is based in the UK, (US HQ in Plano, TX), with
offices in over 26 countries and employing over 730.   We are
publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange, been in business
for  10 years and the only vendor in this space that is profitable.

I'd like to speak with you or a direct report about the potential of
working with Enron for your globalization needs.    Certainly
you  understand the extreme difficulties and expense you may face in
maintaining consistent content and branding across your multiple,
multi-lingual websites.  SDL is a leading globalization infrastructure and
services firm that can streamline those issues while positively impacting
the bottom line.  Our services span from Internationalization (both web
and software), technology (Webflow and ETS), professional services and
worldwide translation services, all developed and orchestrated to work
as a single, seamless effort.    Surely Enron handles alot of this already
but could the current process be made more cost effective as well
as expediting or increasing international revenue from foreign
markets?

SDL also offers ETS, a real time translation product that allows for
instant, multi lingual messaging, email, web based customer support,
etc... Product currently has a significant installed base of clients, in
particular, a joint effort between EDS and the FAA for global emails to
pilots and airports, as well as being used at Lucent as an internal
communications tool.    Again, this type of technology would be use
solely for content/info. one would not normally localize or translate.
ETS Webflow, which will further seperate us from the other static in the
Globalization industry.

I look forward to any suggestions you may have on how and with whom to
proceed further with. Thanks again for your time and have a great day.

Regards,

Michael

energy purchases and management.  We have a 22 MW cogenerator, buy gas and
electricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an ever
growing campus with 8,000 students, as many employees, many computer
facilities and laboratories.  I'm sure that we can do it more efficiently

out-source some or all of these activities.  I would like to put them in
touch with someone at Enron.

"
2895,"Have been in Antakya for the last couple days.  Will leave tomorrow.  Might
spend a night in Iskenderun on the coast, or might head back to Istanbul via
Ankara (where I hope to spend a day) by train.

Antakya formally named Antioch, of great import to Christian history.  (If
you look on  a map, I'm in the that finger of land that extends down from
Turkey between Syria and the Mediterranean.)  Not much in the town of great
beauty; mostly just modern, cement based, instantly aged, utilitarian styled
buildings.  Things stitched together, rickety, somewhat polluted.  The town,
however, surrounded by impressive mountains.  Have met a young Arab man, who
has shown me around (saw some spectacular thousand year old ruins (build by
Christians; destroyed by Muslims) on top of a mountain not far from here,
from which vantage point we could look out over the Mediterranean (and a
setting sun) and also to the south at a snow capped mountain that stood
between us and nearby Syria).  Last night joined him and his friends.  We
ate this heavenly kebab wrapped in thin, fried (in olive oil) unleaven bread
(the whole thing called Durum), then I watched as they played a card game
akin to Bridge.  (Did you know that Bridge was invented in Istanbul some 150
years ago by a few British soldiers stationed there during the Crimean War?
The name came from the fact they crossed the Galata Bridge [not far from my
place] each evening.  [Florence Nightingale (sp?) also stationed in Istanbul
during that same war, which was when she made her name.]) Two of the players
were Christian, one was Turk and the fourth my ""new"" Arab friend.  This
provence, Hatay, is apparently the most diverse one here in Turkey, in an
ethnic, cultural, religious sense.

Boat ride over from Cyprus an ordeal.  Seas rough.  Took twice as long (4
hours instead of 2) as advertized.  I got worried when the stewards passed
out small plastic bags as we left port.  I lasted about an hour and a half
before I used mine, but was part of a vast majority of fellow suffers.  I
guess I didn't inherent sea legs for my old man.

More later,

Love,

Mark

building(through tunnels that lead under the Mall from the various office
buildings to the Capital building) where I saw a few hours of a
Congressional debate on one of the many campaign reform bills that have
passed through those (not so hallowed?) halls.  The debate very interesting,
not the least reason being that it was made before only a couple dozen of
the 500 or so congresspeople (the rest, I was told, were monitoring the
debate on TVs in their offices).  At the few times that a quorum of the
members actually have to be present (for, say, an impeachment vote), a bell
rings and congresspeople hustle through the above mentioned tunnels to
register their vote, after which they hustle back.  It's something to see.
Good luck with the application.

YOU MUST, while in DC, see the Holocaust Museum.  I Mean MUST.  Should make
reservation (probably can use the Internet), as I understand it's booked up
far in advance.  The museum's right off the Mall so is conveniently located.
  The most powerful museum I've ever been too.

Turkish course finishes in two weeks.  Then to Israel during first week of
April, to Italy during second week.

Bursa was very impressive.  Not nearly as dilapidated as (most of) Istanbul.
  Was the first capital of the Ottoman Empire, so there are important
historical buildings from, among other centuries, the 13th.  Now, a bit of a
sprawl, and industrial. The city center sits at the bottom of the slope of a
huge mountain (its ragged, snowcapped peak breaking out of the clouds
periodically), and thus there are fine views in both directions.

More later,

Love,

Mark

Dear Mr. Skilling: 

As part of CERAWeek 2001, you are cordially invited to participate in the 
Leadership Circle, an exclusive program for senior executives to be held in 
Houston, Texas, February 11-16, 2001, in conjunction with CERAWeek 2001 and 
our 20th annual Executive Conference. 

The Leadership Circle has become a highlight of our annual conference, 
bringing together a very high-level, select group of government ministers and 
energy decision makers for informal discussions as well as substantive 
presentations on issues of common concern.

Our focus this year is energy market turmoil and its effect on investment 
strategies, regulatory backlash, and industry structure.? We will also 
discuss the postelection prospects for the economy and US politics. Note that 
we have extended the program in response to member suggestions and have 
included recreational activities on Sunday, February 11, and a reception that 
evening at the unique Paraiso Maravilla in Houston, as well as a special 
Summit on Energy Supply and Investment on Monday morning.

To view the complete program, and for details on sponsorship and 
registration, please visit our web site at 
http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/mc.cfm?p=674&c=22418. Please reserve your place 
at Leadership Circle 2001 by returning a completed registration form, which 
can be found at http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/mc.cfm?p=785&c=22418, or by

2898,"Dear Mr. Skilling,

You and I met last April when you spoke at a Rice Alliance event, and you
were quite kind to follow-up my request for a meeting with some Enron
contacts.  I'd appreciate your assistance again.

This week I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Lay  at the GasTech conference
at the George R. Brown while I was the guest of the Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Energy. During the meeting and subsequent luncheon address, I
was amazed to hear some of the facts about how Enron has 're-invented'
itself  through the power of eBusiness, coupled with a culture anxious to
embrace change.  As I recall, statistics like 70% of today's revenues from
businesses started in the last 10 years.

The  Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) is the industry's largest event
and recently has drawn close to 50,000 participates. The General Session is
the biggest draw at the conference, and for 2001 the topic will be how
eBusiness is transforming the industry. Each of our panel members will have
5 - 7 minutes to share their own company's story then we will move into a
panel discussion mode where we will discuss the future of eBiz in the
industry, barriers to adoption and potential benefits. The following leaders
have accepted our invitation;

1) Theirry Pilenko Schlumberger-GeoQuest, President

2) Bob Peebler  Halliburton, VP of e-Business Strategy and Ventures

3) Steve Peacock  BP, VP of Digital Business


4) Linda Sarandrea PetroCosm, VP of Global Hub Operations

5) Michael LaMotte Bank of America, Managing Director

I WOULD BE DELIGHTED IF YOU WOULD JOIN OUR PANEL. Enron has obviously moved
well beyond petroleum into a number of exciting areas. As I gather, much of
your company's success can be traced to it's leadership, it's culture and
eBusiness tools. Your insights and comments would be very helpful for our
audience, as well as perhaps our other panel members. The event should be
well covered by local and national press.

Shortly we will begin our promotional campaign and would like to include you
as a distinguished member of the panel. Please advise of your interest and
availability.

regards

Art J. Schroeder, Jr.

2904,"As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

We are in the process of negotiating an ISDA with this counterparty which is 
a German Bank and is not a Multibranch Party.  We just received their 
comments to our ISDA Schedule and they raised the following tax issues:

1. They have deleted the Section 3(f) rep in our Schedule and inserted 
""none"". 

2. In our tax forms section, they have deleted our language and added 
language that only requires them to give to us a Form 4224 in connection with 
payments received by them under the ISDA that are attributable to the conduct 
of a business in the US.

3. They have modified the definition of ""Indemnifiable Tax"" to include taxes 
imposed as a result of a Change in Tax Law by an authority in the 
jurisdiction of the payee, unless the payor is located in such jurisdiction .

I will send you their mark-up but I need your advice on how to handle these

Here are my comments to the form of Guranty:

1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement.

2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M 
if the Guaranty only covers Engage US.

3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our 
rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that 
is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only 
be on the Guarantor's right to assign.

4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent.

2943,"Just a reminder when drafting any documents that refer to EES's load:  there are over 17,000 meters associated with this load and any estimates of projected load are based upon incomplete data and a fair amount of guess work.  Tim Coffing has significantly improved this process; however, it is my understanding that we do not have, even at this time, a 100% accurate picture of historic usage, much less precise forecasts.  Therefore, I strongly suggest liberal use of the word approximate when referring to Enron's California load.

The CA ISO has received a number of calls from Market Participants asking to
review the confidential attachments to the CA ISO/EOB's March 1 motion
requested recently from FERC pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act
(request attached).  Market Participants argue that they require access to
the attachments in order to respond to the FOIA request.  The March 1 motion
requested confidential treatment for the attachments ""although the ISO and
the EOB do not believe that confidential treatment is required under the ISO
Tariff"" because they were nonetheless ""concerned that release of the
information contained in the appendices at this time could adversely affect
the ngotiations currently underway between the State of California and the
generators"".  Since these concerns exist, the CA ISO cannot release the
confidential appendices.  Attached however are the cover sheets to each
table which describe in detail what is contained in each table.  This
information should assist Market Participants interested in the matter to
prepare any response they may wish to submit to FERC.  Again, Market
Participants should not rely on the CA ISO to make their arguments for them.

2959,"TCPL and the Stakeholders have been meeting regularly since January and are 
close to a partial two year toll settlement along the following lines 
acceptable to TCPL:

Cost of Capital and ROE - to be litigated in NEB Rate Hearing
Operations, Maintenance and Administration Costs - 2001 = $223M    2002 = 
$216.5M
Depreciation - 2001 2.76% (increase of 0.1%)   2002 = 2.91%  (approx $60M 
over two years)
Authorized Overrun Service of 2.5% of FT credited to IT services
Employee Severance costs amortized over 3 years
Revenue Sharing to be capped at $5M
New Services to be tariffed and run through expedited Tolls Task Force 
Process.  If opposed at TTF, sponsors can file application with NEB.
IT Floor = greater of 80% of FT toll or sum of incremental marginal fuel cost 
pus FT Commodity toll plus 5% of daily FT demand toll
STFT - status quo
AECO/ANR Storage - TCPL commitment to review monetization and disposition 
options on 8 bcf this year

In terms of an Eastern Zone toll and prior to taking into account any 
increase for higher cost of capital, this represents about CDN$1.10/GJ in 
2001 and $1.15 in 2002 (assuming discretionary revenue of $40M/year).

Going around the table most stakeholders, including the LDCs and CAPP gave it 
unenthusiastic support although IGUA and Centra Man indicated they have 
strong problems with AOS if it is run as a credit to IT services.  El Paso 
and PGE were non-commital and may end up opposed.  Representing Enron, I 
expressed concern about the lack of clarity around what marginal fuel costs 
mean but indicated we would unlikely to be opposed (i.e prepared to litigate) 
if it was otherwise widely supported.

TCPL is to draft agreement language for distribution next week.

Per our Rhonda, can you tell him that deal 553645 should be changed Allegheny

Also, can you let the schedulers know about the name change of this deal.

"
2992,"I talked to Bill Williams and told him a quick (but not always perfect) way 
to see if it is the correct CP is to select the CP and then click on the Deal 
Clearing tab.  If there is a contract there or if you click on the arrow and 
a number is there, we have a K with that entity and it is the correct CP.  If 
it is blank under Global Contracts even after you click on the arrow, we do 
not have a contract with that entity and you have probably chosen the wrong 
CP.  I will also send him a list of entities we have Ks with, but he did not 
want them to have to look at a list.  Its probably a learning curve but at 
least this is a step in the right direction.  Let me know if you can think of 
other ways to help them.

ISSUE 1-Mike Swerzbin
deal 524248 and deal 524266
This two deals checkout with Amerex fine.  Amerex has one deal at 50 mw and 
we have two identical deals at 25 mw.

deal 524247
This deal checks out with Amerex fine.

The deal that I am missing is Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 
Q3'01 at $285.95.


ISSUE 2- Mike Swerzbin
deal 524267
 Amerex has 50 mw and we have 25 mw.

ISSUE 3- Dianna Scholtes
deal 523984
Amerex has price as $345 and we have price as $335.


This has been a terrible ordeal and I will be so glad when everthing is 
resolved!!!

"
3009,"Just wanted to give you an update on my progress so far - I'm changing these 
deals in between each of my other daily tasks, and I'm also having a hard 
time reading some of the deal numbers. I've made it through the first page 
and a bit of the second. I've changed all but four of the deals to ""no 
confirm."" Here are the questions I have on those deals:

1. 552516 - why are we not confirming a City of Riverside deal? Should I ask 
Jeff?

2. 553037 - looks like it's already ""no confirm""

3. 553666/667/668 - are we not confirming any deals where PGE is the 
counterparty? I thought it was just where PGE System was the delivery point?

4. 553926 - this deal is killed. Do we have to change settings on killed 
deals as well?

Also, if you have a slightly bigger copy of the document you faxed over, or 
if you could e-mail it to me, that would save me a lot of guessing time. 
Thanks for your help!

volumes on the new CARP report.

Kate"
3012,"Kate,

I am glad you like ""Hidden Order,"" I think it is one of the few non sedating
economics books out there.  The reason I like this book is because, more
than any other, it tries to show you how economists think -- done mostly
through stories.  As I am sure you've notice, this is not a textbook.
Introductory economics textbooks are usually structured as if every student
were going on to acquire a Ph.D. in the subject.  In this course more
emphasis is on building up your intuition rather than in more technical
aspects of economic theory.  I hope you will find it enjoyable.

Being an assistant commodity trader I sure you have more practical
experience with economics than any of the other students ( and me).

It sounds like you are doing well and I cannot think of anything that you
might be missing.

Feel free to send me any questions about the reading, notes or homework,

Scott

For those of you who are not already familiar with Enron Broadband's 
arrangement with US Suites, please know that ENA also falls under their 
contract for corporate housing rates.  Guests have no minimum requirement for 
their stay, though after 29 days, they are eligible for a lower rate.  The 
rate for 1-29 days is $95 and 30+ days is $73.50.  Any Enron employee or 
guest of Enron may receive these rates.  They may also pay with their own 
credit card.  Most locations have a washer and dryer in unit, among other 
fantastic amenities.   There are several locations in Portland including the 
""Village at Lovejoy Fountain"" 245 SW Lincoln, ""Southpark Square"" 1511 SW Park 
Ave., and ""Portland Center Apartments"" 111/222/255 SW Harrison.  Please see 
Jessica or myself to view a brochure.  Other locations outside of Portland, 
such as Boise, Seattle and Albuquerque (among others), are also available.  
Call 503.620.8593 to reserve a room.

 You may also contact Cammie Lint, Account Executive with US Suites, at

3025,"Whatever she's making now is not enough. Vickie Aldous went above and beyond 
the call of duty, not only locating, copying and expediting the article to 
me, but all within two days of my request. And it was for a good cause - 
we'll be donating the proceeds from our holiday party/auction to the 
Court-Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). Last year the proceeds went to 
Emanuel Children's Hospital - $20,000 from auction attendees plus matching 
dollars from Enron Corp. resulted in a hefty check.

I'm sorry we didn't connect while you were in Portland. I got the message on 
Monday and figured it was a little too late by then. Hope the reunion went 
well. I'm scrambling to be svelte and successful by my 10-year high school 
reunion, which descends upon me in less than four years. I know I'll need at 
least that much time, having spent four years of my life with that bunch of 
overachieving Catholic girls.

I just had a surprise visit from some Ashland friends on Tuesday, replete 
with an extra ticket to see Santana at the Rose Garden. What an awesome 
concert! I must say I'm thoroughly enjoying city life again. But I'll need to 
come to Ashland soon for a dose of good old-fashioned familiarity.

So, I guess this was the long way of saying yes, I got the article, and thank 
you so much for such indispensible help.

"
3038,"I'm not sure which ""process"" you are referring to.  I have not yet seen a 
list of proposed reference entities and if any of them have a business 
relationship with Enron they will need to be subject to a deeper legal 
review.  The process for that review has not yet been finalized but for some 
potential reference entitiesit will be very time consuming (i.e. for those 
entities where the extent and nature of the business relationship is 
unclear).  The ""soft"" Chinese walls also have yet to be built for the US.  
For those walls to be effective there may need top be training for people on 
both sides of the walls.

Top stories this week: 
_________________________ 

At this year's International Swaps and Derivatives Association
meeting, which drew the largest crowd ever, Internet and e-commerce
issues were on everybody's mind and crept into most presentations
and discussions. 

Leading U.S. banking agencies have proposed changes to their
risk-based capital rules to address the exposure of banks, bank holding
companies? and thrifts to credit risk. The paper proposes, among other
things, that credit derivatives be included in the definitions of credit risk
arising from securitizations and that the capital charge be based on the
credit rating of the underlying obligation. 

Merrill Lynch is reorganizing its global debt group and recently appointed
Dow Kim to a new position as head of the newly formed integrated global
enterprise solutions group. The move is meant to integrate the bank's
previously less centralized derivatives businesses. 

Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction Co., the South Korea ship
building and construction giant, is considering its first use of U.S.
dollar/Korean won currency options and interest-rate swaps.

3043,"Pets In the Office
 It's A Growing Trend

 In the dog-eat-dog world of business, there's a growing trend at some 
companies. Workers are bringing their
 pets to the office. 

 Chip Paucek, who produces educational videos and television programs, has 
been taking his golden retriever,
 Hoss, to work for the last five years. Paucek and Hoss visited The Early 
Show and talked with Co-Anchor
 Jane Clayson. 

 The dog has became the office mascot, says Paucek. ""He brings a lot of 
emotion and people love it. He's
 very relaxed."" 

 But Paucek, as co-president of his company, has the freedom to bring Hoss to 
the office if he wishes. Not
 everybody can bring their pet to work. 

 ""A lot of it depends on the dog,"" says Paucek, who explains that Hoss is not 
a rowdy dog. 

 ""He just hangs out,"" explains Paucek. ""He's easy to get along with."" 

 Hoss has free rein at the office. When Paucek is away on trips, ""My wife 
brings him in and drops him off at
 the office,"" Paucek says. 

 While there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace, there are also 
many legal issues to consider. John
 Challenger, CEO of an international placement company, agrees that the trend 
of bringing pets to the work
 place is really growing. 

 ""More and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their 
working place
 employee-friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace,"" 
says Challenger 

 He points out, however, that there are serious issues that employers and 
employees need to explore before
 they adopt a pets-in-the-office policy. 

 ""One of the things that the companies must do, before they jump into a 
policy like that, is take a poll
 of their employees and find out what they're thinking. If you have certain 
employees that don't feel
 comfortable with pets, you might want to rethink the policy."" 

 There are liability questions as well. For example, the company might be 
liable if a dog or cat bites or
 scratches another employee. 

 ""The company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of 
policy in effect,"" says
 Challenger. ""The employee needs to understand that if their dog bites 
someone or the cat scratches
 someone, it can't be the company's fault."" 

 Allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office. 

 ""Many people are allergic to cat hair. You have to think, as an employer, 
will you put them in a
 certain part of your space. What about people who are afraid of animals? 
Many don't feel
 comfortable with them around. Just how many do you want? Do you want cats 
and dogs and what
 about birds? What about the noise of birds?"" 

 Paucek admits that when there's more than one pet in the office, ""It gets 
chaotic."" 

 In 1997, the American Animal Hospital Association surveyed 1,225 pet owners. 
They found that: 

      21% of those surveyed had taken their pets to work 
      76% feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they're on the 
job 
      33% said they leave a TV or radio on for their animals


 If a company decides to allow pets in the office, they should: 

      poll employees before they let the pets come 
      provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome 
in the office 
      establish an off-limits-to-pets area 
      make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated 
      bar noisy, destructive, or messy animals from the office 
      tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times


 If many employees want to bring their pets to the office, the company should 
make a rotating schedule. 

 When the pets-in-the-office policy does work, it's great. Paucek says when 
he and Hoss arrive at work, ""I get
 off the elevator. He goes one way and I go the other. He says hello to the 
employees. He has his own
 web page."""

I understand that you oversee the legal issues/contracts relating to our 
financial trading activities and consequently was hoping you might be able to 
assist us in regard to the following query that relates to sourcing data from 
external financial information providers.

I work in EnronCredit.com as a Telecommunication analyst and am interested in 
accessing the above information source which is provided by Thomson 
Financial.  FYI, ""FirstCall"" allows online realtime access to a wide variety 
of debt and equity focused investment house/broker reports.

We originally had access via a trial that was apparently initiated by a ""C. 
Weber"" who was based out of Houston but who has subsequently left the company.

Unfortunately, access to this service has been withdrawn by Thomson Financial 
here in London on the basis that we are a ""corporate"" and not a ""financial"" 
or ""fund manager"".  Thomson Financial are now offering us a reduced 
time-delayed service (""Investex"") which is not sufficient for our needs and 
consequently we would like to reestablish the FirstCall service or a service 
providing similar or superior functionality.

Prior to meeting with Thomson, I would very grateful if you could enlighten 
us on any of the following:

- Whether Enron has any relationship and/or agreements in place with Thomson 
Financial in the US;
- If the latter is the case, which services we receive from this data 
supplier;
- If this is not the case, which alternative but similar data services we do 
receive.

I believe that if we can establish that we already receive the FirstCall 
service in the US it would greatly strengthen our case for receiving it here 
in the UK.  Alternatively, if we do not receive this service in the US it 
would be extremely valuable for us to know what alternative, but similar, 
sources of information are available, in order that we might have another 
option should Thomson Financial prove to be inflexible on the issue of 
supplying FristCall.

Should you have any queries in relation to any of the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me either by return or on the direct number below.

Thanks for your help with this.

3090,"Mark:  I scheduled a meeting with you at 4:30 pm today to discuss the MG 
acquisition, in particular, MG London, Inc. (a U.S REGULATED NYMEX clearing 
member, FCM, CTA).  NO ONE is looking into this from a US regulatory/legal 
perspective and I think it should be the swap group.  Enron's ""regulated"" 
product areas are metals (since MG clears its own trades on the NYMEX/COMEX 
and has FCM/CTA status) and potentially agriculture if we (some Enron entity) 
choose to become a regulated ""ATOM"" (ag trade option merchant).  From a legal 
perspective, I think we should have a ""whitepaper"" drafted by Sullivan & 
Cromwell, and, it should include an analysis of the MG London, Inc. existing 
situation.  This would tie into the ag regulation.  Also, have you thought 
about ENA and MG as NYMEX members and whether we keep both designations, 
whether we move all/part of ENA's existing clearing business to MG (and 
perhaps eliminate the need for margin/brokering arrangements such as Paribas, 
etc.) and any other related issues?  For efficiency purposes, Donna Lowry has 
asked to join us.  Donna and I had a conference call this morning with 
Justin, Paul, Jon Barrett, Sheila Glover and Trena McFarland to figure out 
who's on first (with MG).

Also, I am attaching an update of my workload.  I have reached the breaking 
point and I need more help (even with Jason's help on brokerage agreements 
the new electronic trading platform agreements are reaching multiple 
proportions with a new request for agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and 
EnronCredit.com London).  Gareth and Craig Clark want to meet today about the 
prepay (Delta/Citibank) and I REALLY need help on the Global Finance side.

See you later.  Sara

3091,"Mark,

Per my voice mail, I would be very grateful if you or someone in your department could give this confirmation letter a quick review before lunch.  The intent of the deal is that we will pay Deseret a fixed price in exchange for a floating price based on the DJ-PV index.  However, if Deseret's plant goes down, then both parties will suspend payments the day following the unit outage, and resume payments once the unit comes back online.  If the index turns out to be greater than our fixed payment, we will pay Deseret  50% of the delta between the index and the fixed price.  

Please call or e-mail me with your comments.  My number is (503) 464-7795.

Thanks so much,

Steve

Hey Team!

Attached is a ""Draft"" Event Sheet for the LSU presentation, scheduled for Thursday, October 18th.

The only thing pending on the event sheet is the Reception location at Mike Anderson's.  I have left a message for David Morris regarding availability for 30/40 attendees.  As soon as I confirm with Mike Anderson's I'll send a final version of the event sheet.

If you have any question, I can be reached at 713/ 345-7344.

 
Joe/Jeff, 

Let me know if you're interested in taking the interns (that were extended full time offers) out to dinner.
"
3102,"Other than the auto download portion, the SO2 Report program is just about wrapped up.  I have completed correcting the numbers for the Ending Position and the Total Market Balance Chart.  All numbers now correctly add up .  It would probably work out best if you guys could download/unzip the EPA files yourself until the auto download portion is completed.  If needed,
I can show you guys what it would entail.

Attached is the latest copy.  As usual just copy this file to C:\Program Files\SO2Report

 

Thanks

Sorry for the delay in catching up with my e-mails. Yes, MG London Inc is the 
clearing member of NYMEX/COMEX and is FCM & CTA. The only other MG companies 
who have any exchange/regulatory registrations are in the UK and are 
Metallgesellschaft Ltd (LME & SFA, also LIFFE to come), MG Brokers Ltd (LME &

"
3106,"1.  Attached to the forwarded e-mail below please find a link to the demo for 
the Five Flags Game.  Please note that this is still a work in progress.  We 
still need to prepare the ""How to Play"" section, for example.  Let me assure 
you that this Section and no other section in the game will include the term 
""Olympics"" or any of the other protected terms that we have been advised to 
avoid from the various jurisdictions.  The front page of the game will 
include an express disclaimer to the effect of the following:  ""The Enron 
Five Flags Down Under game has not been set up in collaboration with any 
parties, other than Internet Sports Network, Inc.""

2.  I have attached a draft of the Official Rules for your review. The front 
page of the game will make clear that by electing to play the game, a 
participant acknowledges and agrees to be bound by the Official Rules.  
Please note that the rules make clear that only residents of certain 
specified jurisdictions are entitled to play.  The rules spell out that 
residents of Japan are entitled to play but are not eligible to receive 
prizes in excess of 100,000 yen.  Anne, please confirm that it is permissible 
for us to allow Japanese residence to play and to merely limit their 
eligibility for prize awards.  (There will be prizes available that are 
valued at approx. $5000-$10,000 USD, but if a Japanese resident won the grand 
prize, he/she would not be awarded such a prize.  Instead, in such a 
circumstance, a Japanese winner probably would be awarded one of the 
consolation prizes instead.)



3.  The game will not be promoted with fliers or other hard-copy marketing 
materials, after all.  Instead, the game will be promoted on the 
password-protected Trading Screen of EnronOnline.  (The game will NOT be 
promoted on the home page.)  All registered users of EnronOnline will be able 
to see the front page of the game, including residents of Canada, Australia, 
and any European country where participation in the game is prohibited.  

4.  The following disclaimer will be included (1) next to the initial 
hyperlink to the game on the EnronOnline website (to confirm that this is 
possible; (2) on the front page of the game; and (3) on the registration 
page.  ""This game is only available to residents of A, B and C.  Furthermore, 
due to the operation of the law in Japan, we will be unable to award prizes 
whose value exceeds 100,000 Yen to Japanese residents.""  The registration 
page will include a gating function that requires the participant to enter 
his/her country of residence or principal place of business.  PLEASE ADVISE 
AS TO NECESSARY FORM OF QUESTION -- e.g., country of residence vs. country 
where business with Enron is conducted  If the country selected is not an 
eligible jurisdiction, the participant will receive a message that he/she is 
ineligible to play the game due to regulatory restrictions in his/her country 
of residence and will not be able to play the game.

Rachel and Marly:  I need to finalize the list of eligible jurisdictions as 
soon as possible.  Here's what I have so far:

USA, excluding NY and Florida (Milbank is advising on US issues)
UK
Germany
Switzerland
Poland 
Austria.

I thought that Portugal was also in the ""approved"" category.  Please advise 
as to the status of Portugal, as well as other jurisdictions where we are 
awaiting approval.  If the demo is not sufficiently complete to facilitate 
the approval process, please notify Dave Samuels so that he can work with the 
developer to create a more substantially complete demo.

5.  From the Canadian and Australian perspective, I merely want to confirm 
that our disclaimer in (4) above is sufficient to protect Enron from 
liability in Canada and Australia, as applicable, to gaming laws.

I will be in the office through the morning of Tuesday, Aug. 29.  Thereafter, 
through September 9, I will be on vacation.  Mark Taylor will be finalizaing 
all matters relating to the game in my absence.  (His e-mail address is

3107,"When you're done with that agreement can you pass it back to me for the 
file.  Thanks."
3108,"Mark and Leslie, 

Dave had mentioned that Mark had some reservations about using prize winners' 
names.

Could you please confirm weather we can or can not legally use prize winner 
names for promotional purposes and your rational for not wanting to disclose 
the winners.  

Cheers

Per my voice mail, I have left a message for Mark to give his input.

I think you should revise the letter as follows, subject to Mark's edits:

""Please be advised that effective July 17, 2000, MGplc was aquired by the 
Enron group. MG London Inc was part of the MGplc group.

Effective October 9, 2000, MG London Inc. changed its name to ""Enron Trading 
Services Inc"". 

Also, please be advised that the Financial Status of MG London Inc (now Enron 
Trading Services Inc.) has not changed.

In case we don't get a chance to talk, just some thoughts on chnages that mat 
need to be made to the ISDA Schedule:

1. Part 1 (b) - this is where we will specify the Threshold Amount for cross 
default to other debt (Section 5(a)(vi) purposes.  Please note that the 
definition of Specified Indebtedness in the ISDA is very narrow.  Let Mark 
Taylor know if that needs to be amended.  Alos, let Mark know if the cross 
default language itself needs to be amended to match the Supply Agreement.

2. Part 1 (h) - this section contemplates adding Additional Termination 
Events.  I had thought that here we would add a cross default to the 
Transaction Documents.  Mark will need input from you on what those are.  
Additionally, it would be here that we would add some of the other trigger 
events that are currently in the Supply Agreement.  Again, Mark will need 
your input on what those are.

3. Please look at the language in sections 5(a)(vii)(bankruptcy) and 
5(b)(iv)(credit event upon merger) of the ISDA form and advise Mark as to 
whether any changes need to be made to conform with what is in the Supply 
Agreement.

I'm assuming that the other parts of the schedule will be agreed to by them.  
Please note that in Part 1(e) we have chosen the ""Loss"" method as a means for 
calculating the termination payment.  In Part 3, these are the docs that we 
usually get but if the Supply Agreement requires something different, 
particularly with respect to financial info, we can modify accordingly.    In 
part 4, we have chosen arbitration and Texas as governing law.  Part 5 is 
mostly boilerplate, but note the ""setoff"" language and the ""transfer"" 
language, which they may comment on.  part 6 is boilerplate. 

Mark's number is 853-7459.  I'll be back Wednesday afternoon.

Union Oil's only issue relates to their concern about the long descriptions 
on the Website and how conflicts between terms used in such descriptions and 
terms that are defined in the Master are resolved.  Their attorney has 
already reviewed the long descriptions and is still not comfortable with the 
language in the ETA.  She would however be comfortable allowing the terms in 
the long description control if such terms are used in the confirmations that 
they receive for each trade.  Would this be an acceptable approach to take?

As we discussed, here is my list of amendments that are according to my 
records in various stages of negotiation:

1. Allegheny energy - Patricia Clark sent to Frank Davis her comments on June 
15th by e-mail.  I responded on June 19th and have never heard back from 
her.  Most of her comments we could not accept.  None of her comments have 
been run by Dave.

2. Imperial Oil -  Grant Oh was handling this.  They had 3 comments. most of 
which we could not accept.  I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and 
have never heard back from him.  None of their proposed changes have been run 
by Dave.

3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has 
approved was sent to them on May 15th.  My contact there is Jim Sobule  Wayne 
Gresham is alos involved in this.  I have never heard back from Jim. 

4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March.  
Tori Kuykendall and Grant Oh are involved from the Enron side.  I responded  
to David Dyck by e-mail on March 10th and have never heard anything further 
on this.  None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave.

5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick  on January 31st 
which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.  Dave 
has not reviewed their comments or my response.

6. Cargill - I sent to Mike Pederson a form of amendment letter which I don't 
think has been signed.  They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality 
language.  Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to 
life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it.

7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John 
Dirheimer on May 15th.   To my knowledge it has not been signed.

8. Duke Energy - I sent a draft amendment letter to John Puett on May 15th 
which Dave approved.  To my knowledge, it has not been signed.

9. Talisman - we have been exchanging drafts of a revised ETA for months.  My 
contact there is Ann Love.  We are close to reaching agreement with them and 
mark has been involved in some of the early discussions.  I am sending to 
Dave a mark-up of the revised agreement for his approval.


All of the ETA amendment letters and the Talisman revised ETA are in my

Right now the SCE QFs are negotiating with SCE on 2 major points:  when will they be paid for the outstanding receivables (est. at $1.3 B for SCE and about $1.0 B for PG&E)  and when will the 5 yr fixed price SRAC of 5.37 cents/kw apply for those that have selected this option.  Right now SCE appears to be indicating that they will be paying the receivable sometime around June/July of 2002 and that the 5.37 price would apply at that time or as much as 4 months after that.  The logic is that they are trying to indicate that the MOU, if it had been passed, would not have applied at least until that time.

you.
I hope Enron can get some of their ""creative juices"" going and figure out a 
way
that the City of Mesa can compliment their gas contract with their electric
needs.   I think there are some opportunities out there.

Kim, two things.  One regarding capacity releasing:  our billing determinant 
is
14,247 and we can release the difference of this number and what our load will
be.  Sorry, I just had to think about it after the meeting.  Also, regarding
this matter, one must consider the conditions of pre-arranged deals.  There 
are
some hurdles, but all ""doable"" once we get our thinking caps on.

Two, I did not realize that you were on the electric side for awhile.  I am in
somewhat of a ""learning mode"" regarding electric and was wondering if you 
could
just ""jam"" with me about the electric side.  I understand the concepts because
of my position on the gas side, but I want to learn the players and some
strategies.  Dave, I think you could teach me a thing or two also.

3172,"Dan, thanks.  I will review the contract changes later today or tomorrow.
And thank you for the response on the resolution.  I've heard that this item
will be presented to the council for adoption on March 12.  That's the
earliest date.  I will coordinate with our staff on other matters that need
attending to get this done.  Thanks for your help.  Grant Kolling.

  "
3173," <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

Dan:

First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City
Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has
reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional
changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions
about certain of its terms and conditions.

Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the
exhibits.

1.  There is the word ""DRAFT"" above the title of the Enfolio agreement which
should be deleted.

2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words ""1st of
January, 2001.""  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the
contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the
contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the
to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron
(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.
Therefore, the City requests the word ""may"" should be changed to ""shall.""

4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's Requested
Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the
Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.
How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's
Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a
Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?

5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to ""reasonable
attorneys' fees"" yet line 15 refers to ""attorneys' fees.""  To be internally
consistent, line 15 should say ""reasonable attorneys' fees.""

6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the
determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It's unclear
whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination
before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled to
receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is
obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the
City to exercise these rights.

7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a
bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under
bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek
dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section that
backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change ""30 days"" to ""5 days.""  The City
is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to
Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.
(ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?
Please explain.

10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is ""a Company"" supposed to refer to ""the Company""
?

11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision
as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event
(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the
60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California
law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We
don't understand it.

13.  Appendix ""1"":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?

14.  Appendix ""1"", Claims, line 4:  Please add ""reasonable"" before
""attorneys' fees.

 15.  Appendix ""1"", GAAP:  This should read: ""GAAP means generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and
governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,
with respect to Customer.""

16.  Appendix ""1"", Interest Rate:  Please delete ""two percent over"".  The
City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime
should not apply to it.

17.  Appendix ""1"", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the
City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,
what is ENA's bond rating?  Is ""BBB-"" an investment grade rating?

18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the
opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being
deleted.  But the ""Representations and Warranties"" is nevertheless included
in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not
undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an
opinion.  We would like to delete ""and (vii) it is not ... Party.""

19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add ""reasonable"" before
""attorneys' fees.""

20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by ""to the extent it has a
legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc.""

21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legal
policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enron
amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my
opinion.

22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include
a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on
behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to
this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.

Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I
hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for
response.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today
until Wednesday, March 7.

Sincerely,

Grant Kolling
  "
3174,"In that case, it's just the SoCalGas core procurement charge (including
brokerage fee -- e.g. their March price was $7.404/dth) that we need to be
comparable to or beat.  We have more control over the transmission rates so 
the
price from Enron we are looking for is just for the commodity at the border.
I'll provide you with our monthly WACOG that customers are charged as the
commodity portion of their bill versus SoCalGas' core procurement charge.  
I'll
be sending you the data today.

"
3175,"Tim,

Further to our discussion this morning, I have attached a draft of a term 
sheet regarding the development of generation at REU's Clear Creek site with 
the intent of marketing the output to DWR under a 3-6 year tolling agreement.


We think this summer will afford us a great opportunity to negotiate with DWR 
to obtain significant value substantially offsetting the installed cost of 
the unit.  To that end, we want to position ourselves so that we can move 
quickly should DWR make a strong bid for capacity and energy.  
Notwithstanding, we appreciate Redding's obligations regarding its load and 
think that there will be a lot of flexibility with DWR in structuring a 
transaction that meets everyone's needs.

If you are interested, we propose entering into an MOU that summarizes the 
general terms of the transaction and roles and responsibilities.  Let's talk 
after you have reviewed the attached term sheet.

Thanks for your time and interest regarding this opportunity.

Laird"
3176,"Term sheet looks fine.
As for gas pricing, it seems we'd be better off just settling per the
contract.
I'm OK with PG&E Topock, but I'm hopeful that either (i) it will prove to be
more valuable (closer to So Cal) in the future, or (ii) we can work with
PG&E to deliver it to So Cal somehow.

"
3177,"John/Sean:

I am a little confused on how the pricing indicated in your term sheet would 
work.  I think if we review the attached it will clarify things.  Please call 
me later to discuss.  I want to make sure we understand how the pricing would 
work for Griffith as well as Enron to Citizens.  

Also, I think the Commodity section of your proposal term sheet has some 
missing words.  You don't seem to be adding the spread value of interstate 
transport to the Commodity charge.  

I will be out for an hour.  Back at 1:00 Portland time.

"
3178,"Check Case 2, it seems like the gas cost to Enron could excced the floor 
price as we would be charging pipeline costs.  Isn't the floor San Juan plus 
$07 plus fixed plus variable pipeline cost plus fuel?

3186,"Kim,

We are responding to an RFP from the City of Riverside.  They are looking to install 40 MW of gas fired generation by January 1, 2002 (the actual installation date will probably be April 1, 2002) and require a gas supply.  Their expected capacity factor is only 15% however.  As such, they need a Gas Daily priced supply - up to 12,200 MMBtu/d - which they can call upon with short notice.

Can you provide me the pricing and terms under which ENA would provide this service?

1.  Can we deliver the gas to their plant-gate on SoCal's system?
2.  Would the gas be priced off Gas Daily at SoCal's border + as-billed transport to plant-gate?
3.  What notice period do we require to effect delivery?
4.  What index based price are we willing to do?  High end of the common range, etc...?

Have I missed anything?

The response is due April 18th.  Sorry for the short timeframe.

3187,"Kim -

A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip 
to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their 
website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not 
saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, 
but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's 
filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's 
obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, 
with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we 
definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?

I have sent the spreadsheets for May and June to Patti for her to look over before I send them to Pasadena.  I have not heard back from her yet.  You may be able to help, though.  Do you know the negotiated prices for the El Paso fixed capacity for May forward?  I need them to finish the calc sheets.  Patti was going to look them up for me, but she hasn't had a chance yet.  I have attached the May and June files in case you want to review them.   I need the price for the box highlighted in yellow on each sheet.

3191,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com."

We spoke last week about a possible 5 yr gas deal for our Yuba City plant.
Below is our RFP.  I'll call to discuss.

Thanks, Paul Cummins
916-996-2291 cell
916-447-5171 work

Request for Proposal (""RFP"")
Yuba City Cogeneration Partners, LP
650 Bercut Drive, Suite C
Sacramento, CA  95814


Background.  Yuba City Cogeneration Partners, LP (""YCC"") is the owner of a 49
megawatt cogeneration facility (""Facility"") in Yuba City, California.  YCC
sells its 49 megawatts to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (""PG&E""), an entity
that recently filed for bankruptcy protection.  YCC recently entered into a
five-year, fixed-price electricity agreement with PG&E, and YCC desires to
enter into a long-term Natural Gas Supply Agreement (""NGSA"") with an
appropriate supplier (""Seller"") of natural gas.  The NGSA shall be subject to
approval of the YCC project lenders, and YCC will only be able to enter into
the NGSA after bankruptcy court approval of the five-year, fixed-price
electricity agreement with PG&E. As a result, YCC will require a daily update
to proposals it receives (to account for varying market conditions) until it
receives all necessary approvals to enter into a final NGSA.

Term. The term sheet contemplates either a three-year natural gas supply
agreement or a five-year natural gas supply agreement.  Under either term,
the starting date will be tentatively August 1, 2001, subject to the
necessary approvals.

Point(s) of Delivery.  PG&E City Gate.

Annual Volumes.  For the purposes of this RFP, it is assumed that the
Facility will consume monthly and annual gas volumes under one of three
different operating scenarios:

    Scenario        Annual Volume, mmBtu

       1                1,210,000


The typical, historical daily usage at the Facility has been 6,000 mmBtu/day,
except periods of maintenance or reduction by the Facility due to the
satisfaction of capacity requirements under its power purchase agreement
(""PPA"") with PG&E, and the typical, monthly historical usage has been based
upon a Monday through Friday operation.  Scenario 1 is indicative of plant
operations for the satisfaction of the minimum requirements of the PPA,
essentially 80%.

YCC would prefer a NGSA that is based upon annual volumes in a rolling
12-month period.

Monthly Balancing.  Monthly balancing on the PG&E system shall be the
Seller's responsibility, subject to the limitations of the YCC's natural gas
transportation agreement with PG&E, and subject to the PG&E gas system rules
and tariffs.  Seller shall be responsible for any gas imbalance charges
incurred on the PG&E System.

Usage Estimates.  For the purpose of assisting Seller in the Nomination
process, YCC shall make usage estimates in advance and as usage occurs.
Seller should specify requested frequency of usage estimates.

Monthly True-Up.  Actual usage at the Facility will almost certainly be of
some variance to the forecasted monthly gas volumes.  Seller shall propose a
means of ""true-ing up"" the actual usage to the forecasted monthly volumes.
The ideal system of true-ing up would allow for flexibility to both YCC and
Seller (""the Parties"") under the following minimum circumstances:

1. True-up of variance between forecasted usage and actual, if any.

2. If gas price volatility has created daily or other market pricing that
creates financial incentive to the Parties to curtail deliveries to the
Facility and remarket the natural gas to the spot or other market.

3. Allowance for the Facility to curtail deliveries for planned or unplanned
maintenance.

Monthly true-up may incorporate resolution of the differences between price
and volume.

Day of Nomination.  The date of Nomination of daily gas volumes by the Seller
to the PG&E City Gate shall be at the option of, and as determined by Seller,
subject to the limitations of YCC's natural gas transportation agreement with
PG&E, and subject to the PG&E gas system rules and tariffs.

Maximum Daily Nomination Quantity:  YCC's natural gas transportation
agreement with PG&E allows for a maximum daily nomination quantity of 9,550
MMbtu/Day.

Price.  YCC seeks a NGSA that will provide a physical price hedge via three
alternative strategies.  The strategies are as follows:

Strategy        Price Hedge

       1            Fixed price for the term.
       2            Floating price, with a not-to-exceed cap.
       3            Floating price, with a minimum and maximum price.

YCC acknowledges that other hedging strategies exist and may be advisable for
the NGSA.  The Seller is encouraged to supply a proposal that incorporates
other strategies.

Credit and Payment Terms.  YCC can offer the following credit and payment
mechanisms for the purpose of removing credit and payment concern from the
Seller:

1. Semi-Monthly Payment. Semi-Monthly payment for gas based on expected
consumption over the first fifteen (15) calendar-day period of each month,
and the expected consumption over the balance of each month via a wire from

3218,"The differences we had on Friday were mainly volume related. Correcting the deal in SITARA and UNIFY relates to volume actualizations.  It is not pricing related. As we talked about there are still some issues on the redwood gas.  Redwood gas is the gas relating to the underdelivereis.  In otherwords, when Palo Alto ""Burns"" less than we actualy schedule on the transport.  Presumably we sell this gas to other 3rd parties, and Palo Alto will be reimbursed for the variable transportation.  I do not think ther are additional fees we would pay on top of reimburseing them for the variable costs, but I am not 100% certain.

Please let me know if ther are any other questions.

3224,"Hi Kim,

Yes.  Does this forecast account for the meter that is out?  The load data I
sent you last week for June 01 and July 01 is wrong.  One of the meters is
out and reflects zero usage for those months.  I believe you guys have
historical June and July usage for 1997 through 2000.  Let me know if you
need additional data.

We had talked about getting a forecast from you for months and months into
the future.

Also, I will fax you the baseload quantities for the month September 2001
this afternoon.

Call me if you have any questions.

Monica

"
3225,"Kim,
 The response to III P. should be Not Applicable, unless you are having 
someone obtain a Certificate of Good Standing from the State of California.  
 The response to III Q. should be that the Final Contract and Transaction 
Agreement will be signed by a Vice President of Enron North America Corp. and 
as agreed with the City's counsel, a Certificate of Incumbency shall be 
provided to verify that the person signing is an officer of the Company.
 The remainder of the document appears okay.  I was curious as to how you 
were going to respond to their statement regarding their potential purchase 
of interstate transportation assets and their request that we manage these 
assets for them.  Repricing should work.

 Call me if you have any further questions.

3241,"Please be advised that we successfully converted existing data and implemented the new contract/capacity release system for Transwestern last week.  With that, there is one change that will impact the Commercial group.  In the old CBS system, the Contract Admin group was responsible for identifying whether a contract was negotiated as a one-part or two-part rate.  Until a deal sheet is built and the new rates/revenue system is implemented, the Marketers will continue to update discounts in the existing CBS system under Negotiated Rates Maintenance.  

Additionally, the Marketer will be responsible for updating within the same rate maintenance screen the one-part/two-part flag for all new firm contracts under the 'reservation' charge code.  If a contract amendment requires a change to this indicator, this must also be captured; however, be advised that this field does not have effective dates.  Therefore, if the indicator is not applicable until a future date, the one-part/two-part flag cannot be updated because the current billing will pick up this change.  I will provide any additional training if necessary regarding the loading of rates/indicators.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

As a reminder, we have scheduled internal demos of the new system today at 1:30pm and 3pm as well as this Thursday at 1:30pm in EB3907.

I had not heard anything about a suprise party for Rich in Houston but regardless, with Red Rock, annual outages etc...  it would probably be a difficult time for me.  If I can help with anything please give me a yell.  The next trip to Houston, will probably tie in with a family vacation to Tx. sometime in July.  

We are making arrangements to give Rich a retirement party in the field as well.  I was responsible for donations as you know (got to keep it quiet now but we are getting him a four wheeler).  Rick and Arnie are setting up the party which will probably be on April 13 and most likely in Belen, Nm.

p.m., so mark your calendars accordingly.  If that is not correct, I'll let
you know.  Directions will be provided before the event.

Kim has doffed her toque long enough to do research on various recipes a la
Francais, and we submit the following assignments pour du nuit:

=================================================
Jennifer & Jerry -

Bring French bread, plus

Title: Roasted Garlic

Servings: 2
Total Time: 45 min.
Baking Time: 40 min.
Preparation Time: 5 min.
Comments:
This a really simple appetizer to make. If you haven't had roasted garlic
before, you'll be amazed how roasting makes the pungent garlic into a
buttery, mellow spread. I like it best spread on fresh bread with goat
cheese on top. Its also a great butter and mayonnaise substitute for
sandwiches, that's low in calories. (Ignore the 83% fat percentage in the
nutritional information below, its counting all of the olive oil, most of
which slips off) The whole head of garlic has only 24 calories!!

Ingredients:
1 head garlic
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
Instructions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Chop top 1/5 of garlic head (from the pointy
tip).  Discard any extra garlic skin, leaving most of it intact.  Place
garlic head in a medium sized piece of aluminum foil.  Pour olive oil on top
of garlic.  Wrap foil around garlic, encompassing the entire head.  Bake in
oven until the garlic is golden brown and the garlic pulp is easily removed
from its individual shell (around 40 minutes).  Remove from oven; let cool.

plus

Baked Pears on Sugared Puff Pastry with Caramel Sauce

plus Red Pepper Soup (to be faxed by Kim to 409-938-3710)

================================================
Tom & Jerilynn - our hosts for the evening

pate (purchased), cocktail party toast
