Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

2,"Questions about 12/29 rentroll:

 There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other 
for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?

 Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For 
what periods?

 
What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this 
right?  Has the deposit been made yet?


 A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.

The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others 
wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 
months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are 
amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will 
be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely 
implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.  
Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there.  
interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.  
definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until 
latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be 
unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one 
year ago and not a significant loss of demand.   
market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a 
very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low.  
Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been 
significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they

WILL wonders never cease? Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on=
 the table.=20
Mark McGwire, the home-run-hitting baseball player for St. Louis, retired. =
And he let it be known that he never signed a two-year, $30 million contrac=
t his agent negotiated last spring. Why? Because he wanted to find out if h=
is injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before. It =
didn't, and he decided he wasn't worth that kind of money.
Then Ken Lay, chairman of Enron Corp., said he won't take the $60.6 million=
 he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when En=
ron is sold to Dynegy Corp.=20
Of course, neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback r=
etirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket, carrying them to the=
 car and hoping for a big tip. Still, it was a class act on both their part=
s. McGwire only hit .187 last season, well below his lifetime average. And =
Lay? Well, let's say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has =
a company sunk as fast as Enron.=20
Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $82 a share. Now it'=
s hovering in the single-digit level, and Enron is being forced to sell its=
elf to a smaller rival.=20
The stock price incentive=20
How did Enron get into this position? Put the blame on the company's relent=
less drive to push up its stock price. And a big reason for that push comes=
 from the way American companies compensate top executives.=20
In the last couple of decades, executive compensation has soared. The avera=
ge chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary, bonuses=
 and stock options as the average factory worker.=20
Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren't relev=
ant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn't come from base pay or=
 bonuses but from stock options.=20
Such options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousa=
nds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future =
date. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the sto=
ck on the date the options were granted. If the stock increases past the ex=
ercise price in the option, the executive can buy the stock and then sell i=
t, making big bucks. It the stock has dropped below the option price - it's=
 underwater, in the jargon - then those options are worthless.=20
Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh=
olders, those who favor this sort of incentive say. And that's true, if you=
 talking about in-and-out traders. But it's not true if we're looking out f=
or the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term.=20
Keeping the debt hidden=20
Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron.=20
To hype the stock, Enron's execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it=
s amazing growth and some of its dicier investments, in partnerships. Enron=
 was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals. That way it could m=
ove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership. That, in=
 turn, made the company's earnings look better.=20
When Enron's executives finally fessed up, they had to write down their pro=
fits over the past few years by 20 percent. But the real irony here is that=
 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money. But by that time, the majori=
ty of shareholders simply had no faith in Enron's bookkeeping.=20
Now look at Lay's compensation. In 1999 he exercised stock options and made=
 $44 million on them. In 2000, sales of options brought him $123 million, a=
nd this year about $26 million, according to a study published by Bloomberg=
 News.=20
Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab=
le? I don't think so. He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g=
overnance. He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders.=
=20
The shareholders were happy with that high stock price. Nobody - besides so=
me stock analysts - complained about Enron's often- impenetrable bookkeepin=
g until that stock price started to fall.=20
Would Enron's bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe=
wer stock options? Maybe.=20
Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys. And no one would=
 want that job if he were only going to make $10 million a year instead of =
$100 million.=20
Just kidding.

Investing
Bullish, and Patient, on Energy Stocks
By JAN M. ROSEN

11/18/2001
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DESPITE last week's plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o=
il companies, some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the long-term p=
rospects for energy stocks.=20
''These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities,'' said Tina=
 Vital, an oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor's, who recommends a broad=
 group of integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, R=
oyal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf. ''They have excellent management, a =
top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors,'' she said, provided=
 that investors are patient and can bear short-term swings.
Last week's price declines were set off by Russian oil companies' refusal t=
o accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f=
or big production cuts. They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v=
olatile. ''Oil could go to $10 a barrel short term,'' she said, but there i=
s no certainty of that. The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua=
ry, sending prices upward. Over the long term, she expects to see productio=
n cuts.=20
Demand for energy has grown only 0.5 percent this year, and prices have bee=
n declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline -- as drivers hav=
e seen at the gas pump. West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at $18.=
03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 58 cents from its Thursday close=
, the lowest since June 1999. But an economic recovery, expected by late 20=
02, could cause demand to pick up, analysts say.=20
As oil prices have dropped, so have the prices of most oil stocks, but not =
as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000. Over that period=
, the S.& P. energy index has lost 8 percent, while the S.& P. 500-stock in=
dex is down 23 percent.=20
A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept=
. 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country's economic slowdown, ''t=
hey are not expected to result in any long-term volatility in energy market=
s.'' The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1.7 perc=
ent a year through 2020, instead of the 1.2 percent predicted only a year a=
go. Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment,=
 and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.=20
WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead=
, other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term. L. Bruce Lanni, s=
enior oil analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in New York, said that any potent=
ial price war was likely to be fairly short-lived, because neither OPEC nor=
 non-OPEC countries could ''withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period=
 of time,'' and prices should rebound sharply as a result, ''back up in the=
 lower to mid-$20 range.''=20
Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term=
, but Mr. Lanni, too, sees value in the stocks.=20
His top pick is Conoco, now trading at $24.30; his 12-month target is $34. =
''We remain confident,'' he said, ''that the company's annual oil and gas p=
roduction should grow by about 4 percent, on average, over the next several=
 years.''=20
Conoco's debt, at 55 percent of capital, is relatively high, but he expects=
 the company's strong cash flow -- it equaled $5.33 a share last year -- to=
 reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003. T=
he company's after-tax interest cost is only 3.5 percent, he said.=20
Mr. Lanni also favors Kerr-McGee, a natural gas exploration and production =
company, and BP, calling both undervalued. He regards Exxon Mobil, Royal Du=
tch/Shell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced, so he is not recommending buyi=
ng them now. ''If you own them, hold them,'' he said.=20
William Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal=
yst at UBS Warburg, said he felt ''near-term caution but medium-term optimi=
sm for sustainably higher'' natural gas prices. He said he would encourage =
investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies=
 over the next two months. His top picks are Apache, Kerr-McGee and EOG Res=
ources.=20
Such stocks are highly volatile, he said. They are ''trading-oriented vehic=
les, and short-term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m=
ost attractive entry and exit points,'' he said. ''While natural gas prices=
 declined throughout most of this year, prices rose at a startling pace, fr=
om $1.75 per million cubic feet at the end of September to over $3 per mill=
ion cubic feet within weeks.''=20
He cited three reasons for the price rally: a decline in gas surpluses, pre=
dictions of a colder-than-normal winter and what he has called ''pathetic t=
hird-quarter natural gas production,'' despite record drilling activity.=20
The tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the rec=
ent price increase for natural gas futures, he said. Enron, which marketed =
25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, or more than 40 percent of the =
nation's demand, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission and announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from de=
als with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer. It also=
 reported a third-quarter loss and restated earlier earnings. Enron has agr=
eed to be taken over by Dynegy, a smaller rival, for about $9 billion in st=
ock. Dynegy is also assuming about $13 billion in debt.=20
Anxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha=
ve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices. While it is ''d=
ifficult to quantify the Enron factor,'' Mr. Featherston said, the short-te=
rm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over.=20
OTHER factors, of course, could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors=
 over the next several months. The status of the war against terrorism, Pre=
sident Bush's decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helpin=
g OPEC in reducing excess global capacity, and a United Nations review of t=
he food-for-oil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi=
ficant impact on battered oil prices.=20
Nevertheless, Ms. Vital said, for the long term, energy will probably be in=
 short supply, and new sources must be developed. So she also likes the pro=
spects of two drilling companies, Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries. Bot=
h took a beating last week, along with the oil companies, so again she sees=
 buying opportunities.=20
Bern Fleming, portfolio manager of the AXP Utilities Income fund in Minneap=
olis, who has stakes in Dynegy, Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, said al=
l three had good prospects for growth, thanks to a mix of assets, ''managem=
ent I respect and solid business plans.''

Aquila Energy Makes Provision for Dynegy Withdrawal, FT Says
2001-11-18 19:52 (New York)

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Aquila Energy Corp. is one of
several energy traders limiting its trading with Enron Corp. in
case Dynegy Inc. pulls out of its bid for the company, the
Financial Times said, citing Aquila.

     Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegy
withdrew from its $24 billion takeover of Enron, the paper
reported.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, decided to sell after its
shares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accounting
irregularities limited its ability to finance operations. Enron's
collapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where the
company does one-quarter of all gas and power trades.

     Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw from
the transaction under certain circumstances, the FT said.



PERSPECTIVES
A tale of greed and hubris
Waldo Proffitt

All
F2
(Copyright 2001)

For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of =
public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story =
as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly =
of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy.=
=20
A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the uti=
lity industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock=
 was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought=
 by a competitor. There was fear the company's bond rating might fall to th=
e ""junk"" level.
What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, =
but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris=
.=20
Not too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company =
in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acq=
uiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities.=20
It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and the=
ir key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by=
 selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its ge=
nerating plants and became the biggest ""power broker"" in the nation.=20
Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca=
lifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the fir=
st power barons to take advantage of California's flawed deregulation law -=
- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies.=20
The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulat=
ion, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reaso=
n to examine its business ethics.=20
Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt=
 no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial off=
icer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part=
nerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of th=
ese arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear th=
at the Enron insiders made millions for themselves.=20
Enron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.=
2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs=
tated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistak=
e is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c=
onfidence of investors.=20
So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron's leade=
rs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting be=
cause they had friends in high places.=20
The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George=
 W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the =
new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush's top political strategist,=
 owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after h=
e had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain=
s tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence=
 Lindsey, the president's chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, V=
ice President Cheney's chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey wa=
s paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron.=20
Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush's four political=
 campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for=
 president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush's campai=
gn, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Pres=
idential Inauguration Committee.=20
Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments,=
 administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the o=
verall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo=
rable to the interests of Enron.=20
And now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuve=
rs by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilme=
n in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in =
Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thin=
king its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to=
 reprimand?=20
Or, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get m=
uch attention from the federal government? Or from voters?=20

Counting Blessings Along With the Losses

Try finishing this sentence: ""The best thing about my experience as an inve=
stor in 2001 was ... ""=20
Many Americans, contemplating the losses they've suffered this year in the =
stock market, might say there was nothing ""best"" about what happened to the=
m--in fact, nothing good at all, perhaps other than that it might have been=
 worse.
With share prices on the rise again, the damage to portfolios has been less=
ened. Even so, stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks =
to keep this from being the market's worst calendar year since 1977.=20
The blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.6% last week, but it's sti=
ll down 13.8% year to date.=20
Yet those losses, while certainly not trivial (especially when they're your=
s), can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this year's=
 experiences.=20
With investing, adversity can be a more important teacher than success. If =
you're having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful=
 about anything investment-related, try these on for size:=20
* ""Asset allocation"" is no longer just a quaint theory. The paramount inves=
ting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk. But i=
t took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home fo=
r many people who thought equities only rose in value.=20
Now, millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much=
 they can lose in stocks--and how bonds and short-term cash savings can off=
set market losses and preserve capital.=20
It has been a hard lesson, to be sure. But investors who take asset allocat=
ion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in=
 the long run. And don't underestimate what that can mean for your peace of=
 mind long term.=20
* The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned. In the =
late 1990s, many economists lamented how the U.S. savings rate continued to=
 shrink. Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums=
 into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be=
 rising nonstop.=20
In other words, many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin=
g for them when share prices were rising 20% or more each year.=20
Now, with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns=
 on stocks in this decade, it's clear that many people will have to find a =
way to save regularly if they're going to meet their long-term financial go=
als, especially retirement.=20
This may not be a pleasant reality, but it's better for most people to have=
 faced this fact sooner rather than later, while there may be time to make =
up lost ground.=20
* A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos=
e who tout them. The market's slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street=
 analysts, money managers and others whose knowledge, understanding and jud=
gment were clearly lacking, in retrospect.=20
Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the=
mselves as ""experts"" is a highly dangerous strategy, if it can be called a =
strategy at all.=20
Sure, it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo=
on and nobody had much use for reviewing a company's fundamentals. But that=
 wasn't investing--it was speculating, and on a massive, and ultimately rui=
nous, scale.=20
People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar=
ket, and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por=
tfolios in the long run.=20
Just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401(k) retirement savings sum into=
 aggressive-growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000--right before =
the market peaked--because of the bullish comments of some 25-year-old tech=
 stock analyst. Those investors aren't likely to make a move like that agai=
n.=20
* Free-market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies. Capi=
talism may be harsh, but it's efficient when the good times end and it's ti=
me to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power--and des=
erve more capital.=20
Hundreds of dot-coms have failed, but who really misses them? Is it any har=
der to find what you want on the Internet? It probably would have been much=
 worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors' funds =
for another year instead of failing when they did.=20
But the market isn't just eliminating small companies that never had much o=
f a future. The financial near-collapse of energy giant Enron Corp. exposed=
 a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit--to the point =
that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to=
 1997 ""should not be relied upon.""=20
Also to be weeded out, though over a longer time period, will be mutual fun=
d managers whose performance running other peoples' money has been a nightm=
are for those investors--meaning, the returns produced have been far worse =
than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that par=
ticular sector.=20
These managers know who they are--and, hopefully, their shareholders know b=
y now as well, and will vote with their feet.=20
The free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control p=
rices.=20
Once again, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost its =
ability to prop up crude oil prices, which have sunk to two-year lows amid =
the weak global economy. That's lousy for OPEC, but it's great for every en=
ergy consumer.=20
* The market's woes have altered many investors' priorities for the better.=
 The wild bull market of the late 1990s demanded peoples' attention, and go=
t it.=20
For some, stocks became an obsession. Their portfolios dominated their live=
s, especially if they were actively trading shares. They believed they were=
 going to be rich, or richer, and that it was all because of how smart they=
 were.=20
Now, most people have been humbled by the market. In the process, some have=
 realized that they don't want their mood determined by their portfolio's d=
ay-to-date price changes.=20
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, of course, also changed many peoples' view =
of what truly matters to them.=20

NEW YORK -- Volatility and premiums on Enron's near-month options remain ex=
tremely high. It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price f=
or option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston co=
mpany sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled=
 investors.=20
Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet sessio=
n Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded =
more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Boar=
d Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 =
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Enron's calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate incom=
e. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a thre=
e-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on=
 Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dyn=
egy Inc. Enron's December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compar=
ed with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.=20
For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the ""wash =
sale"" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from =
selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring ""substantially i=
dentical"" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This=
 poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri=
ces now make them attractive ""buy"" candidates.=20
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w=
ash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money pu=
t, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir=
ed by the investor.=20
So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by ""doubling up"": buyi=
ng additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling =
the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, w=
hich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi=
tional stock.

Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is=
 coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=
ibillion-dollar deal.=20
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh=
ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading comp=
any, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During t=
he past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised do=
wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion redu=
ction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=
erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=
ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=
ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=
han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =
shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =
In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =
volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=
y lower, market observers said.=20
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=
ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=
gy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=
ve Chuck Watson said his company was working ""to accelerate the regulatory =
approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously=
 announced agreement"" though it continued to perform ""due diligence"" on Enr=
on.=20
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk=
 away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=
nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=
called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=
is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=
omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=
., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a=
 drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,=
 two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=
ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=
on contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =
planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=
nformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=
ldn't be determined what the new information was.=20
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=
 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving=
 the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =
However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =
Dynegy.=20
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=
8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =
of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula=
 price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=
nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=
ding relatively close to the offering price.=20
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=
itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =
and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=
ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,=
 would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=
 at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=
blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than=
 Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a ""likely scenario""=
 is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15=
 Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20
Such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal. According=
 to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the ex=
change formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of En=
ron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was =
above $80 a share.=20
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=
ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=
. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=
t the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could ""recover =
the significant business that has been lost"" in its giant energy-trading op=
erations. ""The Enron machine continues to sputter,"" Mr. Fleischer wrote.=20
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren=
egotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l=
aw filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba=
nkers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing ""is highly possible,""=
 said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency=
. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not=
ch above noninvestment-grade, or ""junk,"" status. But Fitch also said it bel=
ieved Enron's trading partners had made ""significant cash collateral calls""=
 in recent days that are ""well in excess of previous expectations,"" contrib=
uting to ""liquidity pressures.""=20
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=
m of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-=
workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spok=
eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor=
e doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the m=

 it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Cit=

$3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing

Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football 
Newsletter! The newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox 
at the end of every week, and will include news about the 
web site; tips on using all the features available; and 
answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron 
Guru."" 


PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS

The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are
on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin
with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, 
with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)

If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, 
Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds 
they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not 
determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. 
The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding 
the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your 
regular season. 

If your team is still in contention, go to 
NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes 
during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be 
available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff 
matchup.


GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS

Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did
in each game this season. The player's statistics in the 
common categories will be displayed for each game. If you
are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to
see who's been getting the most consistent production.

61,"Getting lots of questions on Martin.  Nothing definitive yet, but here's the
latest I have from the New York Daily News by By Rich Cimini:
http://www.nydailynews.com/2000-11-22/Metro_Sports/Football/a-89509.asp
From the article:  ""The Jets provided no update yesterday on Curtis Martin,
but his injury isn't believed to be serious. His status for Sunday's game
against the Bears remains in doubt. It appears that Martin was drilled in
the tailbone by a Dolphins defender. It swelled up on the team flight back
from Miami, and ice was applied. Al Groh has declined to provide specifics,
except to say the injury occurred in the ""general pelvic region.""
The Jets' star running back, who underwent intensive treatment yesterday,
has told several people that he's fine. He's known for his high pain
threshold, and it wouldn't shock teammates if he played this week.

My View:  Players are notorious for being optimistic but Martin is a tough
guy.  Another reason why these Thursday games are so tough.  If you wanted
waffling, you wouldn't be signed up for this newsletter so I'm going to say
as of Wednesday morning, I think the chances he plays effectively as
normally would are 75%.
Thanks to my friend Nicholas Bollini for assistance on this one.
Good Luck this weekend.

on-line.  He asked that we go into their website and register EPMI as one of 
PECO's counterparties;  this will give us access to their online-checkout 
system.  The url is www.exeloncorp.com.........  Go to PowerTeam then Tie Out

myself or if one of you guys wants to take care of it...

79,"We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.",,,Enron

Hey, how's it going?  Gone fishing lately?  I talked to Kayne earlier today 
about a posting this guy is interested.  Kayne tells me you are the man with 
the opening.  I just wanted to forward this to you so you could take a look 
at.  Jay schedules gas for EES and is interested in your position.  I 
explained to him generally what the position is about, but things have 
changed.  He says he talked to Larry Campbell also. In fact, Larry might have 
talked to you about him already.  I haven't worked with him before, so I 
can't specifically vouch for his work ability (Larry can fill you in better 
in that area), but he does have good communications skills and is easy to get 
along with...(team player).  Also, he is an internal employee.   Attached 
below is his resume.

11:22 02Aug2001 RSF-Ill. Quad Cities 2 nuke shut after lightning strike

    NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Exelon Nuclear said Thursday a lightning strike at the Quad Cities plant in Cordova, Ill. caused a fire in unit 2's main transformer that caused the 789-megawatt (MW) unit to shut down.
    Exelon said in a statement that the fire was quickly extinguished at 8:45 a.m. Central Time by the site's fire brigade and the Cordova Fire Department. The lightning strike occurred at about 8:15 a.m.
    With the loss of the off-site power during the event, Exelon declared an ""Unusual Event"" at 8:23 a.m. An Unusual Event is the lowest of four emergency classifications used by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to categorize events at commercial nuclear power plants.
    Exelon said there were no injuries and no potential for a radioactivity release as a result of the fire. The main transformer is located outside the plant.
    Exelon said the adjacent 789-MW unit 1 continues to operate at a slightly reduced power level.

Time:  4:00 pm

96,"Shona, Brent and Sally,
This morning, the cash flows from approximately 75 books were not received by 
Infinity from the ERMS system.  We normally get 375 books and only got 296 
this morning.

Per conversation with Joyce Kuo and Mike Moscoso, Susan Trevino, Risk 
Controls,  and Christian, RAC, changed the book heirarchy on Friday, moving 
global products books, including the prepays, out of the ECT group and into 
another group.  We have had discussions in the past verifying with Risk 
Controls that the ECT group is the only group which automatically sends its 
cash flows to Infinity.  Other cash flows from books are included only by 
being listed in a script.  This was not done when the books were moved from 
the ECT Group on Friday.

102,"Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving 
to Connecticut soon to join her husband.  He has been working up there for 
the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our 
weather derivatives team about a year ago.  She hopes to continue to work for 
Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I 
can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York 
office.  

It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn 
could be someone for you to consider.   She came originally from the London 
office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some 
feedback on her.  In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very 
early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.  She came to 
Houston and  has done a number of different things.  I think that she is well 
organized and control minded.  Understands Enron's business.  Managing a 
group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.  I am not sure that 
people enjoy working under her.  That could be old news, however.  There are 
a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her 
based on very recent experience.  Do you know of her?  

Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.  
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.  She would 
definitely represent an Enron point of view.  They have two small daughters - 
she might be interested in something part time even.  Could mean lower cost 
that way.  

This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.  
If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you 
could go to for some fact finding around her.  Let me know.  --Sally   ","Kathryn Corbally Kathryn

I have been sort of waiting to talk to you about having a small event for my direct reports to thank them for their efforts until things cooled down at the company overall, but -- I don't see that happening any time soon.

We have not really done anything at all this year, and I wanted to do an event similar to the one you had last summer for us.  They have worked so hard and we can't ever all get away from the office at the same time  -- even to have a lunch.

Was thinking about having them over to my house for drinks and then out to eat at a restraunt.  For my direct reports and spouses.  Will include both Global Services and EES.  Was thinking of Friday night after work Dec 7th.  Need to get planning if I get the go ahead.

I have a reasonably priced italian restraunt in mind, and it would be about 20 people.   Are you ok with that? And if so, would you and David want to come too?

I see more commodities than Power. Metals will arrive September 25, Weather=

EBS is on the way. I only see Metals, IRFX and Weather as active desks this=

see some structures/cross commidity/finance deals go through. Thus we have =
a=20
mix of activites from Enron APACHI, Enron Global Markets, EBS and Enron=20
Metals. Basically everyone wants to do some business in Japan.

To coordinate all these activities we need to build the most cost efficient=

=20
Sydney is an alternative that has been discussed extensive lately, and is=

highly recommended from our side. Labour costs in Sydney is 25% of the cost=
s=20
in Tokyo. Due to Sydney's experience and size they are ready to expand and=

take on this project. They already have the segregation and independence in=

I wanted to give you the courtesy of hearing directly from me that I 
submitted my resignation earlier today.    With a bright and busy 10-month at 
home and another along the way, I am finding it difficult to manage my 
priorities and balance my time with ever-increasing job responsibilities.  I 
know that I will not work when I have the second child and want to make the 
most complete and successful transition as possible for both myself and 
Enron.  

I have yet to discuss with Sally my departure date, but have left it open for 
discussion since I have no urgent deadline to meet.   I know that I owe the 
Southern Cone some more process flows, which I fully intend to deliver.   

I have greatly enjoyed the past four years at Enron, and will miss many 
aspects of my job and the company.   If you have any specific requests prior 
to my departure, or recommendation regarding length of notice, I would 
appreciate hearing from you.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

140,"Dear all,

As you know, we will be hosting staff from MG tomorrow evening and on 
Wednesday and Thursday evening for a presentation/overview on Enron and a 
tour of Enron House.  The MG Staff have not been selected by department for 
these events, but rather have been given the option to sign up on a 
first-come, first-serve basis.  I anticipate having approximately 35 people 
on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday and 35 on Thursday.  The members of MG's 
management who joined us on the 8th of June are not attending this week in 
order to provide their colleagues with an opportunity to visit the building 
(hence the smaller numbers).

The purpose of these events is to help MG staff get better acquainted with 
Enron and to see first-hand where they will be relocating to in September.  
To this end, I would like to invite all of you to attend at least one of 
three events with a view to being on hand to act as a host/hostess, 
potentially join tours of the building and to be on hand to field any 
specific questions which may come up about your respective departments.  I 
hope this will also prove to be a good opportunity for you to meet MG staff 
on a more informal basis.  

The schedule of events each night will be as follows: 

17:45 - 18:00  MG Staff Arrive at Enron House

18:00 - 18:05  Welcome and Introductions:  Eric Gadd

18:05 - 18:15  Enron Video

18:15 - 18:40  Presentation on Enron and Enron Europe: Mark Schroeder

         John Thompson (Thursday)

18:40 - 19:30   Tours of Enron House/Drinks & Canap,s

19:30 - 19:45  Depart for Home by Bus to Liverpool Street Station [or 
Directly from Enron House]


I know that many of you have been keen to participate in this kind of 
informal event with our new colleagues at MG, so I hope you will be able to 
join us.   So that we can get a feel for numbers, I would appreciate it if 
you could RSVP to me by 2:00 p.m. tomorrow regarding your participation for 
all three events.  Please note that due to a number of Enron staff 
participating in the Chase Corporate Challenge on Wednesday evening, I am 
very short on ""tour guides"".  So, if you can make it on Wednesday evening and 
if you feel up to it, please advise if you can lead a tour of the building (a

FYI, here is an update from our meeting today,	

I did some checking to follow up on the Socal Window issue discussed in the meeting  today with our TMS IT team and Mary Draemer to find out the exact date when we implemented the EDI Socal Capacity Window. It was implemented on April 27, 2000. Socal began sending us the window volume via EDI at this time. Prior to this date, they faxed it to TW and the reps. would load that volume into the capacity system for the Socal point. Linda Ward thinks that we have the old fax documents saved in the file room.

Mary and I also called the EDI Hub team to find out how far back they store our EDI files. Currently the EDI Hub keep six months of data then the archive it. We could get to that date if needed. They would be a charge involved to pull archived data.

Wayne on the TMS team will also check to see if this information is replicated to adhoc (meaning we keep a complete history), or if it is not replicated (meaning we only keeps six months of data).

Please let me know if you need any other information.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I have just recieved my pay stub for the period ending 11/30/01.
For the first time, it shows an incredibly disturbing number related to imputed income.
Total Earnings = $352,171
Total Earnings plus Imputed = $1,338, 394.08 
Taxes withheld = $19,895.

I do not have any clue as what this imputed income is or why it may be attributed to me.  However,  as I understand it, I am liable for the taxes to the IRS even though I received no benefit. From our last conversation, I was told that $57k was sent to IRS to settle this amount and ?86k for uK liabilities. My calculation of the liability is much higher - somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% x 1,338,395 or $535,358.  Please give me a full accounting of the taxable liabilities incurred by Enron on my behalf for the tax year 2001 for both the us and uk and the tax payments made. I would appreciate that this could be done in the next 24 hours as it is causing immense stress.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

In the latest conversation with Harold Barth, a field engineer with Solar, we 
were told that the equipment data received last week was a best case 
scenario.  The fuel consumption rate was displayed in MMbtu/hr., and due to 
the heating value used, we should divide this number by .92 to get Scf/hr..  
When this is done, the rate that coincides with a 20 degree inlet temperature 
is 49.42 standard cubic feet per hour, which is slightly greater than what 
our permit says should be our maximum fuel consumption rate.  Harold also 
stated that achieving this rate on a daily basis is unrealistic, since these 
figures are based on new equipment in perfect condition.  Solar does not 
publish maximum fuel consumption figures, much like the auto manufacturers, 
since this is dependent upon site specific operating conditions.  He 
suggested that we add our 10% cushion factor to this data, and submit it to 
the State.  I'm sure that Harold would provide a written statement regarding 
the status of our equipment,  that could be used as documentation for the 
state, if you deem it necessary.  Let me know what you think!  Rich has 
suggested that we have a conference call to discuss possible solutions to the 
problem, so let me know.

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the ""fatal-flaw"" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events 
coordinated.  John Shafer

There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

235,"I received a call from the consultant who performed the archeology survey at 
stations 1 and 2.  Based upon the plot plan provided by construction, the 
archeology discovery at station 1 does not occur within the area of proposed 
impact, even though  part of the discovery is within the facility fence.  The 
report  recommendation to the SHPO by the archeologist will be that during 
construction activities in this area, an archeologist be onsite to monitor 
and ensure that the site is not impacted.  They will also recommend that we 
fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline 
activities will not disrupt the site.  

I have asked that two reports be prepared for each site.  One report for each 
station covering the construction areas and the other reports to include the 
entire 40 acres at each compressor station.  All four reports will be 
submitted to Bret Fritch in Omaha on Monday, the 26th of March.",Bret Fritch,,SHPO
236,"I spoke with Ken Jacobs, with the Forest Service in Flagstaff, concerning his 
agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.  As a condition 
of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine 
trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for 
identification.  After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him 
so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest 
Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges 
will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.  The charges will 
depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the 
trees which are flagged.

As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits 
and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged 
and I will contact Ken Jacobs so that he can make a site visit.",Ken Jacobs,,"the Forest Service the Forest

238,"John, I was just thinking that if this deconning becomes a routene activity 
for us and PG&E, we might want to consider breaking  in a company that is 
less expensive, can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work 
product.  Vector, has to travel  from Ohio.   Deconning the separators 
becomes an internal  washing job of the vessel.  

I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else.  Tiny, do 
you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PG&E?  
As you know, they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA, but with the 
new PCB rules in place, a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning 
activities.  How do you think PG&E will respond to us possibly using another 
contractor other than Vector for the work.  I suppose we can bring this issue 
up in Flagstaff.

Mums the word on the PCB modeling issue, John.  Thanks for your guidance and 
thoughts.

239,"Atttended the NMOGA meeting in Farmington, NM.  It appears that the BLM will 
implement its own noise criteria in areas within New Mexico that are deemed 
sensitive by the BLM.  The proposed noise threshold will be 48.6 DBA(A).  
There are no Transwestern facilities in the Farmington resource area which 
will be impacted by this proposed level, however the potential exists for 
several Transwestern locations in southeast New Mexico to be impacted.  

A meeting was held with the president of Del Mar, concerning the issues 
associated with the lead in their lead acetate tape for monitoring sulfur 
concentrations in the natural gas.  A  request  was made to the company to 
determine the feasability of recycling the tape and eleviate the management 
and disposal issues associated with the tape as a hazardous waste.  

The quarterly SoCal Transwestern PCB conference call was held this week.  
Transwesten's share (86%) of SoCal's PCB management activities was approx. 
$79,000.  Due to the press release  by PG&E concerning the increased 
occurance of PCB's into their system, SoCal has initiated increased sampling 
activities on their system and will be proposing to do additional monitoring 
to track liquids from Transwestern's M/S into the SoCal system.  Preliminary 
sampling results at strategic liquids locations on the SoCal system has 
revealed hits of PCB's in the range of 7-10 ppm, although, a  hit of 77 ppm  
was discovered.  

As a result of an isolated hit of PCB's into the new filter separator at the 
PG&E C/S in excess of regulated levels, a  conference call was held the ET&S 
VP to determine forthcoming activities with PG&E.  A meeting has been 
scheduled at the PG&E C/S next week to reveiw sampling on the PG&E system and 
discuss the recent hit of PCB's in the F/S and what forthcoming activities 
will be conducted at the site.",Atttended the NMOGA Transwestern PCB,"79,000 77 ppm

240,"David, I got hte same message from Don.  I found out he became a believer about a couple of months ago and I have been spending a little time sharing Christ with him.  Im sure hes going through a tough period now.  If you saved his address you may want to congraulate him into the family.  Thanks for the prayers.  Its funny, but Im not too shook up about this.  what ever happens happens and I know I cant do anything about it.  It must the the Spirit within me, but Im relatively calm about the whole situation.  I find that when I hang aroundthe guys in the office and we start gripping, I loose my focus and start looking like a carnal Christian.  So Im better off away from the troops and just trnding to business.  Bill Kendrick seems to be pretty focused also. Im glad for that.  I know hes under a lot of stress.     

It seems the people tied to the pipeline assets are the safest.  If it is a business unit with income coming in, Enron wants you.  The gossip and garbage going around about what and how Enron is going to do to bail itself out is rampant.  I just know that there arent too many people loyal to Enron right now. Many fortunes and retirements have been lost and many of those who had retired in the last several months are trying to get back on with the different companies.   Someone said 4500 people in Enron Houston were given pink slips.  This is a bad time for all with Christmas around the corner, but then maybe, just like September 11, maybe its another wake up call for people to understand that the things in this world arent very stable and reliable.  I hope that this turns many to Jesus.  Another one of those Romans 8:28 passages which seems to have direct relevance right now.  If you can, say a prayer for those that arent employeed anymore and feel like they have lost everything.  

Hope your holidays will be blessed with some of your family coming in. Do you have plans to do any downhill skiing in Quatar over Christmas....

Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for 
the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily 
set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This 
means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the 
allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This 
generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be 
operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority 
to apply a 10%safety factor.

For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers 
guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears 
that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit 
limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions 
limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.

Northern Natural Gas Company

A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to 
the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 
emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V 
facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not 
greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being 
conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. 

EOTT
A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove 
the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data 
on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for 
VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit. 

General

Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held 
next week in Albuquerque.

Mike,

I'm glad to hear things are going well!  Everything at PwC is going pretty
good.  I'm still traveling quite a bit, today I'm in Indianapolis.  Laura
is keeping pretty busy at KPMG and working on re-decorating the house.
She's been talking a lot about having a baby so I'm not sure how long it'll
be before we have a little Duvall running around.  Hey, I just got a
message from Vogel on Pig Dinner, are you  planning on going this year?
Let me know because I'm going to try to make it finally, even though it's
on the worst day of the year for a tax accountant (April 13th).

Take Care,

Devin

Would you or someone in your group please investigate the allegations raised 
by Janeth Rodriguez-Philhower?  Based upon her voice mail message, there is a 
strong possibility of litigation.  Your investigation into her allegations 
thus would be conducted in anticipation of litigation.

Once you have conducted the investigation, please provide me with the results.

I would like the message to be even stronger than that -- he is not supposed to hire any outside counsel at all, for anything -- that is supposed to be done through legal department, per Jim Derrick's strictly-enforced rules.  He knows this and continues to violate that rule.  I suggest that he must hear a strong message, with disciplinary potential if he does it again.  Otherwise, this will have to be escalated to Derrick, since it continues to happen again despite my requests that he not do it.

In fact, he never contacts me for anything, which makes me nervous.  I would suggest that you would want him to have the same processes that we have in the rest of Enron regarding terminations of employment, which is that they go through legal if they are for any reason other than ROF.  That way, we may be able to catch some of the issues before they become more significant.  Similarly, I would like to be informed of employee relations issues that could bubble up into legal concerns.  I don't have much optimism for this, but still would like to ask for it!

The Coal group has a question related to personnel they would acquire from Vulcan if they purchased the marketing rights to their coal.    In this scenario, there are 4 marketing employees which would come to Enron as a part of the deal.   A few things:

In this case, I'm assuming these employees would resign from Vulcan and Enron would extend the appropriate offer.
Secondly, Enron's purchase of the marketing rights will be for an 18mo to 3 year trial period. At the end of the trial period, if Enron returns the marketing rights to Vulcan (or current owner), they want the right to re-call these employees.  George McClellan is ok with the right to recall, but I am not sure how/where to put this in writing ie; in the deal agreement, offer letter, etc.

Thanks,
Shanna",Michelle George McClellan Shanna,,Vulcan Enron

James Mcmillan called me this morning as Ned and I provide legal services on 
the Venezuela LNG project . FYI -  I am working on the commercial documents 
and Ned is working on the construction contract. James called me this morning 
to inquire who the right attorney is that he should be dealing with on 
consulting agreements related to the construction fo the project. ( It does 
get confusing as Ned is handling a consulting agreement for another fellow 
and we have each done consulting agreements for this group in the past - many 
international . )  James advised that you had been in a meeting with him a 
few weeks ago and he understood that you would be assisting and he was 
looking for confirmation of who to contact.  One particular agreement is with 
an individual named Voker Eyerman  who has been working with Enron on a 
contract basis   for 5 years. This individual is due to start work on this 
matter January 8th and James is concerned that this matter be taken care of 
before the holidays. This one seems pretty straight forward and I would be 
happy to do it this week but wanted to run this by you first. 

Let's talk about this at your convenience  today/tomorrow. I told James that 
I would have the time to attend to Voker's contract this week if you were 
unable to do so and that I would discuss this contract and the others with 
you. He is sending me Voker's existing agreement . Look forward to meeting 
you. Nancy 6,7790",James Mcmillan Ned James Voker Eyerman   Nancy,,LNG FYI Enron Voker

If Stacey can do it, so can I!  Here are the latest pictures of Cameron.

Thanks for all your work for the Travel Club.  I never make a meeting, but 
really enjoy the tickets, etc.

One question I have is whether Enron has any special relationships with 
Disney.  Are we a corporate client of Disney?  My old law firm had some sort 
of relationship with Disney that let us get great deals, early entry into the 
parks, etc., so it may be worth looking into.

Thanks again.

281,"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 8, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Skeena Cellulose, Inc. could be forced to close in another month because the local government is unwilling to continue subsidizing the Vancouver, B.C.-based firm's operations, Northern Development Minister Rick Thorpe told The Canadian Press.
Skeena's credit line expired on Thursday, and the government is now working with the Toronto-Dominion Bank to secure a one-month financial extension for its mill in Prince Rupert.
The mill, which has capacity to produce about 478,000 tonnes/yr of northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK), has taken considerable downtime this year. Skeena's 450 tonnes/day ""B"" line has remained shuttered since January, losing at least 12,000 tonnes per month or some 30 percent of its capacity. In July, the firm closed its ""A"" line as well, which has effectively shut its pulp production.
The Canadian government has been trying to sell the mill since it bailed out the struggling firm back in 1997 but in the current difficult pulp market few expected a deal could be made in the short term. But Thorpe warned the government would shut down the mill if that doesn't happen. The province, which owns 58.5 percent of Skeena, has invested about $178 million in the firm. Toronto-Dominion Bank, employees, and unions own the balance.
The latest development follows speculation from various British Columbia sources in recent weeks that Skeena would be shut down. ""There is speculation that (Skeena's second) line is down for good. It's highly likely that it will never come up again,"" said a B.C.-based source, who noted the operation has continued to absorb tax revenues.",Rick Thorpe Skeena Thorpe,about $178 million,"Skeena Cellulose, Inc.

282,"  Attached is the correlations for NBSK vs. paper grades.  Based on MT's advice I also did the correlations between the changes in these variables.
 In addition, I ran some regressions and the results are also in this spreadsheet. We will discuss these findings sometimes tomorrow morning. I have a meeting at 9 so after that I w'll be free.

Power Generation Asset and Portfolio Management Conference

 

March 26-28 2002, Atlanta, Georgia

 

OVERVIEW

 

This conference will highlight the commonalties and common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the enterprise.  The conference will emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing process.  The processes of Asset management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link short term issues of the trading & marketing departments. The purpose is to show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset owner.

Ancillary Services Conference

 

April 10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado

 

OVERVIEW

 

As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability. 

 

This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.

The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88

from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good.  
We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks 
like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried 
about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical 
moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.  
After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get 
tropical  moisture.

04/06/2001 
Public Broadcasting Report 
(c) Copyright 2001 Warren Communications News, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
Cable operators, programming networks, broadcasters, DBS providers, consumer 
electronics interests, Bell companies, ISPs, sports leagues, software 
developers, electronic program guide creators, personal video recording firms 
and consumer groups all battled over possible interactive TV (ITV) 
regulations at FCC. In comments filed in response to Commission's ITV 
inquiry, 28 entities debated whether federal govt. should regulate nascent 
interactive market in wake of AOL's takeover of Time Warner (TW) earlier this 
year. They also feuded over how govt. should define interactive services if 
it chose to regulate them.
Pushing for ""technologically neutral nondiscrimination safeguards"" on such 
vertically integrated MSOs as AOL TW, group of major programmers urged FCC to 
mandate that all broadband distributors carrying any ITV signals forward 
signals for all programmers on their cable systems. Group, consisting of 
Disney, Univision, USA Networks and Viacom/CBS, also called on Commission to 
ban discriminatory routing or caching practices that would permit cable 
operators to send their affiliated programming at faster speeds than rival 
networks. Programmers contended that consumers shouldn't have to buy 
additional set-top box to receive unaffiliated ITV services. ""It is far 
easier and requires far less intrusive government regulation to prevent 
monopoly power from distorting a relatively new market than it is to combat 
monopoly power already unleashed in a more developed market,"" group said. 
Public interest groups, ALTV, APTS, BellSouth, EarthLink, Gemstar-TV Guide 
International, MSTV, NAB, PBS (PBR March 23 p3) and SBC Communications all 
made similar arguments in favor of FCC's adopting ITV rules. For instance, 
joint filing by Media Access Project, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of 
America and Center for Media Education called on Commission ""to move 
expeditiously to begin a rulemaking establishing open access for providers of 
enhancements on all platforms, whether cable, DBS, DTV or new technologies 
yet unknown."" They contended that agency's failure to act would allow cable 
MSOs to ""become the gatekeepers of what has thus far been a gateless online 
community"" and devastate independent content providers. Without safeguards, 
they said, ""ITV is likely to become a digital mirror image of the current 
closed multichannel cable model.""
Regulatory opponents countered that imposing ITV restrictions on cable 
systems would discourage them from starting new services, hampering 
development of emerging industry. Opponents, including AOL TW, AT&T, 
Cablevision Systems, Charter, Canal Plus Technologies, Comcast, NCTA, NFL, 
OpenTV, Progress&Freedom Foundation and group of 4 programmers, declared it 
was too early to impose obligations on ITV providers. They said early 
regulation would be unworkable, creating administrative nightmare.
Calling even ""the threat of regulation"" of ITV market ""a major mistake,"" 
NCTA, for example, argued that ""there is simply no basis for assuming a 
problem and proposing regulatory solutions."" Saying FCC deliberately had 
refrained from imposing similar rules on cable high-speed data services, 
which are much further along in development, NCTA said Commission should 
refrain from regulating ITV services for same reason. It also warned that 
agency had very limited authority to regulate ITV services under 
Communications Act and easily could violate First Amendment rights of cable 
operators if it tried to do so. Calling inquiry ""a peculiar and misguided 
proceeding,"" NCTA said First Amendment ""would seem to preclude the very 
regulations suggested by the notice which would interfere with cable 
operators' constitutionally protected editorial judgments.""
Taking different tacks, DBS providers EchoStar and DirecTV said in separate 
filings that they wanted FCC to keep close tabs on cable operators so they 
wouldn't use their market power to keep interactive TV services from other 
multichannel operators, including satellite TV companies. DBS companies said 
they were concerned that cable companies might have unfair advantage in 
marketplace if both industries were regulated in same way by Commission.
DirecTV said it was ""premature"" for agency to fully regulate ITV services, 
but it favored ""continued monitoring by the FCC of the potential for 
anticompetitive behavior by cable operators."" ""Regulatory intervention at 
this nascent stage of ITV development makes little sense,"" DirecTV said: 
""There are as yet no dominant providers of ITV services, and the marketplace 
is still in the process of sorting out the technological standards"" that it 
will follow during future delivery. EchoStar said there was ""absolutely no 
basis for imposing"" ITV carriage obligations on distributors lacking market 
power in any relevant market such as itself. Such action would penalize new 
entrants and favor incumbent cable operators, filing said.
FCC/CAPITOL HILL
In action that will significantly limit number of low-power FM (LPFM) 
stations to be licensed, FCC released decision April 2 saying LPFM stations 
must meet same 3rd adjacent channel interference protection requirement as 
full-power stations. Order implements requirements of rider on FCC 
appropriations bill signed into law in Dec. Commission expects to complete 
action on its LPFM licensing window in few months, it said in order, and then 
will direct Mass Media Bureau to open window to allow LPFM applicants that 
didn't meet 3rd channel requirements to try to come into compliance. FCC 
Chmn. Powell said action allowed Commission to begin granting construction 
permits for at least some LPFM stations, and agency had begun independent 
testing to determine impact of LPFM stations on full-power FM stations and 
translators. As part of order, FCC also implemented congressional mandate 
that denies LPFM license to former pirate radio operators. FCC Comr. 
Furchtgott-Roth issued separate statement saying he supported move to 
implement congressional mandate but believed FCC should have delayed LPFM 
licensing while it went through rulemaking process in order to comply with 
Administrative Procedure Act.

302,Thanks again for the help.  Much appreciated.,,,
303,"? Sources report that SoCal Chairman, John Bryson, and Governor Davis were 
roommates together at Stanford in the early 60's.  This longstanding 
relationship may provide some explanation for SoCal's willingness to 
negotiate with the governor and the governor's determination to reach a 
solution with SoCal.

? Voluntary bankruptcy reportedly is ""not an option"" for SoCal.  However, the 
possibility remains that SoCal's creditors will take them into involuntary 
bankruptcy.  If the state's purchase of the transmission assets is delayed, 
it appears that the possibility of this occurring will increase.

? However, the agreement by the state to purchase SoCal's transmission assets 
is actually a Memorandum of Understanding. The agreement reportedly was 
rushed for ""political purposes,"" but the details still remain to be decided.  
It is possible, the 60-day deadline stated in the memorandum may have to be 
extended.

? PG&E reportedly refused to part with its transmission assets in its 
negotiations with the governor.  PG&E makes more money on transmission than 
distribution of power, the opposite is true for SoCal.",John Bryson Davis,,SoCal Stanford PG&E

Times are grim for farmers, caught between sagging prices, subsidies and 
livestock diseases. 
But the energy crunch may provide North America's farmers with another, 
lucrative line of work. Wind power has suddenly become viable and massive new 
projects have been announced both on and offshore.
In January, the Bonneville Power Administration (a hydro-electric utility 
operating in the Pacific Northwest) said it will buy 1,000 megawatts of wind 
energy by 2003. That's enough to supply a city of 500,000 people. 
Just before that announcement, another utility, FPL (Florida Power & Light) 
Energy, announced plans to build the largest ""wind farm"" in the world with 
turbines in Oregon and Washington, enough for 70,000 homes. Last year, 
Texas-based Enron Corp., an energy conglomerate, had just finished 700 
turbines in California, western Texas, Minnesota and Iowa. 
A handful of Canadian entities have announced small-scale projects within the 
past few months. 
What has changed is that wind power can be generated economically without 
subsidies, thanks to high fuel prices. 
What has also changed is that the wind power technology has improved 
dramatically. Equipment is less noisy and more attractive. Turbines have gone 
up 20-fold in price, but can produce 120 times more power than a generation 
ago. 
Another concern was that the fast-moving blades of wind turbines were killing 
birds. But newer designs are slower in speed and therefore less lethal. 
North America is way behind Europe in alternative energy, mostly because it 
is blessed with cheap, plentiful hydrocarbon sources. Only 1.5% of 
environmentally activist California's power needs are generated from wind 
turbines while Denmark and Germany depend on windpower for 6% of their 
supplies. Washington would like 5% of U.S. electricity generated from wind by 
2020. 
But it already makes sense. Fuel costs are so high the wind business is even 
profitable for small, independent farmers and landowners in breezy parts 
(read prairies) of the United States and Canada. By harnessing the wind, they 
can enhance their cash flow, keep their own lights burning brightly and look 
after the neighbours or the local power grid, too. 
Most significantly, in February, the world's biggest oil giant -- Royal Dutch 
Shell Group -- waded in with an announcement it will construct a wind 
mega-project or two. But Shell is going to create wind farms offshore, away 
from urban development and political objections. 
""Wind energy is set to be the major new offshore industry of the next 
generation,"" Shell said in February. 
""We believe that by deploying Shell's world-class commercial, technical and 
financial capabilities to large and challenging projects we are confident 
that we can become a major player in the global wind energy sector,"" David 
Jones, executive vice-president of Shell's wind energy business, said at a 
conference. 
""Wind is the most competitive of the renewable energy sources when comparing 
costs with conventional fuels,"" said Mr. Jones. ""Wind energy production is 
expected to increase rapidly as it moves offshore to achieve wind farms of 
greater scale."" 
The company is evaluating offshore sites in North America and Europe and is 
also involved in turbine manufacture. It operates small pilot projects in 
Europe capable of meeting the needs of only a few thousand consumers. 
Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, Shell's chairman, underscored the shift in energy 
sources from hydrocarbons to wind, biomass and other renewables. He 
maintained this is merely the continuation of a steady trend based on 
consumer demands. 
""The energy industry evolves giving products the customers want. In the last 
century, there was mostly coal used, with few liquids, then liquids replaced 
coal, then gas came along after World War II. History shows there has been a 
steady de-carbonization of fuel from wood to coal to oil and gas,"" he said in 
a panel I attended in February at the World Economic Forum in Davos, 
Switzerland. 
The world ""must take the climactic threat seriously"" by using hydrocarbons 
more efficiently. 
""We think we can make money at the moment out of wind, some out of biomass, 
but not photovoltaics [batteries],"" he added. ""We want to meet the 
aspirations and needs of our customers and society. It's both a commercial 
challenge and a commercial imperative. We're just starting [wind power] 
offshore, where people cannot object."" 
As for biomass, Shell has also been amassing forested acreage around the 
world which will eventually be the feedstock for fuel production from plant 
life. 
""Wind indeed is ready for prime time,"" Ralph Cavanagh, energy program 
director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group 
based in New York, said recently. 
Another environmentalist, Worldwatch Institute's Seth Dunn, pointed in an 
interview to a study by Shell showing that ""by 2050, over 50% of primary 
energy supply comes from renewables.""

The Hindu-Editorial: Time for negotiations

04/14/2001

Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

THE CYCLE OF claims and counter-claims between the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has reached a 
point where the only way the imbroglio can be resolved is by renegotiations. 
The process of both parties slapping claims on each other helps neither even 
as it leaves unaddressed the basic problems in the project. The conciliation 
and arbitration process that has begun is also unlikely to provide any 
answers to the larger questions because it is about a specific issue - the 
decision of the Central Government not to honour a counter-guarantee on a 
demand of Rs. 102 crores by the DPC because the MSEB's own claim of Rs. 400 
crores has not been settled - rather than about the deep flaws in the power 
purchase agreement itself. With the Godbole Committee calling for 
renegotiation to bring down the cost of Dabhol power, the Government of 
Maharashtra will now have to shed its ambivalence about where it stands on 
the project. 
While DPC has always been aggressive in asserting its rights, it cannot but 
be aware that it will be impossible for it to do business in the face of 
hostile public opinion and the increasingly ambivalent attitudes of the State 
and Central Governments as well. Given that in the U.S. the Enron Corporation 
itself has begun to exit from the energy production business and focus on the 
more profitable activity of energy trading this should be an additional 
factor working in favour of a renegotiated contract. But the question is how 
much such renegotiations will yield, for the fundamental problems of the 
Dabhol project were and still are about a very high capital cost, 
dollar-denominated tariffs and a contract for supply of liquefied natural gas 
(LNG) which will (after the implementation of the second phase) make DPC 
power all the more expensive if the plant were to operate at less than 80 per 
cent capacity. The Godbole Committee has not recommended scrapping the larger 
and more expensive Phase-II of the project and more disappointing for the 
State Government is that it has refused to bear the responsibility of 
renegotiations. It could not have been otherwise for a review committee can 
only provide the broad contours of a solution. When new negotiations begin 
with the DPC, as they now must lest the State and Central Government opt for 
the more dangerous course of arbitration, the MSEB and the Government of 
Maharashtra have to walk a tightrope. If the DPC were to be pushed too far it 
could choose arbitration and an arbitration panel based in London is more 
than likely to rule on the basis of narrow commercial considerations than on 
grounds of public policy, which is what the controversies in the Enron power 
project have all been about. On the other hand, renegotiations with a velvet 
glove are unlikely to do more than tinker with the contract.
Fortunately for the State and the Centre, worries about what the global 
investing community will feel about India exerting pressure on the DPC to 
modify the contract are now acknowledged as being mistaken. Globally, the 
flaws in the PPA have become so well-known that a Government that does not 
re-open the agreement is less likely to command respect than one that drives 
a new bargain in a transparent manner. In the process of looking afresh at 
the Enron project it does not help if issues such as the poor finances of the 
MSEB and the subsidies that it provides are brought into the picture. These 
are issues that do need to be addressed but they are distinct from the 
problems caused by expensive DPC power. Even if the failings of the MSEB are 
dealt with it would not lighten the burden that the DPC now imposes on the 
two Governments, the economy of Maharashtra and eventually on the national 
economy as well.

A
Dizzying offers create deregulation muddle
MIRIAM MOYNIHAN
Staff

04/14/2001
Houston Chronicle
3 STAR
1
(Copyright 2001)

One company is trying to lure Houstonians away from Reliant Energy HL&P with 
free electricity for the next two Decembers. 
Another competitor offers a $25 credit to sign up.
A third company doesn't offer any particular incentive. 
So far, four retail ventures - The New Power Co., First Choice Power, Green 
Mountain Energy Co. and Shell Energy Co. - are offering lower rates for 
customers of HL&P. But a consumer can get lost trying to pick the best one. 
A close look suggests that the company with the plainest offer may be the 
best deal for consumers fearing all the unknowns. But it depends. 
Welcome to electric deregulation. 
Texans are getting their first taste of how competition will be when the 
deregulation law goes fully into effect on Jan. 1. So far, the results of the 
pilot program show it needs work. Price information is hard to come by, the 
promotions can be confusing and the potential savings may not add up to much. 
With the sign-up period under way for the Texas Electric Choice pilot 
program, for the first time Houston consumers can choose from which company 
they'll buy electricity. It's important that new competitors win over lots of 
customers, because in the future, electric rates in Texas will be based on 
competition rather than regulation. 
In the newspaper, on television and on the Internet, ads are urging consumers 
to sign up by phone or online and trim painfully high electric bills. 
The simplest way to break down the cost is by looking at the average cost per 
thousand kilowatt-hours. A bit of multiplication shows that at Reliant's 
average current rate - 10.13 cents per kwh - 2,000 kilowatt hours would cost 
$202.60. So Shell's rate of 9.3 cents would save a consumer nearly $15 a 
month. 
But shoppers looking to dump Reliant must wrestle with a lot of unknowns. The 
actual savings will be affected by future rate changes, monthly fees and 
special offers by the providers. 
And getting the details to answer those questions can be difficult, said 
Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analyst at the Austin office of Consumers 
Union. 
""They're being very vague in what they can promise,"" she said. 
There is a lot of information out there if you have a telephone, an Internet 
connection and a few hours to kill. 
But keep your calculator handy. A representative of Shell Energy wasn't able 
to do the math when asked how much 2,367 kilowatt-hours would cost during 
August. 
Also, be wary of promises that sound too good to be true. 
A telephone representative from New Power gave a series of rates radically 
lower than the other companies, but the fuel charge - a considerable part of 
the cost - wasn't included in the price. When asked if that had been 
included, the representative didn't seem to know what it was. 
Business customers in Houston have signed up in droves for the nonresidential 
portion of the pilot program. 
But so far, this test of deregulation hasn't been a big hit with Houston 
consumers. Retail electricity providers have drawn 25,625 residential 
customers away from HL&P, according to the latest figures from the Texas 
Public Utility Commission. That's about 42 percent of the goal officials are 
seeking for the pilot. 
Much as competing long-distance phone providers sell their services using 
lines that are already there, beginning June 1, retail electricity companies 
will run power through HL&P's existing lines and pay a fee to the 
investor-owned utility. 
Since the new providers don't have the cost of maintaining poles, wires and 
other facilities, they can offer lower prices per kilowatt- hour - the 
industry benchmark meaning the amount of energy needed to light a 100-watt 
light bulb for 10 hours. 
""We can purchase the electricity using our size and global strength on the 
market at a much lower rate than the utility can charge,"" said Patricia Betz, 
marketing manager for Shell Energy, an affiliate of Shell Oil Co. 
But consumers need to understand that since it hasn't been done before in 
Houston, it carries some risk. 
""There's no guarantee that everything will work right,"" said Briesemeister. 
""The companies need to do a better job of saying that."" 
""That's why it's called a pilot. And it serves an important function - to see 
if everything works,"" she said. 
Making apples-to-apples price comparisons is difficult. 
The Public Utility Commission's Web site on the pilot program - 
www.powertochoose.org - recommends that consumers check the Electricity Facts 
Label of each program. But to find that item you need to go to the Terms and 
Conditions section of each company's Web site. 
In some cases, the prices posted there aren't the same as what's quoted by 
company officials over the phone because the prices on the Web are adjusted 
to include the added cost of the monthly fee. 
But the most straightforward offering comes from Shell Energy. 
It is quoting a flat rate of 9.3 cents per kilowatt-hour year- round. Its 
monthly service charge is $2 or $5, depending on the method of payment. Shell 
Energy doesn't require a contract and is also staying away from special 
incentives. 
""Electricity pricing is complicated,"" said Betz. ""We're trying to make it as 
simple as possible for consumers to understand."" 
But there's nothing simple about it. 
""If they want to compare apples to apples, look at the Electricity Facts 
Label, because they have to determine that in the exact same way,"" said 
Carrie Collier, a legislative analyst at the Public Utility Commission. ""We 
can't tell them how to market their electricity, but . . . what we've told 
them is that they have to provide standardized information for customers."" 
So, what exactly are they promising? 
""We'll always be cheaper than the utility,"" said Betz of Shell. 
She said the company does not foresee raising the rate during the pilot 
program, but it's not a guarantee because rising fuel costs could mean higher 
rates. 
""We're all subject to the same market forces,"" Betz said, ""so it's possible 
your rates will go up."" 
First Choice Power, an affiliate of Texas-New Mexico Power Co., is offering a 
rate of 9.4 cents per kilowatt-hour, with a $4.95 monthly service charge. 
""The offer is good for the life of the pilot,"" said Jim Niewald, First 
Choice's director of marketing. But he doesn't know how prices will be 
affected after that. 
His company requires a contract and gives a $25 credit on the first bill. It 
also plans contests to give away plane tickets, cash and T-shirts. 
Green Mountain Energy Co.'s rate is a bit higher - 9.8 cents per 
kilowatt-hour plus $4.95 a month - but the company is touting wind- powered 
energy. 
""We're the only clean-power option in Houston,"" said Gillan Taddune, vice 
president of Texas region. ""And I think that's definitely a benefit."" 
The New Power Co. - a marketing joint venture of Enron Corp., AOL and IBM - 
has two plans. One is a fixed rate of 9.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
That company is offering free Decembers for two years but has a $30 
cancellation fee if a customer chooses to switch before the contract ends. 
But that rate, confirmed by the company's Web site, was far different from 
the one quoted by phone recently. 
A New Power customer service representative quoted a price of 4.5 cents for 
up to 250 kwh from May through October, and 7.1 cents after that. And for 
November through April, the price quoted was 4.2 cents. 
The real rate is higher because the representative hadn't included the fuel 
charge of 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour that is added on. 
One reason consumers should consider their options is that the rates from 
Reliant will be going up again soon. The utility company - whose rate now 
starts at 9.75 cents per kilowatt-hour - is in the process of getting a rate 
increase to cover higher fuel costs approved by the PUC. 
""We're hoping to have interim rates in place by the end of April,"" said 
Reliant spokeswoman Leticia Lowe. 
The PUC has the power to review whether this fuel price adjustment is 
justified, though these requests usually go through with little change. 
Reliant's deregulated competitors do not have their rates reviewed by state 
regulators. 
But starting Jan. 1, when the deregulation law takes effect, Reliant will be 
able to drop its base rate by 6 percent. 
""In the pilot, consumers are comparing current rates,"" said Briesemeister. 
But down the line, the utility will get more competitive, she said. 
While up to 5 percent of residences currently served by Reliant can sign up, 
industry experts are unsure if that many will actually participate. 
""Residential customers traditionally are slower to enter the market,"" said 
Collier. ""The dollar incentive is greater if your bills are higher. For that 
reason, the industrial customer has more incentive to switch."" 
Janet Tuttle of Katy has taken the leap and signed with Shell. She heard 
about the pilot program on the evening news. 
""I've got two in college,"" she said, ""so I'm trying to cut the costs wherever 
I can.""

Enron controversy to dampen investor confidence in India: envoy

04/14/2001
Agence France-Presse
(Copyright 2001)

NEW DELHI, April 14 (AFP) - A controversy over US energy giant Enron's 
subsidiary in India will dampen investor confidence and have a negative 
impact on foreign investment, Washington's outgoing ambassador said Saturday. 
In an interview published in the Economic Times, Richard Celeste said the 
treatment of the subsidiary, Dabhol Power Corporation (DPC), ""will have a 
substantial (negative) impact on large investors.""
The DPC, the single largest foreign investment project in India, has been 
mired in controversy since its inception. 
The deal was signed in 1993, but was scrapped in 1995 by the state's newly 
installed Hindu nationalist government. 
The project was renegotiated the same year and work began for the first phase 
of the project, which began generating 714 megawatts of electricity in 1999. 
Construction for phase 2 is ongoing, but opposition to the project has 
resurfaced over the cost of electricity, with the Maharashtra state chief 
minister Vilasrao Deshmukh saying that the government was being billed almost 
8.00 rupees (18 US cents) per kilowatt hour for the electricity produced by 
Enron. 
Earlier this year, the cash-strapped Maharashtra electricity board said it 
could no longer meet payments due to DPC. 
This led to the DPC invoking a counter guarantee clause in the agreement, 
after which part of its dues were recovered. 
With a susbtantial portion of its dues still unrecovered, the DPC this week, 
invoked a ""force majeure"" notice. 
The notice warned that it maybe be unable for the company to perform its 
contractual obligations, due to the ""concerted, deliberate and politically 
motivated actions"" of the state and federal government as well as the 
Maharashtra electricity board. 
Urging the government to create an adequate environment for investors, 
Celeste warned: ""The (DPC) problem will have a large impact on India's 
ability to raise large amounts of capital.""

Pacific Gas & Electric owes us $570 million, Enron says

Copyright (c) 2001 Deseret News Publishing Co.

HOUSTON (AP) -- Enron Corp. says the utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co. owes 
the energy company $570 million, according to a letter to the utility's 
bankruptcy trustee. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman in Houston, said the company has taken 
adequate reserves to protect its balance sheet against any outstanding debts 
owed it by Pacific Gas & Electric.
But Enron's disclosure was the first indication of how much the West Coast 
utility owes the Houston company. 
Enron was one of the companies named late Wednesday to the creditors' 
committee for San Francisco-based Pacific Gas & Electric's Chapter 11 
bankruptcy case. The committee represents the parties with the largest claims 
in a bankruptcy case. 
Enron officials cited the utility's unpaid debt to secure a seat on the 
committee appointed by U.S. Trustee Linda Stanley, a Justice Department 
official. 
A week ago, Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection because 
negotiations with California over how to resolve the state's power crisis 
were going nowhere. Pacific Gas & Electric sells electricity and natural gas 
to the San Francisco and Northern California areas. 
Earlier this week, a federal judge ordered Enron to keep supplying low-cost 
power to California's state university systems after Enron tried to shift 
responsibility for buying the school's power to the state's troubled 
utilities.

WASHINGTON - When then-candidate George W. Bush needed a plane to shuttle his 
staff around on the campaign trail, corporations scrambled to offer up their 
private jets. 
The Bush camp was eager to fly the friendly skies of Enron Corp.
When former Secretary of State James A. Baker III was out of a job at the end 
of the first Bush administration, Houston-based Enron had some consulting 
work waiting. 
And when then-President Clinton, ex-President Ford and golfing legend Jack 
Nicklaus needed a fourth, Enron Chairman Ken Lay was available to play a 
round of 18 holes. 
Here, in a town where access to the political elite is everything, Enron is 
master of the game. 
Other companies contribute to political campaigns, hire former insiders and 
hobnob with politicos, but few do so on a par with Enron. 
""They get it,"" noted Andrew Wheat, research director for Texans for Public 
Justice, an Austin-based watchdog group and frequent Enron critic. ""They 
understand how it works and . . . how things get done, both here and abroad. 
""I can't think of another company in Texas that compares."" 
In part, Enron's political smarts are an outgrowth of the company's business 
strategy, to be first in an emerging market even as the rules of the game are 
being formulated. 
The company's shrewdness also is a reflection of Lay's own personality, his 
experience in government and his affinity for politics. 
And now, thanks to his longtime association with - and munificent 
contributions to - President Bush, Lay is the envy of corporate America. 
Access to decision-makers in both parties, however, does not always translate 
into favorable decisions. Enron's recent lobbying efforts have yielded rather 
mixed results. 
Consider: 
The new Bush administration has taken a largely hands-off approach to the 
electricity crisis in California, heeding the advice of power wholesaler and 
marketer Enron. But Enron's broader objective, national deregulation of the 
power industry, remains stalled on Capitol Hill. 
Enron officials support the Republicans' vision of a smaller federal 
government. But the Bush White House has proposed whacking the budgets of two 
federal agencies Enron has relied upon repeatedly, the Export-Import Bank of 
the United States and the Overseas Private Investment Corp. 
Bush, much to Lay's surprise, pledged to try to force power plants to curb 
their carbon-dioxide emissions, the main greenhouse gas implicated in global 
warming. That policy could have created a vast growth market for Enron, whose 
business benefits from construction of more natural-gas-fired plants that 
emit less carbon dioxide. But last month, Bush flip-flopped on that promise. 
According to all conventional wisdom inside the capital Beltway, Enron should 
not be suffering political setbacks now. 
Lay, a former Naval officer and one-time energy policy-maker during the Nixon 
administration, is one of Bush's longest and staunchest supporters. 
An ally of the elder George Bush, Lay worked closely with George W. Bush 
during the Republican National Convention in Houston in 1992, when Lay 
co-chaired the host committee. They met up again during the site-selection 
process for the senior Bush's presidential library. 
As the younger Bush became a force first in Texas and then in national 
politics, Lay and other Enron officials emerged as perhaps the biggest 
contributors of his political career. By July 1999, with Bush's run for the 
presidency just getting under way, Enron officials had already contributed 
more than $550,000 to him, according to the Center for Public Integrity. 
Bush and Lay never became fishing buddies or bird-hunting pals. But then-Gov. 
Bush did appoint Lay to head his governor's business council. 
And he dubbed Lay with a series of nicknames, including ""Kenny Boy."" 
Lay didn't forget Bush during the presidential race. He was one of the 214 
Bush ""Pioneers,"" supporters who raised at least $100,000 for the candidate, 
and also ponied up cash for Bush's Florida recount battle. 
For the inaugural festivities, Lay, Enron Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and 
the corporation itself each contributed the maximum $100,000. 
But Lay says he didn't contribute so heavily to Bush in the hopes of getting 
something out of him. Instead, he believed in him as a candidate. 
""He's smart,"" Lay said. ""He's got good values. He's got family values. . . . 
He's a man of character and integrity, just like his father."" 
Bush also shares Lay's vision of deregulated, competitive markets. ""My basic 
philosophy is very much in tune with his basic philosophy,"" Lay said. 
After the election, Lay was frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for 
both energy and Treasury secretary. He has also been advising the Bush team 
on energy policy. 
Lay's political star, however, didn't rise just with Bush's relocation from 
Austin to Washington. 
Despite his strong GOP credentials, Lay was a frequent visitor at the Clinton 
White House, helping to host the Brazilian president, advising the Democratic 
administration on trade policy and brainstorming on global warming. 
Lay was on good terms with all three Treasury secretaries under Clinton - 
Lloyd Bentsen, Robert Rubin and Larry Summers - as well as White House Chief 
of Staff Thomas ""Mack"" McLarty and former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson. 
To handle the day-to-day political work, Enron doesn't hesitate to hire some 
of the heaviest hitters on the political scene. 
The company's list of political consultants has included: Bill Paxon, a 
former conservative leader in the House; Ralph Reed, one- time head of the 
Christian Coalition; former Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., and Elizabeth 
""Betsy"" Moler, former chairwoman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
and one-time deputy energy secretary. 
The company's board of directors includes Wendy Gramm, former head of the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission and wife of Senate Banking Committee 
Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and John Wakeham, Britain's former energy 
minister. 
Back in the early 1990s, within weeks of the end of the first Bush 
administration, Enron hired Baker and former Commerce Secretary Robert 
Mosbacher. 
The move sparked controversy when Baker, who as secretary of state had helped 
forge the international coalition that expelled Iraqi troops from Kuwait, was 
visiting a liberated Kuwait lobbying on Enron's behalf. 
Government watchdogs have long decried the ""revolving door"" between top 
government jobs and the corporate world. Wheat of Texans for Public Justice 
said Enron keeps that door ""spinning."" 
More recently, Enron angered right-wing partisans on Capitol Hill when it 
hired Linda Robertson, a former assistant Treasury secretary in the Clinton 
administration and a Democrat, to run the company's Washington office. 
Lay is not apologetic. 
""We don't discriminate based upon color or creed or race or religion or sex,"" 
Lay said. ""We also don't discriminate based upon political preference."" 
Unlike many other companies, which are shy of government involvement, Enron 
does not hesitate to use the resources of the federal government to boost 
exports and win contracts overseas. 
Commerce secretaries, for example, routinely take U.S. businesses on 
international road shows, hoping to use Uncle Sam's political influence to 
win business for American firms. During the Clinton years, Enron executives 
accompanied commerce secretaries on at least seven such trips, government 
records show. 
The Overseas Private Investment Corp. provides political risk insurance and 
project financing to U.S. companies doing business overseas. Enron has been 
one of the agency's biggest customers. 
And since the end of the Cold War, U.S. diplomats have become much more 
involved in advocating for American firms. 
While other companies have been slow to seek out the State Department's help, 
""Enron was in step with that change,"" noted McLarty, a former 
natural-gas-company executive and an expert on Latin American trade. 
Closer to home, deregulation of the electric-power industry tops the 
company's domestic political agenda. 
To date, electricity deregulation has progressed piecemeal, state by state. 
Bills in Congress to deregulate the industry nationwide have gone nowhere. 
Enron officials were able to enlist the support of the Clinton 
administration, but the legislation failed to move on Capitol Hill, largely 
because of personalities and turf issues. 
""It didn't come to fruition, not because of Enron but because of a lack of 
leadership on the issue, particularly in the House,"" said Moler, the former 
Energy Regulatory Commission chairwoman. ""Enron was very effective, even 
though they didn't get the ball across the finish line, in terms of 
advocating a pro-competition agenda."" 
Now, there's a new Congress and a new occupant of the Oval Office, a 
pro-competition advocate who oversaw the deregulation of the Texas power 
market. 
But Enron's hopes of a national deregulation bill dimmed as the lights 
flickered out in California. 
While energy experts can think of numerous reasons why California's energy 
crisis was largely of its own making, the rolling blackouts there have caused 
other states to slow their deregulation efforts for fear of similar troubles. 
Even politically savvy Enron may have a tough time pulling out a victory from 
those ashes.

BUSINESS
THE NEW POWER / Enron / Making of the Market-maker / Pipeline operator 
evolved into player that keeps raising bar

AT ENRON CORP., it came to be known as the ""Come to Jesus"" meeting. 
This gathering in late 1988 had nothing to do with religion, but everything 
to do with a leap of faith.
Top management, about 70 in all, met to find out where their company was 
headed. They were told to expect a big change. 
At the meeting led by Rich Kinder, who would soon become Enron's president, 
they were briefed on the company's new strategy. Like the unredeemed at a 
revival meeting, the leaders of the then-stodgy natural gas pipeline company 
were told they had to change their ways. 
Rather than stick to only the safe and highly regulated gas pipeline 
business, Enron officials were about to stake their company's future on the 
unregulated part of the business and look for opportunities worldwide. 
""The decision was made that we needed to move quickly,"" said Ken Lay, Enron 
chairman. ""And if we were going to be a leader, we were going to have to go 
after it. If not, other people would."" 
The gravity of the moment was not lost on those present. These veterans of 
the regulated pipeline business were now working for a company that was 
heading into uncharted territory. Many in the room would be gone from the 
company within months, replaced by younger executives who were more open to 
change. 
""They may talk about it casually now, but at the time they were sweating 
bullets,"" said Robert Bruner, executive director of the Batten Institute at 
the University of Virginia, who teaches a case study on Enron's evolution to 
executives. 
The company has made its mark by being in the vanguard of change. Since that 
fateful meeting in the late 1980s, it has shown over and over again that it 
has a knack for knowing when to exit a declining market and move on to the 
next one. 
Now the the pipeline business has moved into the background at Enron. Enron 
now profits mainly by making it easier to buy and sell things that otherwise 
would be difficult to market - a process the company calls ""making markets."" 
""They have shown they can trade almost anything and have a compelling need to 
dominate any market they go into,"" said John Olson, an energy analyst with 
Sanders Morris Harris in Houston. ""They do it with a sort of Gulf War 
military doctrine of using overwhelming force, technology and people, going 
in with a blitzkrieg to get the best of the market and move on."" 
That statement could serve as a summation of Enron's business strategy during 
its period of explosive growth that made it the first Houston-based company 
to post annual revenues of $100 billion a year. Most of the time the approach 
has paid off, with only a few major missteps. 
Enron has been in the forefront of sea changes numerous times, and not just 
in the energy industry. 
When Houston Natural Gas was bought by InterNorth, creating Enron, it formed 
the first nationwide interstate natural gas pipeline system. 
The company created the first futures market for natural gas with its Gas 
Bank - allowing users to buy and sell gas for future delivery - years ahead 
of the first futures contract to trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
It also developed many of the methods of hedging natural gas costs that are 
used today to reduce the risk of price swings. 
Enron's pipeline was the first system to offer its interstate pipeline to 
transport anyone's gas for a fee. Now, all interstate pipelines are run in 
that fashion. 
The company's $2 billion power plant project in India is the largest single 
outside investment ever made in that country. 
The company moved quickly to become a player when California lawmakers voted 
to open that state to electricity supplier competition, and soon changed its 
plans to limits its risks there. In 1996, Enron became the first natural gas 
pipeline company to buy an electric utility, Portland General Electric in 
Portland, Ore. 
Enron OnLine, the company's Internet trading site at enrononline.com, has, in 
only a year or so of operation, become the largest e-commerce site in the 
world. 
Now, Enron makes 80 percent of its profits from businesses that did not exist 
in 1988, the huge wholesale markets that have developed for natural gas and 
electricity-marketing, broadband, fiber-optic and energy services. 
""It seems like they do everything,"" said David Nemtzow, president of the 
Alliance to Save Energy, a nonprofit energy conservation group. ""$100 billion 
(in annual revenues) is nothing to sneeze at. Exxon Mobil was founded by John 
Rockefeller, Enron's only been around for 15 years."" 
Enron still trails Exxon in size, since the biggest company in the oil 
business had $233 billion in revenues last year, and it is not be as well 
known as John D. Rockefeller. 
But its influence is becoming almost as pervasive as his once was. 
The company was one of the largest contributors to the campaign of President 
Bush and Lay is considered one of the president's closest private-sector 
advisers on energy policy. He is personal friends with both the president and 
his father. 
The company has equally strong ties to Democrats, including access to former 
President Clinton. 
But at the same time, Enron's role in deregulation in the United States and 
globalization have made it a target for protesters who blame private energy 
companies for the deregulation fiasco in California and U.S. multinationals 
for a wide array of troubles overseas. 
And the company which has been leader in this business, is regularly racing 
against a pack of competitors, including Houston- based El Paso Corp. Reliant 
and and Dynegy. 
Kinder, who declined to be interviewed for this story, left when it became 
apparent he wouldn't become CEO and started his own energy company Kinder 
Morgan. 
""You really can't copyright or patent this sort of stuff,"" said Jeffrey 
Skilling, Enron's chief executive officer.""This is like an arms race where 
the arms are brains. You need smart people that are constantly thinking up 
the next things the customer needs. 
""What a change from the gas business 25 years ago, when the whole name of the 
game was good regulatory lawyers,"" Skilling said. 
Now, its future depends on a continuing willingness to take chances on new 
things, and when things aren't working, to spend what it takes to change 
them. 
""Maybe that's a lesson we all learned: There is usually no second best; it's 
winner take all and you better get in there and you better fight your best 
battle because it's pretty hard to play catch-up,"" Skilling said. 
... 
Surviving the culture clash 
The executives who were called to the Come to Jesus meeting already had 
survived three years of tumult. 
Even Ken Lay, who was behind that message, had his doubts about the whole 
enterprise in the beginning. He was there because of a contract he had signed 
that he likened to having his hands glued to the steering wheel. 
The merger of Omaha, Neb.-based InterNorth and Houston-based Houston Natural 
Gas created a company that was mired in debt and had to battle corporate 
raiders. The employees from the companies that formed Enron clashed as well. 
""That first year after the merger was kind of interesting,"" Lay said, in a 
characteristic understatement. He described the corporate culture battle in 
those early years as ""bloody."" 
Bill Brendler, an organizational psychologist who was brought in to help 
combine the companies' cultures, recalls going to Omaha after the merger and 
not hearing anyone refer to the new company as Enron. All of the InterNorth 
people were still calling the company by its former name. 
""It was kind of gut wrenching to them, like they had been sold out,"" said 
Brendler, who operates a consulting company based in Austin. 
The merger had left the new company with a mountain of debt. It was one of 
the first big junk bond mergers engineered by Michael Milken. 
The company's financial woes got even worse around Christmas 1985, when the 
Peruvian government nationalized all of the company's oil and gas properties 
in that country, depriving Enron of its main sources of cash flow. 
Then, in January 1986, oil prices collapsed from $30 per barrel to $10. 
To add to the company's problems, it came under fire from raider Irwin 
Jacobs, who led a group that held about 15 percent of Enron's stock. 
In a bid to fend off Jacobs' group, Enron considered going private. They 
turned to one of the most high-profile takeover partnerships of the time, 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., to look into financing a deal to buy all its 
publicly traded shares. That deal came, ""very, very close,"" Lay said. 
Eventually, the company ended the takeover threat by buying back Jacobs's 
shares. 
All this was going on as the company's top management was in a state of flux. 
Lay was named chief executive officer in November 1985 and elected chairman 
in a February board meeting that he still recalls vividly today. Lay had 
recommended that Bill Strauss, former InterNorth chairman and chief executive 
officer, come on as chairman. 
""I thought it would sort of pull the teams together,"" Lay said. ""He could 
give me air cover in Omaha."" 
In retrospect, Lay said, his recommendation probably heightened the battle 
between the rival groups of employees. Strauss, too, soon realized that there 
was room at the top for only one. 
Before the company's February 1986 board meeting in Winter Park, Fla., 
Strauss had persuaded Lay to tear up his contract with a golden parachute, 
which would have paid him handsomely if he left the company, in return for 
incentives in stock options. 
""He wanted to make sure I was committed to the company and I was because I 
had no choice,"" Lay said. ""They sort of glued my hands to the steering 
wheel."" 
Strauss called the board meeting to order and resigned on the spot, stunning 
Lay and everyone else in the room. He recommended the board elect Lay 
chairman and CEO. 
He then said, ""I'll see you around,"" walked out of the room, drove to the 
airport and caught a flight back to Omaha. 
After about 30 seconds of silence, one of the former InterNorth directors 
nominated Lay to be chairman, another seconded it and they voted on it. 
""There I was,"" Lay said, laughing. ""Just totally prepared for it."" 
... 
Learning from near-disaster 
Enron took the leap into the volatile world of deregulated energy markets in 
spite of a trading fiasco that could have pushed the company to the brink of 
bankruptcy. 
In 1987, Enron was rocked by the disclosure that rogue traders at its Enron 
Oil Co. had left the company holding the bag for about $1 billion in trading 
liabilities. Before disclosing it to the market, the company worked the 
trading loss down to about $142 million. 
The experience was one Lay and others at the company would not forget. But 
rather than losing faith in making markets, this was a lesson that shaped the 
way the company is run. 
""We learned a lot, certainly in a bad way,"" Lay said. ""We put in place 
probably the best risk management and control system, not just in our 
business, but in any industry."" 
The company has become a leader in developing risk management strategies, 
offering hedges on everything from weather derivatives to advertising space. 
Many of these techniques were developed during the late 1980s with the 
guidance of a former consultant at McKinsey & Co., Jeffrey Skilling. 
It was Skilling, among others, who came up with the idea for Enron to create 
The Gas Bank, a unique concept of packaging natural gas supplies so they 
could be bought on a long-term basis for fixed prices to suit an individual 
customer's needs. 
""It was the first forward pricing structure for natural gas,"" Skilling said. 
The idea was to gather gas supplies on one end of the pipeline, customers on 
the other, and then put together deals to serve both sides' needs. 
It worked like this. From the overall production of a well or field, the 
company would sell parts of the production to different customers - an 
industrial customer might buy a portion of the production for a year, while a 
local gas distribution company might buy a share of the production for two or 
three years, and a power producer might buy a 10-year supply. At the time, 
power producers were desperate to get long-term, fixed-price supplies of 
natural gas. 
""It was very successful for us and it made it clear that there was a whole 
new way of thinking about this business,"" Skilling said. ""We were creating a 
forward market in 1988,"" he said, describing that year as ""a magical time."" 
The company began developing package deals for its customers. One of the 
first major customers was Peoples Gas Co., the utility company that serves 
Chicago, which traditionally had relied on a huge supply organization. 
""They were buying capacity on pipelines and in storage fields, buying gas 
from producers with a massive organization,"" Skilling said. ""We went to them 
and said, give us all of that stuff, we'll manage it for you. Then all you 
have to do is call us in the morning and tell us how much gas you need and we 
will have it ready."" 
From The Gas Bank, Enron eventually set up Enron Gas Marketing, and they 
started bidding, mainly on spot transactions. It was the genesis of Enron's 
massive wholesale trading operations today. 
It was also around this time that the company began to move into energy 
financing. After the bust of 1986, banks had pulled out of the energy lending 
business and Enron believed it could make money by filling that void. 
What had begun as a gas marketing unit also was now engaged in venture 
finance. Enron Gas Marketing became Enron Capital and Trade Resources, with 
Skilling at the helm. He later would become head of Enron North America, over 
all of the company's domestic operations. 
When Enron's natural gas wholesale business began, there were about 70 
employees. Now, including power sales, there are 5,000. 
""We always kidded that Enron Capital and Trade Resources sounded kind of 
complicated, but no matter what we named it, within six months, everyone else 
in the industry had one just like it,"" Lay said. 
... 
Portrait of Ugly American 
Enron's foray into unregulated overseas markets has been largely successful, 
but when it has gone bad, it has gone very bad. 
The company has built some of the largest power projects and pipeline systems 
in international markets over the past 10 years or so, but in the process it 
often has been portrayed as the Ugly American corporation by critics who 
accuse it of spreading around payoffs and showing little regard for human 
rights or the environment. 
Enron has responded that those allegations are unfounded, but has made 
changes in its international business that have moved it away from those 
confrontations. 
It began testing its plan to build an international business in 1988, when it 
established an operation to build gas-fired electric generating plants in the 
United Kingdom as that country's electricity markets were privatized. 
""We were beginning to get a little momentum from the standpoint of stepping 
outside of our regulated business in North America and even stepping outside 
of North America a little bit,"" Lay said. ""But we still had to demonstrate 
that we could do it without great risk. That was a fairly important part of 
those early days."" 
As Enron branched out into international markets, the executive who took the 
international reins was a woman who stood out in the largely male domain of 
the energy business. Her name was Rebecca Mark. 
Mark, who declined to be interviewed for this story, became one of the stars 
at Enron after she successfully saw through to completion the company's 
controversial Dabhol power plant project in India. 
Enron bought a 65 percent share in the Dabhol Power Co. back in the early 
1990s. Enron believed it could replicate the success it had had in England 
with its massive Teesside power plant in the United Kingdom. 
The political landscape in India, however, proved to be far more daunting. 
The $2.9 billion project became a political nightmare for Enron. After a 
change in the ruling party, the project was halted amid accusations that 
Enron had a sweetheart deal with the previous regime to build the plant. 
That standoff led to construction delays at the huge project that were 
costing Enron a small fortune. Mark got the job of leading the effort to 
renegotiate the deal to get the plant construction back on schedule. 
In an interview she gave in early 1997, Mark said ""People thought we were 
pushy and aggressive. But think of the massive bureaucracy we had to move. 
How do you move a bureaucracy that has done things one way its entire 
collective life? You have to be pushy and aggressive."" 
Adding to the project's bureaucratic difficulties were mass protests from 
nearby villagers. Enron was accused of human rights abuses because of the 
tactics used by local police the company hired as security. 
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International accused Enron's security guards 
of beating villagers who protested the project. 
Enron said the accusations about human rights abuses in a report released in 
early 1999 were false. In the wake of those allegations, Enron hired a human 
rights director to handle concerns at its global operations. 
Eventually, Mark renegotiated the deal and phase one of the plant was 
completed and went into operation. This victory gained her international 
attention and led to her being named vice chairwoman at Enron. 
But she gained attention largely because of the business she had chosen for 
her career. She was a single mother who had risen to the top in the energy 
business. Enron liked to portray her as evidence that it was a new kind of 
energy company in which everyone had a chance to prosper. 
As a rising star, Mark was tapped to head up the company's effort to get into 
the international water utility business. 
It would prove to be her undoing as Enron shifted from owning lots of 
physical assets, which was the side of the business where Mark had made her 
name, and into its so-called asset-lite strategy. 
The problems she dealt with in India have not been resolved; they have 
resurfaced in another form. The company is not getting paid for power because 
it's said to be too expensive. 
Enron officials maintain that they are sticking behind the project, even 
going so far as to warn Indian politicians that taking on Enron will be ""like 
playing chicken with a brick wall."" 
But analysts question how long they can last. 
""Clearly India has been a political hot potato,"" for Enron, said Carl Kirst, 
an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities in Houston.""They've continued 
to put one foot in front of another against almost gale-force winds. 
Sometimes it's not worth the uphill battle."" 
The company is reportedly looking to sell its stake in the Dabhol project to 
either Reliance, one of India's largest industrial concerns, or China Light 
and Power Co. There is some doubt as to whether the project would command 
full value given all of the political problems at the plant. 
An Indian observer is more blunt on the subject. 
""India is not a place where their fortunes lie,"" says analyst Subhash 
Agarwal, editor of India Focus, a political risk magazine. 
... 
The power of electricity 
Once Enron had become a dominant player in the unregulated natural gas 
business, the company set its sites on a new market: electricity. 
It was in many ways much more of a gamble than the company's move into 
unregulated natural gas markets. The electricity business was even more 
entrenched in regulation than gas had been. And it was being deregulated in a 
piecemeal fashion, state by state, instead of through a federal regulatory 
process like the one that covered gas. 
Yet when describing it, Lay makes it sound simple. 
""We just took the model that Jeff and his team developed in the early 1990s 
for wholesale North American natural gas and began to move it out to other 
markets."" Lay said. 
In 1997, the company made its first major move on domestic electricity 
markets when it bought Portland General Corp., the parent company of Portland 
General Electric, the utility serving Portland, Ore. 
The purchase gave the company a beachhead into the soon-to-be- opening 
California market and a marketing arm on the West Coast. 
Three years after buying Portland General, though, the nation's electricity 
markets had changed to the point where Enron decided to sell the electric 
company. 
The company realized it no longer needed an electric utility to be a major 
player. It was another of many lessons for Enron that making markets, not 
owning physical assets, was where its future lay. 
In many ways, Enron's experience in California has been a textbook example of 
how they quickly move out of a market when an investment is not living up to 
expectations. 
In California, the company avoided getting involved in that state's energy 
crisis because it chose not to buy power plants there, but rather stick to 
offering services and selling power on the wholesale markets. 
""Because it does not own generation in the region, Enron is not forced into 
power trades with the utilities the way the California wholesale generators 
have been,"" said Jeff Dietert, analyst with Simmons & Company International 
in Houston. 
The company realized soon after the California market opened in March 1998 
that the legal framework was flawed and was a recipe for disaster. 
""When we entered California, we were still trying to change the rules so 
competition could take hold; we were not successful,"" Lay said. ""At the end 
of the day, it was set up in a way that the more you sold, the more you 
lost."" 
But the recent filing of Chapter 11 bankruptcy by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., 
has drawn Enron into the crisis in a big way. The company disclosed last week 
that it is owed $570 million by the bankrupt utility. Enron has been named to 
the creditors committee for the case. 
Rather than restrict their power business to individual states or regions, 
the company last year decided the time had come for a national effort to 
enter opening power and gas markets. 
Enron formed a nationwide power and natural gas retail marketing company 
catering to residential and small-business customers named The New Power Co. 
The company is a joint venture of Enron, IBM and AOL Time Warner. 
The concept of the joint venture is for Enron to provide natural gas and 
electricity as a commodity, IBM to provide technical support and service, and 
AOL to provide an Internet platform to market the service nationwide. 
But less than a year after the company was formed, its concept is already 
outdated. It has become apparent that the role that AOL was expected to play 
in marketing the service is not needed; most of the sales so far have 
happened over the telephone as a result of direct- mail solicitations. 
""AOL is a problem,"" said Gene Lockhart, chief executive of The New Power Co. 
""We are not a dot-com. About 70 percent of our sales come through traditional 
channels."" 
The intended role of AOL in the joint venture ""just hasn't worked,"" Lockhart 
said. Now, the deal with AOL is being renegotiated as The New Power Co. 
establishes relationships with other Internet companies. 
Since its inception last year, The New Power Co. has grown rapidly and now 
has about 650,000 customers in 15 states. The company expects to finish the 
year with 1.2 million customers split about equally between natural gas and 
electricity, said Bill Jacobs, the chief financial officer for the company. 
The New Power Co. recently announced that it had signed up over 5,000 
residential electricity customers in Texas as part of the state's pilot 
program to test deregulation. 
""I think Texas is a market we will be able to enter from day one,"" Lay said. 
""Both with The New Power Co. for residential and Enron Energy Services for 
large customers."" 
... 
Broadening its horizons again 
When Enron bought Portland General, it picked up a new line of business - a 
telecommunications unit with only 25 employees that moved data over 
fiber-optic lines. 
From that tiny start, Enron is creating what it expects will someday grow 
into a venture that could rival its natural gas and electricity businesses. 
While electricity looked like a natural next step for Enron after natural 
gas, the business of trading space on broadband lines appeared on its face to 
be a different sort of animal. But after a second look, the company's traders 
noticed that the broadband business looked a lot like natural gas markets in 
the mid-1980s. 
In both cases, owners of lines were paid to deliver something. But buying and 
selling this valuable service was difficult because there were no 
standardized terms and conditions for contracts and no opportunity to buy or 
sell on a short notice. 
For businesses to ensure they had all the broadband capacity they needed 
during peak periods, they often had to pay for the capacity to send far more 
data than they needed. 
""We found even in the case of Enron, when we looked at our connections 
between Houston and London, the average load factor was only about 15 
percent,"" Lay said. ""It's close to 100 percent during peak days, peak hours, 
etc. But there were an awful lot of nonpeak periods when it was very low. We 
couldn't do anything with that extra capacity."" 
All of these elements combined to make a very inefficient business - which to 
Enron meant there were customers out there willing to pay someone to manage 
their broadband requirements. 
The broadband business reported a $60 million operating loss for 2000, and 
the company has warned analysts that it will continue losing money for the 
next two years or so as it builds its nationwide fiber-optic network. 
The company's broadband business suffered a setback recently when its deal to 
provide on-demand video with Blockbuster Video fell through. The cancellation 
of the 20-year deal means Enron's broadband business will have to go after 
smaller contracts, which could mean a longer time to expand the business. 
Losing the Blockbuster deal, and a staff reduction that reduced the broadband 
team by more than 20 percent, has not dampened company officials' enthusiasm, 
though they admit the growth may take longer than expected. 
""This is going to be a core business for us,"" Lay said. ""With this business, 
we will show that companies define themselves not by industry, but by skill 
base."" 
... 
Azurix turns into wash 
Undoubtedly, the biggest blunder Enron has made as it has grown away from 
being strictly an energy company was its misguided foray into the water 
business. 
It cost the company billions, confirmed the wisdom of the strategy to shift 
away from hard assets, and cost Rebecca Mark her job. 
Enron bought Britain's Wessex Water in 1998 for $2.8 billion to use as a 
platform to launch a worldwide water business. The plan was to take over 
formerly public water and wastewater facilities as they privatized as well as 
manage such facilities. Enron thought it could once again turn a mature 
regulated business into a growth machine. 
The move ran counter to the way the rest of the company was going. Enron was 
going to a strategy built around making markets, rather than ownership of big 
assets. This allowed it to grow faster using less capital. 
Enron turned to investors for capital to fuel its water venture, which was 
led by Mark and named Azurix. It went public in June 1999, selling about 
one-third of its shares to investors at $19 per share. 
But Azurix soon ran into fierce competition. Giant multinational rivals such 
as Vivendi and Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux outbid Azurix time and again for 
projects, forcing Azurix to pay more for some deals than they were worth. 
The real blow, however, came when regulators in England clamped down on water 
rates, depriving the company of its main source of cash flow. 
Azurix's shares plummeted 40 percent in December 1999 when the company said 
it would not make fourth-quarter expectations and was laying off much of its 
staff. 
Enron decided last summer that it was time to stop the bleeding. Mark 
resigned from Azurix and from her seat on Enron's board, severing ties to the 
company she had helped create. A few months later, Enron announced a plan to 
take the company private. 
""I am not sure if the strategy was flawed or if it was never given a chance,"" 
Lay said. ""Some of the operating assumptions didn't prove out, but this was 
never meant to be a long-term business for us. We thought we could transfer 
some of our skills into it."" 
Skilling, who was the champion of the company's market-driven business 
strategy, is a bit more blunt about the experience. 
""You win some, you lose some, "" he said. ""If you don't have some mistakes, it 
means you're not trying. I wish it wasn't as big a mistake as it was, but you 
can't win them all. 
... 
Making and creating markets 
The mantra at Enron nowadays is, ""We make markets."" 
The company is positioning itself to be a private-sector, online version of 
the New York Mercantile Exchange, offering traders an Internet platform to 
buy and sell a vast range of commodities as well as less tangible items such 
as emissions credits and weather hedges. 
Stock market observers are having an increasingly hard time figuring out how 
to value Enron's shares, which sometimes trade in tandem with technology 
stocks rather than energy stocks because of the growing broadband business. 
The University of Virginia's Bruner said the question he is most often asked 
when he teaches his Enron case study is whether the company can keep finding 
new businesses to enter to sustain its strong growth. His answer is yes. 
""I think their model can revitalize a wide variety of areas; I think Enron is 
going to be around for a long time,"" Bruner said. 
EnronOnline, the company's Internet trading platform is only about 18 months 
old but did some $330 billion in transactions last year, easily making it the 
largest e-commerce site in the world. 
The company has taken its risk-management skills and approach to buying and 
selling natural gas and electricity and moved it into the old-line businesses 
of steel and paper. 
""We make markets, but they have to have certain characteristics for us to be 
interested in those markets,"" Skilling said. 
The commodities Enron is interested in tend to have very complex, dedicated 
delivery systems, such as gas pipelines or fiber-optic data communications 
networks. It has to be a commodity with relatively long time frames involved. 
Examples would be when a producer drills a well or someone builds a power 
plant. Those are big capital investments with long-lived assets that are 
associated with the commodity. 
""They have morphed from saying they want to be the leading gas company to 
being the leading energy company to where there is now no industry definition 
that describes them,"" Bruner said. 
Skilling does not believe Enron will be that much different of a company five 
years from now, other than it likely will have expanded the roster of 
commodities it trades. 
But Lay still is expecting big changes. ""It will be a totally different 
company just like it is today versus five years ago,"" he said. ""As we sit 
here with what is on our plate today, we can see some very significant growth 
with several years to come. I am sure if we look back five years from now 
there will be at least one or two businesses with enormous potential in our 
portfolio that we have not even thought of yet.""

THE NEW POWER / Enron / Making of the Market-maker / With ups and downs, 
Enron Broadband is a work in progress

IN LATE 1999, when Enron announced it would pioneer trading of a ""new new"" 
commodity - Internet bandwidth - analysts and investors were only a little 
skeptical. 
Nevermind that buying and selling time on the vast, unruly tangle of the 
Internet on a big scale was unheard of. Enron's reputation for making a 
profit trading almost everything from pulp to plastics made this venture look 
like a sure thing.
When entertainment giant Blockbuster Video signed a deal with Enron last 
summer to provide video-on-demand service to consumers, creating content to 
fill that giant data pipeline, investors bid up the stock to show their 
confidence in its broadband vision. 
But when the Blockbuster deal was canceled on March 9, Enron stock fell back 
to earth. 
Things got worse when Wall Street got reports that Enron Broadband Services 
was reducing its staff by more then 20 percent - which have since been 
confirmed by the company. 
That news took a bit of the high-tech shine off the company at a time when 
Enron also was getting some bad news from its international operations and 
the market was losing its taste for high flying stocks. 
Suddenly, Enron's broadband business, which helped fuel the stock's rise last 
year, had become a drag. 
The potential for broadband services and trading isn't being disputed, but 
Andre Meade, head of U.S. utilities research for Commerzbank Securities, said 
many analysts were too quick to accept Enron's estimates on the value of the 
business when it was first announced. 
""The market priced in an excessive valuation on the broadband business, 
overreacting on something that was still relatively unknown,"" Meade said. 
""Now it's overreacted somewhat to the Blockbuster news. I think it's dropped 
lower than it should."" 
The trading side of the business appears to be exceeding expectations, but 
Enron Broadband is still expected to remain in the red for the next couple of 
years as it builds business. 
""I think we realize it's still a work in progress,"" Meade said. 
Enron Broadband first used its network for broadband hosting, letting a few 
large customers, such as TV networks or financial services companies, buy 
data line access on an as-needed basis for such things as Web broadcasts or 
shipping large amounts of data across the country, said Ken Rice, chief 
executive officer of Enron Broadband Services. 
In the past, if a company wanted to do a Web broadcast between two cities, 
for example, it had two choices: just do the broadcast and hope regular 
Internet traffic wouldn't slow it down or interfere with the quality, or 
reserve time on a data line months in advance and pay for several months 
worth of service, instead of just the time needed. 
""It seemed to be a business about the same size as natural gas, but growing 
by 15 to 20 percent per year,"" Rice said. ""By 1998, we decided that telecom 
could be the company's core business."" 
Enron's bold predictions were embraced by investors and analysts who had 
learned to give the company a lot of credit for its ability to successfully 
execute its business plan. That faith helped keep Enron's stock buoyant in 
the past year even as other companies with broadband businesses, such as 
Williams Cos. and Global Crossing, saw their operations lose more than half 
their value. 
Enron built its own fiber-optic network, which now runs about 18,000 miles. 
It used that to connect many other large networks around the world. To 
facilitate those connections, the company has created more than 25 ""pooling 
points"" where Enron's network interconnects with others, much like the Henry 
Hub in Louisiana connects many natural gas pipelines. 
It's at these pooling points where Enron can flip the switches on 
increasingly short notice to turn on a section of the network dedicated to a 
customer's needs. That lets Enron buy and sell just what the customer wants. 
Enron also created software that allows customers to reserve and schedule 
bandwidth and pick the quality of service. 
The company has seen trading grow quickly, jumping from 236 broadband trades 
in the fourth quarter of 2000 to more than 500 trades in the first quarter of 
2001. 
Enron also is moving closer to having the one tool that could really let 
trading take off - standardized contracts. That can be a hard sell. 
""Just as with the electricity and natural gas industries, a lot of the market 
says it can't start trading until trading standards are set, but that's 
bogus,"" Rice said. ""We've come up with a couple of standard contracts 
ourselves and believe the industry will adopt standards over time."" 
Meanwhile, the deal with Blockbuster to provide online delivery of movies was 
supposed to be the cornerstone of a business in which Enron would deliver a 
wide variety of content to homes and businesses. 
The companies had tests of the new service running in four cities, which 
appeared to be a success, but in early March the 20-year deal came to an 
abrupt end. 
Blockbuster was the first to announce the breakup, but Enron issued its own 
release a few hours later, saying Blockbuster was unable to secure the 
quality or quantity of movies from the studios needed to make the service a 
success. 
""Blockbuster had some relationships with the studios complete, but the 
studios ultimately weren't too excited about giving them control of the 
digital rights to films,"" Rice said. 
Enron Broadband now is working directly with the studios and other content 
producers to secure movie deals and expects to announce some of those 
relationships soon. The company also announced a new content deal to offer 
hundreds of video game titles online by June. 
For investors and analysts, however, the misstep with Blockbuster took the 
shine off Enron's apple. 
""They really sold the Blockbuster deal as an anchor tenant for broadband and 
as proof of their idea's success,"" said Jeff Dietert, vice president of 
research at Simmons & Company International. ""So when it fell through, the 
one major item we could point to as a sign of a successful execution was 
gone."" 
While Enron Broadband works toward earning its keep, Rice predicts broadband 
will become a bigger and bigger part of Enron's overall business. The group 
has started to trade online data storage - effectively offering companies an 
alternative to buying more storage hardware - and is even beginning to trade 
broadcast advertising time. 
""I think eventually it will be on par with natural gas retail and wholesale,"" 
Rice said. ""A lot of the guys in that division will say `no way,' but there's 
no doubt to anyone it will be big.""

A
SIGN OF THE TIMES / Glowing logo once hovered over the city that oil built
ALLAN TURNE
Staff

Houston Chronicle

(Copyright 2001)

For years, it hung over downtown Houston like some wacky corporate moon. 
Giant blue letters - Gulf - in an orange neon disc announced to land and air 
travelers that they were approaching the nation's oil capital. 
It was called ""The Lollipop."" At 58 feet tall, it was the world's largest 
rotating sign. And while the Gulf Oil Co. reveled in the giant corporate logo 
atop its neo-Gothic office tower, critics called it an 83-ton monument to 
tastelessness.
Today, as Houston reassesses its downtown architectural heritage and recasts 
itself as a city it hasn't been in 50 years, the hotly debated landmark of 
the 1960s and early '70s is largely forgotten. 
Still, with nostalgia an undercurrent in the central city's reawakening - 
Enron Field, loft apartments, refurbished office buildings and even a popular 
new diner all feature a ""retro"" feel - there are those who fondly recall when 
the downtown skyline was bathed in an orange glow. 
""When I first came to Houston for the first time,"" recalled Gordon Campbell, 
a former Gulf budget analyst, ""I flew from Tulsa on the company plane. That 
sign was one of the first things I saw. It really gave me a thrill."" 
""I was very passionate about it. . . . It was an icon,"" added one-time Gulf 
chemicals division executive Charles Rhoads, who first visited the city as a 
young Gulf employee in the mid-1960s. ""It was the definition of the skyline 
back then."" 
Undoubtedly the sign that had been atop what is now the Chase Bank building 
was an eye-catcher. 
With 4,700 square feet of display area illuminated by 7,350 feet of neon 
tubing, the sign rotated at a steady 1 1/2 revolutions a minute. 
""Airline pilots used it as a beacon,"" boasted Sherman H. Hink, chairman and 
chief executive officer of Neon Electric Corp., the company that built the 
sign. ""It was advertising. As far as I'm concerned, bigger is better. The 
object of any sign is to sell."" 
Built at a cost of $250,000, the sign took six months to erect. When it was 
completed in the summer of 1966, it commanded immediate attention. 
Signs of the Times magazine, a trade journal, featured the sign on the cover 
of its September issue. Gulf Oil Co. issued postcards of it, noting on the 
back that the ""landmark will guide travelers and residents to the heart of 
Houston."" 
""It was a fantastic sign,"" Hink said. ""People loved this sign."" 
Or at least some people loved the sign. 
""I don't want to be disrespectful,"" said Bill Roher, former president of 
Gulf's chemicals division, ""but I was somewhat aghast. I hadn't seen anything 
that garish in any of of the cities I had been in. It wasn't the only sign. 
Tenneco, all the other oil companies had signs emblazoned on their buildings. 
But nothing like Gulf. We outdid them. 
""It was very emblematic of the times. There were very aggressive advertising 
people who felt that was one way to sell gasoline."" 
Former Houston Chronicle fine-arts editor Ann Holmes said the sign made the 
the old bank building look like an oversized gas pump, to the amusement of 
some. 
""It became a joke and not a very funny one,"" she said. 
Artie Lee Hinds, then and now a member of the Houston Municipal Art 
Commission, recalled that members of the advisory body abhorred the sign. 
""They didn't like it,"" she said. ""It wasn't that the sign wasn't 
good-looking. The art commission didn't want any signs on any buildings, and 
this one was revolving around."" 
Members of the commission quietly urged Gulf management to remove the sign as 
a public service. 
Today, such a sign, which finally came down in 1975, never would pass muster 
with a city ordinance that regulates sign height and size. 
Critics never warmed to the Gulf sign as they did - begrudgingly, perhaps - 
to the giant red neon Pegasus that revolved above the old Magnolia Oil Co. 
headquarters in Dallas. 
""The Pegasus is interesting,"" said Rice University architectural historian 
Stephen Fox. ""I don't think the Gulf sign was offensive in any way. But it 
never claimed people's affection as a civic symbol the way the Magnolia 
emblem did in Dallas. It basically was a transposition and magnification of a 
Gulf filling-station sign. There was nothing special, nothing especially 
Houston about it."" 
While the details of why the gargantuan sign was erected in the first place 
probably are lost to history - many of those involved in the project are dead 
- Fox suggested Gulf simply may have been trying to regain its lost 
prominence on the Houston skyline. 
When the sign was erected, Gulf, which traced its history to the 1901 
discovery of oil at Spindletop, occupied a striking old bank building at Main 
and Rusk streets. 
Built in 1929 and standing 450 feet in height, it long had been the tallest 
building west of the Mississippi River. In 1963, though, Gulf's tower was 
eclipsed by the 600-foot-tall headquarters of the Humble Oil and Refining Co. 
(now Exxon Mobil) at 800 Bell Ave. 
The orange disc brought the Gulf Building's height to more than 500 feet - 
still short of Humble's height but topping its rival in garishness and 
illumination. 
By the time Z.D. Bonner became president of Gulf Oil - United States in the 
early 1970s, criticism of the sign had reached a crescendo. 
""It certainly was not an asset,"" Bonner said. ""We had very few people - aside 
from those in the Gulf marketing department - who really liked it. And there 
were mechanical problems with it. It had suffered wind damage."" 
When the massive porcelain panels were dismantled - a process Hink said took 
about a month - workers were surprised to find they were pockmarked with 
bullet holes. 
""We got a letter of commendation from some civic association for taking it 
down,"" Bonner recalled. 
The sign was replaced with a helicopter pad, which remains atop the building. 
Gulf Oil Co. lost its corporate identity in a mid-1980s merger with the San 
Francisco-based Chevron Cos. 
About the time the Houston sign was dismantled, Dallas' neon flying horse - 
erected in 1934 for an oil convention - was donated to the city. It was 
welded in place to keep it from toppling. In 1997, its neon lights went dark, 
victims of the elements and neglect. 
Admirers of the sign raised $600,000 from individual and corporate donors - 
including Magnolia's descendant, Exxon Mobil - to replace the 15-ton sign 
with a replica. The new sign was illuminated at the stroke of midnight on New 
Year's Day 2000. 
No such resurrection was in the cards for the Gulf sign. 
Its porcelain panels were taken to Hink's workshop on the city's northwest 
side. Hink kept the small ""R"" from the sign's trademark emblem for himself 
and donated the rest to an employee who wanted to use the panels to build a 
barn. 
The barn was built, but the worker since has died, and Hink no longer 
remembers where the farm was located.

preserved; 2. Known as ""The Lollipop,"" Gulf Oil Co.'s rotating orange, white

THE NEW POWER / Returns on investments too slow in developing nations
JENALIA MORENO, MICHAEL DAVIS, JANAKI BAHADUR KREMMER

JUST A FEW years ago, Enron Corp. focused its international operations in 
developing markets such as Maputo, Mozambique, and Bombay, India. 
Today, top executives for the Houston-based giant are more likely to fill 
their passports with stamps from London, Tokyo or Sydney.
As in many other public energy companies, a keen interest in building 
pipelines and power plants in Third World nations while earning a slow rate 
of return has been replaced with a drive to deliver more money, faster to 
shareholders, analysts said. 
That's led to a for-sale sign on many of its international operations. 
Enron and analysts believe the company's international fortune lies in 
creating markets for gas, electricity and almost anything else that they can 
profitably trade. Outsiders say building big power plants has been a 
profitable line of business for them, but it ties up too much money. 
""We're perfectly happy to make our way along by buying and selling from other 
people who have power plants,"" said John Sherriff, president and chief 
operating officer of Enron Europe. 
More than a year ago, Japan opened up 30 percent of its electricity market to 
competition. The island nation charges some of the highest power rates in the 
world, and Enron is eager to get into that market. 
Enron Chairman Ken Lay said he is hopeful, despite a relatively slow start, 
because he senses a change in attitude on the part of Japanese business 
leaders. 
Enron already has set up a joint venture to market the power of some 
privately owned power plants, and Enron's broadband network will be tied into 
Tokyo by the end of the year. Hong Kong, Singapore and India will follow. 
""There is a much greater sense of urgency to make changes and get their 
economy competitive with the U.S. economy and other economies around the 
world,"" Lay said. 
Europe also is opening up its energy market. 
Enron's annual report last year predicted: ""In just a few years, the 
competitive European wholesale power market will rival the size of the power 
sector in the United States. Enron expects to assume the leading position in 
Europe as it has done in North America."" 
In 1989, Enron chose Europe for its first international foray. 
""We didn't really tiptoe into the market,"" said Sherriff. ""We really came 
into it in a big way."" 
Today, Enron employs 4,000 people in Europe. 
Worldwide it operates in more than 30 nations. 
""Our business model works best when we're pretty sure we're going to get 
paid, where there's a rule of law, where there's a lack of bribery,"" said 
Sherriff, explaining why the company does not operate in most Eastern 
European countries. 
Such ventures in developing countries could reap significantly higher returns 
than power plants in India, where the company has faced everything from 
accusations of human rights violations to bureaucratic red tape. 
But analysts and critics alike question whether the move to the safer haven 
of developed nations is because of a series of troubles with big energy 
projects in developing markets. While outsiders have long followed Enron's 
battles over its power electric plant in the Indian city of Dabhol, its 
problems with the Asian nation go beyond that. 
Plans for trading in bandwidth by building a broadband telecom network with 
971,000 miles of fiber-optic cable connecting four Indian cities also have 
been put on hold. 
""Due to the lengthy delay and continued disagreement on critical commercial 
and legal issues, Enron has determined that its involvement (in the 
fiber-optic venture) is no longer financially viable,"" said John Ambler, an 
Enron spokesman. 
""Since we tend to focus on the more open and developed markets, it is too 
early to determine whether the market will open in an acceptable time frame 
in India,"" he added. 
While analyst Subhash Agarwal, editor of India Focus, a political risk 
magazine, sees Enron concentrating elsewhere, he says opportunities still 
exist in India. 
""They are clearly shifting away from asset-owning to trading in the energy 
business, but a lot still needs to be done in India before they can freely do 
that here,"" Agarwal said. 
The problems they have faced in the electricity business help explain why 
they are wary about such commitments. 
Analysts said selling less-profitable assets is all part of Enron's strategy 
of frequently changing its businesses, which has been a cornerstone of its 
success. 
""You're never going to win on every single investment, but Enron is usually 
smart enough to know when to get out,"" said Rebecca Followill, an analyst in 
Houston for Howard, Weil.

THE NEW POWER / Working environment now driven more by new ideas than old 
doctrine
MICHAEL DAVIS
Staff

04/15/2001
Houston Chronicle

(Copyright 2001)

FOR CLAUDE TELLIS, working at Enron Corp. has meant being able to develop an 
idea, pitch it to his bosses and see it through to success. 
Within a year of joining the company, Tellis was one of a group of employees 
who put together Enron Investment Partners, a venture- capital fund that 
specializes in bankrolling minority- and women- owned businesses. It started 
with $40 million to invest, and that's expected to grow to some $300 million.
Tellis was given the chance even though his idea had nothing to do with Enron
's main businesses. He just had to prove that the concept was viable and then 
be willing to work to make it happen. 
Tellis explains it all by saying: ""Enron is a meritocracy."" 
An open attitude toward new ideas is often cited as one of the key components 
to the success of Enron as the company continually reinvents itself. 
The associates program, in which Tellis operates, is one of the best examples 
of this attitude. Recent MBAs are rotated through various Enron businesses 
for two years, allowing them to decide where they might best fit in at the 
huge company. 
The person largely responsible for the program as it is today is Jeffrey 
Skilling, recently named chief executive officer. 
Although Enron has had programs for incoming MBAs for most of its history, it 
was after the arrival of Skilling in 1990 that the associates program really 
took off. 
""We created a whole new culture,"" Skilling says. ""We knocked down a lot of 
walls, literally."" 
Skilling and others running Enron often single out employees such as Tellis 
as being the future of the company as it chases an ever- growing number of 
markets. Skilling has likened the recruiting to an arms race. 
""We realized early on that the name of the game was technology and brains,"" 
Skilling said. 
All of which sounds like a logical approach. But Tellis learned from hard 
experience that the culture in other companies is not always so accommodating 
to new hires. 
After getting his undergraduate degree from Duke University, he was eager to 
get into deal-making and went to work for one of the nation's biggest 
business consulting firms. 
""They told me to think outside the box, but the only box I was in was a Power 
Point box,"" Tellis said, referring to the popular software used for 
presentations. Rather than being put on deal teams, he was relegated to 
putting together slide presentations for higher- ups. 
He returned to college and earned his master's of business administration 
from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Soon after, he was 
hired by Enron and joined the associates program. 
The expansion of the associates program in the early 1990s was accompanied by 
a change in the layout of Enron's offices to reflect a more open corporate 
culture. Skilling wanted to express a sense of equal opportunity by 
advocating an environment where everyone operated in an open office space. 
Skilling also began to offer an axiom to new employees wanting to propose new 
ideas: The quality of an idea is usually proportionate to its distance from 
the 50th floor. 
The 50th floor is where Enron's top executives, including Skilling, have 
their offices. 
The concept of an open office in the energy industry was revolutionary in the 
early 1990s, said Bob Bruner, a professor at the University of Virginia who 
has done a case study on Enron's evolution. Companies that operate in 
regulated businesses tend to be very bureaucratic, and Enron was no exception 
in its early days, he said. 
""Enron had to become a new animal. This meant that it had to shed layers of 
organization,"" Bruner said. ""They shed lots of little things like offices 
that went with titles and created the open- office concept."" 
Not all of the cultural changes at Enron have been met with a warm reception 
from employees. A new evaluation system being used at the company is 
considered by some to be divisive rather than supportive. 
This so-called ""horizontal"" evaluation process has angered some employees who 
think it pits employees against each other. Under the system, employees are 
required to spend about two weeks out of the year ranking their fellow 
employees in five categories. 
The process has been referred to as ""rank and yank,"" and can be brutal, 
employees say - a corporate version of the television show Survivor in which 
workers can gang up on others they may not like for whatever reason. 
The new evaluation program is a good example of how Enron can be a tough 
place to cut it for those not determined to work harder than the rest. It 
also is regarded as an employer that can often overwhelm its workers' 
personal lives. Ten- to 12-hour days are not that unusual at the company, 
former Enron employees say. 
Tellis normally puts in about a 10-hour day and frequently works weekends, 
but when a deal is about to close, Enron's downtown office becomes his second 
home. 
No matter how warm and fuzzy the Enron culture is presented to the public, 
the company clearly does not suffer fools gladly. 
When asked what sort of day he typically puts in at Enron, Tellis cast a 
nervous eye to the public relations person sitting next to him and asked, ""Do 
I have to answer that?""

ENRON CORP. is in a hurry. That is evident to anyone watching workers 
scurrying about to erect additional steel beams to the skeleton of the Enron 
Center South tower emerging on the downtown skyline. 
It will become even more evident this summer when Enron will begin moving 
1,000 employees into the building before construction is complete. While work 
continues above and below, Enron employees will be doing their jobs on the 
tower's third, fourth and fifth floors.
The 40-story tower going up across the street from the 50-story Enron Center 
North won't be complete until the summer of 2002. 
Finishing the elaborate 40-story office tower can't happen soon enough for 
William R. Donovan, the Enron vice president managing the construction 
project. 
Employees of the company, whose explosive growth made it the biggest in town 
in terms of revenues, are tightly packed into the current Enron building and 
have spilled over into other towers on the southwestern edge of downtown. 
""We need the space. We have just about soaked up about every square foot of 
short-term leased space within walking distance,"" Donovan said. 
When the tower is finished, the imprint of the corporate culture will be 
stamped into the new Enron Center South. 
At the heart of the 1.2 million-square-foot building will be massive trading 
floors that house the company's key business. These open spaces on the lower 
levels will be home to traders buying and selling everything from electricity 
to wood pulp, from natural gas to broadband communications capacity. 
The importance of those traders, and the company's open culture, also will 
shape the design of the offices of Enron Chairman Ken Lay and Chief Executive 
Officer Jeff Skilling. Their offices will be on the seventh floor overlooking 
the trading floors. Two curved grand stairways will connect their offices to 
where the action is. 
""I think it says a lot about how Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling view the 
corporation,"" meaning they don't want to be sequestered away, said architect 
Gregg Jones of Cesar Pelli & Associates, the New Haven, Conn., firm that 
designed the new tower. 
The company, which profits from the world's insatiable appetite for energy, 
is going to occupy a new headquarters that will reflect Enron's emphasis on 
energy efficiency, Jones said. 
The south, west and east sides of the building will be adorned with metal 
sunshades and fins that deflect the sun and lower energy costs. 
""You will be shading an entire skyscraper,"" Jones said. 
The building will be wrapped in bluish-gray glass that matches the Enron 
tower across the street. 
From aircraft flying above, the main tower of Enron Center South will appear 
to have the same shape as the Enron Center North building - sort of an oval 
shape with flattened sides. 
The ovalish shape will be a decorative theme that is repeated in Enron Center 
South in many ways. Tiny ovals will be etched into the glass of the windows 
in the building; small oval holes will be punched into the sunshades and 
replicated in the elevator doorjambs. 
A curved sky bridge will connect the two buildings and the 15- level parking 
garage that is under construction at the corner of Bell and Smith. From 
above, the sky bridge will look like a ring around Saturn. The designers were 
hoping the circular tube would create something more than than ""just another 
gerbil tube"" between towers, Jones said. 
With the new building, Enron is creating an urban corporate campus. It will 
have a wide array of services for its employees, from child care to medical 
care to on-site food services. The ground floor will have restaurants, retail 
space and a 240-seat auditorium. 
The company that is rushing to get into the new building already has 
long-term plans for another building. Donovan said Enron owns a full block 
downtown bounded by Bell, Leeland, Louisiana and Milam where the third tower 
could be built, if needed. 
Enron hired the Cesar Pelli firm to help make its statement on the Houston 
skyline. The firm, led by Pelli, the former dean of the architecture school 
at Yale University, designed the one of the tallest office projects in the 
world, the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
In Houston he designed a number of prominent buildings, including the St. 
Luke's Medical Towers in the Texas Medical Center, whose twin spires look 
like hypodermic needles to many Houstonians. 
He also designed the Four Oaks Place office towers and Four Leaf condominium 
towers near the Galleria. 
In a few months, when the exterior skin of Enron Center South is applied, it 
will give the tower a notable place in the downtown skyline. 
""It's going to be very elaborate. It's not going be that minimalistic 1980s 
architecture,"" Donovan said. ""It's going to be a much, much more ornate 
facade than I think downtown has seen in 50 years.""

Although construction will continue on some floors until summer 2002, the 
company plans to move 1,000 employees into the building this year

(Copyright 2001)

1985 - Houston Natural Gas merges with Omaha, Neb., -based InterNorth to 
create the company that would eventually be named Enron Corp. The deal 
integrated several pipeline systems to create the first nationwide natural 
gas pipeline system. 
1986 - Ken Lay, who had been chief executive officer of Houston Natural Gas, 
is named chairman and chief executive officer. The company chooses the name 
Enron after rejecting Interon.
1987 - Enron discovers that oil traders in New York have overextended the 
company's accounts by almost $1 billion. The company ultimately worked this 
loss down to $142 million. This leads to Enron developing a myriad of 
services to help reduce the risk of price swings for everything from gas to 
advertising space. 
1988 - Enron opens its first overseas offices in England to take advantage of 
the country's privatization of its power industry. 
The company's major strategy shift - to pursue unregulated markets in 
addition to its regulated pipeline business - is revealed to executives in a 
gathering that became known as the ""Come to Jesus"" meeting. 
1989 - Jeffrey Skilling joins the company and Enron launches its Gas Bank, a 
program under which buyers of natural gas can lock in long-term supplies at 
fixed prices. The company also begins to offer financing for oil and gas 
producers. 
1992 - Enron acquires Transportadora de Gas del Sur. It was Enron's first 
pipeline presence in South America and the start of a push to expand on the 
continent. 
1993 - Enron's Teesside power plant in England begins operation, one of the 
first big successes for the company's international strategy. 
1994 - Enron makes its first electricity trade, beginning what will turn out 
to be one of the company biggest profit centers in the next few years. 
1995 - Enron Europe establishes a trading center in London, marking the 
company's entry into European wholesale markets. Europe is now considered one 
of the company's prime growth markets. 
1996 - Construction begins on the first phase of the Dabhol power plant in 
India. The $2 billion project would be plagued with political problems 
throughout its construction and those problems continue today. 
1997 - To expand its electricity business, Enron buys Portland General 
Electric Corp., the utility serving the Portland, Ore., area. 
Enron Energy Services is formed to provide energy management services to 
commercial and industrial customers. 
1998 - Enron acquires Wessex Water in the United Kingdom, which forms the 
basis for its water subsidiary Azurix. 
1999 - Enron forms its broadband services unit. The first phase of the Dabhol 
project begins operations. One-third of Azurix is sold to the public in an 
initial public offering. After an early rise, shares fall sharply as the year 
goes on and the problems facing the company become apparent. 
Enron Online, the company's commodity trading Internet site, is formed. It 
quickly becomes the largest e-business site in the world. Enron Energy 
Services turns its first profit in the fourth quarter. 
2000 - Rebecca Mark resigns from her position as Azurix chairwoman and the 
company announces a plan to take the troubled water subsidiary private. 
Annual revenues reach $100 billion, more than doubling from the year before, 
reflecting the growing importance of trading. 
Enron Field is opened in downtown Houston. In addition to buying the naming 
rights, Enron Chairman Ken Lay helped raise financial support for the 
construction project. 
2001 - Skilling is named chief executive officer. Lay remains chairman of the 
board.

GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS
Oil-Patch Epicenter, Embracing the Web
By JOEL KOTKIN

04/15/2001
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

HOUSTON -- AS the daughter of an oil-field supplier in Lake Charles, La., two 
and a half hours from this booming energy capital, Claire S. Farley says she 
always knew she would end up in the business herself. Often the only woman in 
her geology classes in college, Ms. Farley did eventually become one of the 
few top executives in the energy industry who are women. She held several 
high-level positions at Texaco, including president of North American oil and 
gas production. 
Today, Ms. Farley, 42, finds herself and the company where she is chief 
executive, Trade-Ranger, in another pioneering role. Trade-Ranger, which 
provides Internet-based business-to-business services to energy companies and 
suppliers, is part of a growing information sector that is rapidly 
transforming both the energy industry and this historically blue-collar city.
Energy companies have tended to be insular, Ms. Farley said, conducting most 
of their basic research and development internally. But to take advantage of 
new information technologies, she said, they increasingly look to new 
businesses like hers. Trade-Ranger, whose clients include 15 major energy 
companies, helps manage transactions between those companies and key 
suppliers over an Internet-based global network. 
It is a potentially huge business, she said, adding that global energy 
companies spend more than $500 billion a year procuring most anything from 
pipes to computer services. ''Fundamentally, the people in this business are 
looking for information and economies of scale,'' she said, pointing to a 
need to buy large quantities of goods and services at the best available 
prices. ''Ten years ago, they would have done this themselves, but now they 
are looking for people who can give them solutions.'' 
In a broader sense, Houston-based companies like Trade-Ranger and the 
PetroCosm Corporation, a rival whose founders include Chevron, are part of a 
rising tide of technology businesses connected to the energy industry. As 
technology companies, especially Internet businesses, are collapsing in 
places like San Francisco and New York, energy-related technology concerns 
have not been as troubled by the collapse of the Nasdaq or weakening investor 
confidence. 
Trade-Ranger, founded last summer, has more than $90 million in venture 
capital from energy companies like Royal Dutch/Shell and BP Amoco. That money 
lets the company invest heavily in new technology. 
But it is not just Internet companies that are thriving here. Other 
technology companies -- in fields as different as geology and market analysis 
-- are also growing rapidly. 
That is a major departure from previous energy expansions, like the boom of 
the 1970's, when growth came largely from manufacturing oil-field equipment 
or dispatching riggers around the world. Barton Smith, an economics professor 
at the University of Houston, said that much of what Houston needs today, and 
is selling to the world, is technological and managerial expertise. 
RECENT employment numbers reflect the trend. Over the last three years, the 
fastest rate of job growth in Houston has been concentrated in business 
services, as well as engineering, accounting, research and management 
services. In contrast, the traditional energy sector, which includes oil 
companies and businesses directly engaged in mining, gained only 10,000 jobs 
last year, well below historical highs. 
''Houston's energy economy is increasingly high tech,'' Mr. Smith said. 
''It's white collar, not blue collar.'' 
Other evidence of a white-collar expansion can be seen in the office market. 
New office towers, including headquarters for energy businesses like Enron 
and Reliant Resources, have been rising downtown. Vacancy rates in the 
central core, as high as 30 percent in the late 1980's, have dropped into the 
single digits. Once a ghost town after hours, downtown is starting to become 
a more popular destination, and increasingly a residential hub, for young 
professionals. 
The surge in technology-related employment is also spreading across the vast 
greater Houston area, which is larger than all of New Jersey. Much of the 
most recent growth has been beyond the city limits, a periphery that is home 
to nearly 2.7 million of the region's estimated 4.6 million residents. 
''The growth is becoming inevitable,'' said David Wolff, president of the 
Wolff Companies, a developer in the energy corridor along the city's western 
suburbs. ''The billings are increasing at all the energy companies -- that's 
billions in new spending coming on line.'' 
THE new wealth has created a large middle class of accountants, lawyers and 
other professionals, many of them directly or indirectly serving the energy 
industry. More fashionable boutiques and high-end restaurants are opening 
throughout the area, joining places like the Galleria -- west of downtown -- 
the shopping and office center where Trade-Ranger is based. ''Houston,'' Ms. 
Farley said, ''is becoming chic.'' 
The shift away from a blue-collar base extends even into the industry's 
historic core -- the wildcatters. Once identified with roughnecks and 
seat-of-the-pants entrepreneurs, the exploration industry now relies more on 
sophisticated sensing and computer-modeling technology than on elbow grease. 
Companies like Davis Petroleum, which explores largely in the Gulf of Mexico, 
depend increasingly on such technologies to uncover oil and natural-gas 
supplies. The family-owned business, which has grown to 50 employees from 20 
in the last five years, now includes 10 highly paid scientists. ''There's a 
tremendous amount of data generated in this business and a huge paper 
trail,'' said Gregg James Davis, the company's president. ''To be efficient, 
you have to get down to the digits so you can make better guesses as to where 
to drill.'' 
Deregulation of energy prices has also increased demand for sophisticated 
trading information, said Jay P. Lukens, 46, president of the Lukens Energy 
Group, which provides information and trend analysis on energy prices, as 
well as advice for mergers and acquisitions for major utilities and 
generators. 
Founded in 1999, Lukens has grown to 20 employees, from 6, virtually all of 
them with graduate degrees. The company uses the latest computer-modeling 
technology for utilities and energy concerns, including the Williams 
Companies, Alberta Energy and BP Amoco. Lukens's billings are rising to an 
estimated $6 million this year from $2 million two years ago. 
Mr. Lukens says, however, that his company remains an energy business at 
heart. ''We have the software,'' he said, ''but what we are selling in 
reality is knowledge of the market itself.'' 
Such expertise, Ms. Farley said, will give Houston a competitive edge. Even 
if oil prices drop, major energy companies merge and most new drilling 
continues to take place thousands of miles from the Texas coast, she predicts 
that the city's new technology-oriented energy sector will continue to 
expand. 
''Houston now sells its expertise,'' said Ms. Farley, whose major investors 
are from outside of Texas. ''Why not London or Los Angeles? Why, it's the oil 
business -- it has to be in Houston. Everyone you know who's important in 
this business passes through here. It's where the information is.''

Sierra Pacific Suspends Quarterly Payout Because of Energy Crisis in Western 
States
By Rhonda L. Rundle

04/15/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Staff Reporter Of The Wall Street Journal 
Sierra Pacific Resources, which owns two Nevada utilities, said it suspended 
its quarterly dividend, citing high power costs and other fallout from the 
energy crisis afflicting the Western part of the U.S.
The utility holding company said it still hopes to complete a $2 billion 
agreement to purchase Enron Corp.'s Portland General Electric unit. The 
transaction, which will also include the assumption of $1 billion in debt, 
has been delayed partly because of a new California law that has blocked 
Sierra Pacific (SRP) from raising funds through planned sales of certain 
power-generating assets. 
Sierra Pacific has paid a quarterly dividend of 25 cents in recent quarters. 
Suspension of the payout will save ""less than $20 million -- but every dollar 
counts at times like this,"" said Mark Ruelle, senior vice president and chief 
financial officer. The dividend policy will be reviewed again at the next 
board meeting, set for May 21, the company said. 
Sierra Pacific, based in Las Vegas, said it is continuing several 
cost-control programs that were recently undertaken to reduce expenses. The 
cutbacks are mainly in the area of administrative expenses and include 
elimination this year of incentive pay for executive staff. 
Sierra Pacific, like utility owners in other Western states, has been hit by 
rising energy costs. Sierra Pacific has said it incurred an unanticipated 
expense of $889 million in 2000 to purchase fuel and electricity on the open 
market. That produced a full-year 2000 loss of $39.8 million, or 51 cents a 
share.

India: Report cautions Maharashtra on PPAs
Mahesh Vijapurkar

04/15/2001
The Hindu
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, APRIL 14. A caution that any effort to continue with the proposed 
power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Reliance and Mittals for major projects 
in Maharashtra ""will only result in a problem similar to that of the Dabhol 
Power Company (DPC) re- emerging in future"" has been sounded by the Madhav 
Godbole Committee. 
The committee - major findings of which have been publicised - expressed 
fears on ""allowing these independent power producers to proceed, as currently 
structured"". The two projects, one in Patalganga and another in Chandrapur, 
also have substantial import content.
These projects, the committee said, have to be ""re- examined in accordance 
with a Least Cost Plan and in any case, till such time the demand level in 
the State permits full absorption of power"" from these independent power 
producers. It may be recalled that all arithmetic, including demand 
projections by the MSEB, have gone awry in the Enron-sponsored DPC. 
Neither of the two projects is contractually structured to meet the needs of 
intermediate and peaking load in the MSEB or Maharashtra itself. The MSEB 
needs to justify projections in more detail ""before proceeding with these 
projects"", the committee said. The MSEB's power procurement policy till the 
Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission stepped in was not according to 
a least-cost plan. In fact, the MERC's least-cost option unsettled the 
purchase option from the DPC, forcing it to limit the maximum offtake to 
around 50 per cent of the contractual obligation.

Graft vs graft: Political scene in state hits nadir
Ambarish Mishra

04/15/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: The opposition Shiv Sena-BJP combine, according to the Vidhan Bhavan 
grapevine, is ready with a videotape showcasing the escapades of a prominent 
minister in the ruling Democratic Front (DF) government. 
``With videotapes here, there and everywhere, we will have to build a preview 
theatre,'' remarked a senior official of the state legislature.
`Make hay with an allegation a day' seems to be the mantra in the corridors 
of power. With DF ministers and the opposition Shiv Sena-BJP bigwigs choking 
on allegations and running away at the mouth, Maharashtra's political sensex 
seems to have hit an all-time low. 
Charges and counter-charges, traded with the glee of a Dahyabhai from Dalal 
Street, have been taking up a considerable portion of the budget session's 
proceedings at a time when the state's financial health is precarious, to say 
the least, with more than 20,000 villages reeling under acute water scarcity. 
Also, the state administration is weighed down by a host of problems, 
including the prolonged strike of resident doctors, a worsening law and order 
situation and l'affaire Enron, not to speak of the bickerings within the 
eight-party ruling combine. 
``It is unfortunate that the assembly has been converted into an akhada. The 
trading of charges has, apart from vitiating the political atmosphere, 
lowered the prestige of the state legislature,'' said a former speaker of the 
legislative assembly. 
During the first two weeks of the budget session, which began on March 13, 
the Sena-BJP combine went bang bang bang targeting minister of state for 
public health Eknath Gaikwad, deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal and chief 
minister Vilasrao Deshmukh. The Sena-BJP leaders flaunted affidavits filed by 
several youths in support of their claim that Mr Gaikwad's personal assistant 
had demanded money, right in the presence of the minister, as a quid pro quo 
for offering government jobs. 
Closing in on the chief minister, prominent BJP leader Nitin Gadkari, while 
speaking in the legislative council, accused him of having indulged in 
``corruption'' while finalising the purchase of a spinning mill in Latur, the 
CM's hometown. 
The Vilasrao Deshmukh ministry retaliated against Mr Gadkari, who belongs to 
Nagpur, with a threat to supercede the Nagpur municipal corporation on 
charges of, what else, bhrashtachaar (graft). 
Moreover, the ruling DF alliance accused leader of the opposition Narayan 
Rane of having drained the state exchequer of a staggering Rs 124 crore by 
gifting away a government plot to Esselworld in 1996 when Mr Rane held the 
revenue portfolio in the Manohar Joshi cabinet. 
As if this was not enough, the treasury benches okayed the suspension of BJP 
MLAs. Although the suspension orders against five of the nine legislators 
have since been revoked, the coup de grace has embittered the Sena-BJP 
combine. ``The state government is plainly vindictive,'' declared BJP leader 
Gopinath Munde. ``The opposition should learn to behave,'' retorted a DF 
minister. 
More fireworks took place in the assembly last week, belying hopes that the 
house would take up issues of public importance for discussion and decision. 
A judgment by the division bench of the Bombay high court last Monday held Mr 
Rane guilty of condoning irregularities in a land de-reservation case. The 
verdict brought cheer in the DF camp. 
However, an unrepentant Mr Rane hit back with an allegation that Mr Bhujbal, 
who holds the home portfolio, and his close relatives had demanded a tidy sum 
from a senior IPS official in connection with his transfer. 
The plot thickened with the allegation by senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde 
that Mr Bhujbal had set free two COFEPOSA detenues for a hefty Rs 2 crore. 
And on to a new allegation on Monday, when the state legislature resumes 
business after a brief recess. ``Not a single charge is backed with foolproof 
evidence. Tehelka.com seems to have fired the imagination of Maharashtra's 
politicians,'' said the Vidhan Bhavan official, referring to the audiotapes 
which Mr Rane flaunted in the house while making out a case against Mr 
Bhujbal.

Editorial/Opinion
In an energy crisis, lean toward the green
Molly Ivins
Fort Worth Star-Telegram

04/15/2001
The News & Observer Raleigh, NC
Final
A27
(Copyright 2001)

BOULDER, Colo. -- At the annual World Affairs Conference at the University of 
Colorado, the assorted experts from around the globe may sometimes be wrong, 
but they are rarely in doubt. 
This lends a happy, ""But the emperor isn't wearing any clothes,"" simplicity 
to much of the discussion. Shibboleths are ignored, obligatory bows to those 
who are only partially informed are skipped entirely, and folks get right 
down to the lick-log.
Thus, Harvey Wasserman, a longtime leader of the anti-nuclear movement, 
cutting to the chase: ""Anyone who advocates nuclear power as a solution to 
our energy problems should be shut up in a padded cell."" 
Wasserman can, of course, discuss the details of nuclear plant design, risk, 
insurance, regulation, waste disposal, etc., ad nauseam. It's just that he'd 
rather not waste his time on the obvious. 
One session I attended here not expecting to learn much new (but it's always 
nice to have your prejudices confirmed) was titled ""Our Fake Energy Crisis: 
What Really Happened in California."" 
The aforementioned Wasserman waded in with a will, describing the dastardly 
tale of ruthless utility companies determined to unload the ""stranded costs"" 
of their monumental folly in building nuclear plants - $20 billion worth in 
California's case - on the ratepayers. Given that utility lobbyists literally 
wrote the California deregulation bill, it's quite a reach to blame it on 
anyone else. 
This is a familiar tale to those who have read beyond the basic coverage of 
the California situation. Wasserman tells the story well, with a fine 
contempt for the greed and stupidity behind it all and for the politicians 
now seeking cover. But he presents a media mystery that has me stumped - one 
of those cases of the media overlooking the obvious so completely that one is 
bereft of a handy explanation. 
Some parts of California are not suffering from power problems of any kind. 
In Los Angeles and Sacramento, the lights are still on and the rates have not 
doubled or tripled. As it happens, the people of Los Angeles and Sacramento 
own their own power plants. This glaringly obvious fact has for some reason 
escaped media attention, except in California. 
The history of how utility ownership and regulation came about is crucial to 
this story. Wasserman quoted a 19th century mayor of Cleveland, Tom Johnson, 
who said, ""If we don't control the electric utilities, they will control us."" 
As is often the case with business and government regulation, it was the 
utilities themselves that asked for regulation, knowing full well that they 
could easily dominate state public utility commissions. ""Regulation"" evolved 
so that utilities were permitted to make 15 percent on invested capital - a 
tidy sum. 
This lasted until the early 1990s, when wholesale prices fell, tempting the 
utilities into deregulation. They dumped the stranded nuke costs on the 
ratepayers and made a promise in exchange - no rate increases - which they 
promptly broke when wholesale prices went up. Ask the people of San Diego. 
The performance of the suppliers in this case - Enron, Reliant, etc. - is 
already the subject of public inquiry. But the California utility companies 
were meanwhile shipping the recovered nuke costs to their parent companies. 
(""We're still checking the DNA on those parents,"" said Wasserman.) And then, 
in a truly sublime move, the major California utility gave its executives 
huge bonuses just before it went into bankruptcy. 
Wasserman's suggested solution is that Californians should simply get 
themselves out of the grid by setting up municipally owned power companies. 
In rural areas, this can be done by counties or electric co-ops. He believes 
that what held the old system together for so long was not government 
regulation, which was always blatantly subject to manipulation by the 
utilities (as anyone who has ever covered a PUC can tell you), but rather the 
tension between the for- profits and the municipals. 
In the current issue of Business Week, the cover story is on Exxon Mobil's 
plan to take advantage of the ""energy crisis."" This would normally be funny, 
given that Exxon is in the oil business and (as most people outside the Oval 
Office are aware), the oil business has nothing to do with electricity. 
However, Exxon's acquisition of Mobil, which is rich in natural gas, 
unleashes a corporate behemoth of unprecedented size. Exxon also has a 
corporate culture that would give nightmares to ""Chainsaw Al"" Dunlap of 
business fame. 
Here are some interesting facts from the Rocky Mountain Institute: The 
cheapest source of new electricity is efficiency; the next cheapest is 
burning soft coal, which is a gross polluter; and the next cheapest after 
that is wind power - 2.5 cents per kilowatt- hour.

",,
307,"All--here's some thoughts on the RGA related events.  We currently have Ken 
scheduled to participate in an energy roundtable discussion on the afternoon 
of the 2nd with at least four governors attending that session--Kempthorne, 
Hull, Geringer and Ridge.  (Engler and Rowland are also attending the overall 
event, but they will be in a healthcare breakout session).  Kaufman and I 
thought that it would be particularly helpful for Arizona Gov Hull and Idaho 
Gov Kempthorne to hear Ken's remarks and have a chance to talk with him.  

I have also been working with Rosalee to schedule an early evening 
(6:00-7:00pm) meeting that night  with Exelon co CEO John Rowe. John Rowe 
will be in California for some investor meetings and well as attending some 
sections of the RGA events.  I have told my counterpart at Rowe's office that 
we would confirm Ken's availability on Monday morning.

If you do decide that Ken should attend the Davis meeting in Sacremento that 
day instead, we will just reconfigure a bit.  Paul and I will cover the RGA 
events and I will cancel the John Rowe get together. I would also want to 
talk about having Mr. Lay reach out to Hull and Kempthorne via phone sometime 
in the near future.  Same with Rowe.

07/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) 
SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine 
Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the 
bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million 
for power already sold.
Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the 
announcement. 
As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that 
the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under 
the contracts, will be elevated to ""administrative priority status,"" a claim 
which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. 
Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed 
reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, 
Calpine said. 
The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy 
crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state 
with a series of rolling blackouts. 
Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual 
capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next 
five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's 
power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent 
more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated 
from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. 
""Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to 
ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these 
affordable and reliable energy resources,"" Calpine senior vice president 
James Macias said in a statement.",Calpine James Macias,more than $250 million more than $5 43 $267 million about 5.37 cents,"Calpine Reuters English News Service Reuters Limited 2001 Reuters Calpine

Monday, February 14, 2000 03:29 PM	

	
	
	?Mail this article to a friend 
	
	By Michael Rieke 
	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Washington, D.C. entrepreneur Ted Pierson is betting on 
a boom in bandwidth trading. 
	His company, LighTrade Inc., will spend $20 million-$25 million this year to 
install and operate hardware to trade bandwidth, or space on telecom lines, 
in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Miami, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle 
and Washington, D.C. 
	Bandwidth trading is growing, driven by increased demand by businesses for 
the Internet. In a report released last December, CIBC World Markets 
estimated that 20% of total bandwidth traffic, or $12 billion in revenues, 
could be traded in some manner within five years. 
	Last week, Oklahoma energy company Williams Communications Group Inc. (WCG, 
news, msgs) announced plans to open a bandwidth trading unit. 
	LighTrade will be the first company not affiliated with a larger energy or 
telecommunications concern to develop the trading sites, known as pooling 
points, Pierson told Dow Jones Newswires. 
	The points connect telecommunications carriers, allowing data to move from 
one network to another. They are installed in ""telecom hotels,"" buildings 
that house carrier facilities, and essentially consist of a Lucent 
Technologies Inc. (LU, news, msgs) bandwidth manager about the size of a 
tall, narrow refrigerator. 
	Enron Broadband Services, a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs), 
established the first two points last year in New York and Los Angeles. It 
plans to build another in London this year. 
	Last year, Enron Corp. proposed trading bandwidth under a standardized 
contract. It executed the first trade under the contract in December, buying 
space on a monthly basis on a New York-Los Angeles line from Global Crossing 
Ltd. of Bermuda. 
	Forrester Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based technology research firm, 
has charged that Enron's ownership of pooling points prevents neutrality in 
bandwidth trades. 
	Having an independent company like LighTrade operate points will help the 
bandwidth trading market get off the ground, said Stephen Kamman, a 
telecommunications industry analyst for CIBC World Markets. 
	It's a ""very positive"" development for the bandwidth trading market, said Tom 
Gros, vice president of international bandwidth trading for Enron. 
	""This is the first of what I think will be at least a few others who are 
interested in building pooling points that meet the Enron specifications for 
the open trading of bandwidth,"" Gros said. 
	The industry has been trading bandwidth without a standardized contract for 
years. Deals have typically taken weeks or months to negotiate. Companies 
must start from scratch with each deal, negotiating price, quantity, length 
of contract and quality of service. 
	In the past, deals have been long-term, sometimes as long as 20 years. But 
with the cost of bandwidth along some routes declining 15%-20% a year, such 
terms are less attractive. 
	Enron has also called on telecommunications companies to form a bandwidth 
trading organization, an independent body that will decide on standard terms 
and conditions for trading. Two groups in London and one in the United States 
are vying to form such a group. 
	LighTrade chose pooling point sites based on telecommunications traffic, 
Pierson said. Long-range plans call for the company to have sites in the 50 
U.S. cities that develop the most traffic. 
	But the company's pace building a network of points will depend on how 
quickly the telecommunications industry can decide on standards for trading 
bandwidth as a commodity. 
	LighTrade wants to install points in Boston, Houston, Las Vegas, Memphis and 
Phoenix in 2001, Pierson said. It is eyeing a move into international markets 
as early as next year, if the market will support it. Western Europe is a 
likely starting point, with Paris and Frankfurt possible sites. 
	Eventually, LighTrade could connect Miami to a South American city like Rio 
de Janeiro or Sao Paulo, and build Asian pooling points in sites like Tokyo 
and Osaka. 
	The company raised financing from private investors in two rounds last year 
and is now looking for investment from venture capital companies. 
	In addition to reaching an agreement with Lucent Technologies to use its 
bandwidth managers, LighTrade has another connection to the high-tech 
company. William Plunkett, a senior vice president at Lucent, is on 
LighTrade's board of directors. Pierson declined to say whether Lucent would 
invest in his company. 
	LighTrade isn't Pierson's first startup company. The telecommunications 
attorney founded Advanced Radio Telecom (ARTT, news, msgs), a NASDAQ-traded 
company that owns and operates broadband wireless metropolitan area networks. 
That company now has market capitalization of $800 million. 
	Pierson has commitments to tie pooling points into the networks of three 
major telecommunications carriers, he said. He wouldn't identify the 
companies. He said he doesn't know of any competitors building pooling 
points, but he expects others to enter the market. 
	He and his investors are taking a chance starting a company to develop 
pooling points because they don't know how quickly the market will develop, 
he said. 
	""But I wouldn't be in it if ... I did not think this would be a very 
significant economic return,"" Pierson said.

made by this Friday.  If not, a different action plan will occur.   This may 
change if other renewable QFs sue (for instance FP&L - who has retained

American Water Approves Offer by RWE, But Transaction Is Far From Completed
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

German utility RWE AG made an unsolicited offer of $46 a share for the largest publicly traded water-services company in the U.S., American Water Works Co. Under the terms of the deal, RWE will pay $4.6 billion in cash and assume $3 billion in debt. 
The performance of American Water Works of Voorhees, N.J., was one of the few bright spots in trading yesterday, its stock gaining $6.51 to $40.63, a rise of nearly 20%, at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Boards of both firms have approved the transaction, but it's far from completed. Because American Water Works has operations in 23 states and because water is highly regulated, the German company will have to convince utility regulators across the U.S. that it can be trusted with the stewardship of one of the most emotionally charged goods of all, drinking water. 
J. James Barr, chief executive of American Water, said his firm would do what it could to help RWE navigate the sometimes-byzantine American regulatory system. Mr. Barr said two trends are moving the water business internationally, privatization of public systems and consolidation. Both are putting RWE in a contest against larger French water companies that have been major consolidators, Vivendi Environment SA and Suez Lyonnaise. 
""Our board deliberated for a substantial time,"" Mr. Barr said, acknowledging it wondered about announcing the deal in present circumstances. ""But what better way to send a message of confidence in American markets than this?"" 
Upon completion of the transaction, RWE said it would combine its U.S. operations with Thames Water, the German firm's London-based water business that it purchased last year. 
Until recently, the water business has been regarded as a fairly unattractive investment. Returns are highly regulated and generally in the 10% to 11% range. At the same time, enormous capital investment is needed to meet rising clean-water standards, which puts unpopular pressure on rates. More than 80% of the nation's 55,000 water systems are municipally owned and there always is tension between public and private ownership of the essential good. 
American Water Works has grown into the nation's largest water utility through a patient but aggressive strategy of acquiring firms. Many analysts were surprised at the RWE transaction because they assumed that American Water Works would be one of the successful, surviving consolidators. 
""It had patriotism on its side,"" said utilities analyst Timothy Winter at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. ""It remains to be seen how RWE will calm fears"" about foreign ownership of American Water's 25 utilities that serve eight to 10 million people. 
Other companies have badly stumbled trying to consolidate and take advantage of water-system privatizations in foreign countries. Enron Corp. recently gave up on its strategy and sold its Azurix unit to American Water for an undisclosed sum. 
RWE has 12 major operating units and annual revenue of $57 billion. In addition to water-system holdings, it also sells electricity and natural gas and provides waste-water services.

INDIA: Enron India invokes guarantees for payments row.

NEW DELHI, Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Enron Corp's Dabhol Power Co (DPC) has invoked the federal government's counter-guarantee for bills not paid by a local utility, DPC said in a statement. 
DPC, 65-percent owned by Houston-based Enron Corp is engaged in a bitter payments dispute with its sole buyer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).
MSEB stopped buying power from Dabhol's 740-MW first phase in May and said it would not take electricity from the second 2,144-MW phase, which was 97-percent complete when further construction was halted due to the dispute. 
DPC spokesman Jimmy Mogal said the company invoked payment guarantees given by the Maharashtra state and New Delhi to protect the company, its sponsors, lenders and fuel suppliers. 
""I confirm that with MSEB's failure to meet their contractual obligations towards monthly bills of April, May and June 2001, DPC had drawn upon the government of Maharashtra (GOM) guarantee on August 29...,"" he said in a statement. 
""As GOM also failed to honour their contractual obligations, DPC was forced to draw upon (New Delhi's) guarantee towards these dues on September 7,"" he said.

Briefs: Houston and state 
Fuel-cell power plant rejected; shares drop 
DANBURY, Conn. -- FuelCell Energy's shares fell 5.3 percent Monday after a Connecticut agency's draft report rejecting the company's proposal to build a $124 million fuel-cell power plant in the state. 
Shares of FuelCell, based in Danbury, fell 66 cents to $11.83. They have fallen 72 percent in the past year. 
The Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control's draft report said some of the money for the project would have come from a state fund aimed at reducing electricity demand, not creating new plants. The FuelCell project would have supplied enough power to light about 26,000 homes. 
The project was to be funded by Houston-based Enron Corp. and the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority. 


USA: UPDATE 1-FERC judge offers plan for Northeast power RTO.
By Chris Baltimore

09/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - An administrative law judge at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Monday released a blueprint to establish a single electricity transmission system for 11 Northeastern states, possibly as early as the end of 2002, based on the existing PJM Interconnection LLC model. 
Regional transmission organizations (RTOs) are a priority for FERC, which is looking for ways to make the nation's patchwork transmission grid seamless in moving power between regions. An RTO is a combination of individual transmission operators that combine their assets under a common roof.
FERC wants to combine transmission operators into four RTOs for the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest and West. 
FERC Judge Peter Young wrote in a 27-page report that there were ""difficult substantive issues"" in the path of creating an RTO for the Northeast. 
In July, agency commissioners ordered the New York Independent System Operator, PJM Interconnection, PJM West and New England Independent System Operator to form a single RTO. Young has held secret talks with the parties since then to prepare a report and business plan to FERC commissioners, who are expected to issue a decision by Nov. 1. 
JUDGE NOTES DIFFICULT ISSUES 
Young said the new RTO would be modeled after the existing PJM Interconnection, which operates the grid for Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. 
The judge offered three options, reflecting the key issue of how quickly to complete planning and adoption of the new RTO. ""Many difficult substantive issues must be resolved among the stakeholders in the going forward process which the (FERC) business plan contemplates,"" Young wrote. 
The report was the result of talks involving dozens of utilities, government officials and groups, including Consolidated Edison Inc. , the Massachusetts attorney general, Credit Suisse First Boston International, the city of New York, and the Union of Concerned Scientists. Other energy firms involved in the closed-door talks included Dominion Resources Inc. , Duke Energy Corp. , Dynegy Inc. , Enron Corp. , First Energy Corp., Reliant Energy Inc. , and Williams Cos. Inc. . 
Britain's National Grid Group Plc in August was chosen to represent asset-holders of 60 percent of the Northeast transmission network, and was named as the operator of the new grid covering 11 states. 
The fastest of the three start-up schedules has the widest support, including the backing of PJM, PJM West and TransEnergie, a U.S.-Canadian transmission concern. The two-year transition plan, which could commence as early as Nov. 1, is based on the PJM operations model, which is already up and running. 
COMPLEX SOFTWARE NEEDED 
Another option offered by the judge would delay the start of the new RTO until the fourth quarter of 2004. 
Young warned that creating an RTO for the region would be a huge and complicated undertaking. 
The software and technology needed to set up an RTO to keep electricity smoothly moving throughout the Northeast will rank second only to that used by the banking industry, he said. 
""The Northeast RTO will constitute the largest energy market in the world,"" he wrote. ""The complexity of the technology it will take to implement and administer that market is staggering."" 
Young said he supported the PJM model, but warned that region has less divested generation and a lack of a large city like New York or Boston that exacerbate shortage situations. 
Some industry-watchers have questioned whether FERC should take a one-size-fits-all approach to RTOs with PJM. 
""PJM is great for PJM. But I disagree that it is the answer for other regions,"" said Lawrence Oliva, a partner in the national utility practice of accounting firm Andersen and Co.. 
New FERC Chairman Pat Wood, in a Reuters interview last week, acknowledged that FERC's outspoken support of PJM may have slowed down the mediation process. 
""I think that was probably a PR (public relations) mistake we made,"" Wood said. ""I think that all the Northeastern ISOs have something valuable."" 
Governance of the Northeast RTO board is the ""thorniest"" issue, Young wrote. One option proposed a 13-member board of directors for the RTO, made up of three members of each ISO board, and four members appointed by the individual stakeholders. 
FERC has praised the PJM system - which serves much of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland - as a model for nationwide RTO building. The agency has also turned down New York ISO and Northeast ISO requests to maintain their status as free-standing independent system operators.

I) Be sure to follow the rise in interest rates in UK, ECB, and US.  We
will be discussing the pros & cons of each region's rise.  Try to decide if
the ECB or the FT editorials (today pp. 12 & 13) are correct on the need
for the ECB rate increase.

II) You might also glance at articles on falling real estate prices in
Japan (p. 4), and the article on Daewoo's bankruptcy (p. 12).

III) Yesterday's FT had a long editorial on markets for the inputs into
global warming (Thurs. 11/4, p. 14).  What are the pros and cons of markets
for controlling externalities of this global sort?

IV) Hint: A typical set of exam questions might be...
Consider one of the following nations that have had special sections in the
FT this term: Ireland, Brazil or Ghana.
1. What is are 1 or 2 of the most serious threats to short-run growth in
GDP for this nation?
2. What short-run fiscal or monetary policies are appropriate?
3. What is are 1 or 2 of the most serious threats to short-run growth in
GDP for this nation?
4. What longer-term policies are appropriate?

These are just the sections of this week, and I do not promise to give a
large selection of nations (although I will give > 1 unless I choose Japan,
Russia, or the EC).

For this Saturday's section, I would like you guys to read (if you
haven't already) the article ""Restructuring gives Japan's workers
culture shock: Radical cuts by Nissan's French boss have wide
implications for Japan's jobs-for-life practices""

from the 11/3 Fin. Times.

Please think about how you might answer the following questions:

1. Should the government extend unemployment benefits to the laid off
workers from Nissan?

2. Why have Japanes companies paid younger workers less, and older
workers more, Does this policy make sense?

3. Should Nissan consider lowering the wages of some workers in order to
layoff fewer workers?

I have attached a word 6.0 version of the article.  Also please note
that section is in C135.

In addition I will try to discuss questions on Ghana, Ireland and Brazil
that Prof. Levine sent out.

Also I have attached an article on asset prices and inflation targetting
(from the FT) which discusses the dangers of ""debt deflation"". If we
have time I might discuss this as well.

See you on Saturday.

***************************************************************************

BRIENCE INFORMATION SESSION:
Date: Thursday, November 2.
Time: 12:30pm
Location: Faculty Club
Food will be served! There will be a raffle for a Palm VIIx. Please join us!

Brience was conceptualized in late 1999, and launched in March 2000 to
provide businesses with the flexibility, agility and power to meet the
challenge of mobile eBusiness. While working together at KPMG Consulting,
founders Rod McGeary, Keyur Patel, Arvin Babu and Joni Kahn had helped
countless clients including Cisco, Macromedia, Netscape, Sears, Bally's,
Bank of America, Fleet, Microsoft, and JP Morgan implement eBusiness
infrastructures to meet constantly changing market conditions and customer
demands.

The challenge they saw moving forward was to create a flexible, adaptive
approach that would meet the needs of ensuing generations of eBusiness:
generations faced with myriad devices, diverse content, the convergence of
back-end systems with customer facing operations, and an emphasis on
customization. Brience is the answer to that challenge.
Headquartered in San Francisco, Brience today has nearly 200 employees
worldwide in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, New York, Dallas, Orlando,
Brazil and Armenia, and is still growing. The company received the largest
initial round of funding in history, with $200M from GTCR Golder Rauner
(Chicago) and Greylock (Boston) and has achieved critical milestones at a
dramatic rate: signing its first Global 1000 customer within its first month
of operation, completing beta product development in four months, and fully
staffing each and every one of its core management roles.
Brience provides the universal delivery platform for the Adaptive Web,
offering solutions that let companies easily extend their e-Business reach
to customers and employees and allow them to take advantage of new
Web-enabled business opportunities. Brience solutions are based on open,
global standards, allowing businesses to adapt their infrastructures to
changing market conditions quickly and with minimal risk. Through its
relationships with the leading visionaries of the Internet Infrastructure,
Brience ensures its customers have access to the best wireless and broadband
solutions available from the companies that are driving the future of
e-Business.

Given recent press releases, it seems as if the governor is suggesting that 
the use of ""real-time meters"" be increased so as to give correct price 
signals to customers.

Do you--or any sources in California--know if they foresee increasing the 
on-peak charge?  This would effectively result in only commercial and

By Mark Golden
  
10/04/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- High electricity prices this summer in California were 
the result of market fundamentals and structure, rather than market 
manipulation by particular participants, according to a preliminary report by 
the California Power Exchange. 
Rising demand in the state and in the western U.S. overall combined with a 
lack of new generators to push wholesale prices to levels about three times 
as high as prices last summer, according to the preliminary report obtained 
by Dow Jones Newswires. 
And the price rise was predictable, according to the report. 
Citing hot weather from May to July in California and the Southwest, lower 
hydroelectric supplies in the Northwest, higher natural gas prices, higher 
prices for nitrogen oxide emission allowances, the report says that ""reserve 
margins during peak hours in May and June in the Western Systems Coordinating 
Council region dropped to a thin 4% to 6%, compared to the forecast 17% to 
20%."" 
""Price movements in California and the WSCC are consistent with analysis by 
Cambridge Energy Research Associates, which has demonstrated a high 
correlation between low capacity reserve margins and high spot prices in 
other regions of the U.S.,"" the report says. 
While the CalPX recommends changes to its market rules, it says that prices 
were sometimes higher in other parts of the western U.S. than in California 
this summer, further evidence of a genuine market imbalance between supply 
and demand. 
The CalPX market flaws, however, ""provided incentives to suppliers to 
speculate on receiving higher prices in the Real-Time and Ancillary Services 
markets (which are operated by the California Independent System Operator) by 
moving their supply to those markets, leaving less supply in the CalPX 
Day-Ahead market. These design flaws need to be addressed,"" the report says. 
Although suppliers had incentives to move power to the highest-priced 
markets, the CalPX found no ""consistent pattern by individual participants or 
participant category. As a result, it is difficult to single out any one 
group as the force driving prices."" 
CalPX will send the final report to various bodies investigating the 
California wholesale electricity market, including the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, the California Public Utilities Commission, the 
California Attorney General, the California Electricity Oversight Board and 
the state legislature. 
Its findings may not sit well politically with some of those bodies, 
according to one source. California utilities, Gov. Gray Davis, and various 
legislators and regulators have been blaming independent power generators - 
""out-of-state"" companies that bought big generating stations from the 
utilities over the past three years - for market manipulation and price 
gouging. Those groups hope to build a case with the FERC that would force 
suppliers to refund some of their big gains this summer back to California's 
utilities and to the customers in the San Diego area, who have received high 
electric bills. 
Instead, the CalPX's preliminary report proposes corrections that are 
relatively modest, such as increasing demand responsiveness, removing 
barriers to new generation, proportionally allocating out-of-market purchase 
costs to the utilities that underscheduled power purchases and encouraging 
utilities to buy more power in the forward market. 
As ordered by state legislation to deregulate the electric utility industry 
in California, the regulated utility units of PG&E Corp (PCG), Edison 
International (EIX) and Sempra Energy (SRE) purchase the power they need one 
day in advance through the CalPX and make any last-minute purchases through 
the California ISO.

with firm but not oppressive tannins to produce a wine that feels silky but

1998 Opus One-(95) Still in barrel.  Almost black in color.  Smells very 
young and jammy.  Has gobs of youthful berry fruit.  Just a scamp now, but 
already rich, complex and opulent.  Should be very fine some day

*PG&E <PCG.N> SAYS PACIFIC G&E FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 VOLUNTARY
BANKRUPTCY RELIEF


NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which is 
California's largest investor-owned utility and has been struggling with that 
state's power crisis, said on Friday it filed a voluntary petition for 
bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern 
District of California. 

Trading was halted in PG&E shares on the New York Stock Exchange before the 
filing. They last traded at $11.36, down 2 cents. 

The Chapter 11 filing was disclosed in mirror filings by the utility and its 
parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. <PCG.N>, with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 

The utility said in the filing that it ""retains control of its assets and is 
authorized to operate its business as a debtor in possession while being 
subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court."" 

A 1996 state utility law deregulated wholesale prices but capped retail 
prices. Pacific G&E has said it accumulated more than $8.9 billion of back 
debts because a rate freeze prevents it from passing on its soaring wholesale 
power costs to consumers.

404,"Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 

The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies

We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws,"" said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. ""If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void."" 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB, news, msgs) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 

""It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract,"" Ahern said. ""It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover."" 

The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE, news, msgs) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 

The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 

The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 

The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 

CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI, news, msgs) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) and Calpine Corp. (CPN, news, msgs), according to the report. 

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

""...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.""

There is a hint of Autumn in the air.  I don=01,t know if it=01,s wishful
thinking, or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our pale
summer into a Bay Area glorious Fall.  It=01,s premature, I know.  A few
fallen leaves, the start of schools, slightly longer afternoon shadows
... I=01,m jumping the gun.  I can=01,t wait for this summer to be over,
especially this summer.  The pounding never stops, and as I hear the din
of the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature, I
can barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up: fires in
Montana restricting transmission paths, blown up interstate gas pipeline
in New Mexico, diminishing N-Ox credits for in-state power plants,
depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions for
commercial and industrial customers, credit limits restricting imports
of Canadian power into the Northwest and California, and BPA buying
about 1,000 MW to cover its short hydro position.

 I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes the
California restructured power industry.  I just want to end to the
summer, now, and start a two week Fall vacation ... anywhere, even in
Cleveland.

There are seven, count them, seven investigations into some aspect of
the wholesale power market out here.  Two days ago there were only six,
but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the Prez=01,s
request.  That means FERC has two, the PUC has two, the State Attorneys
General has two (one on the ISO Governing Board, and one on the in-state
generators), and one by the Electric Oversight Board.  If you don=01,t have
an ongoing study of the California Market, then you=01,re not hip.

All of these investigations, save FERC=01,s Section 206 Investigation, are
going to amount to near nothing.  A lot of wasted time and paper.  The
PUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished.  Now
they need some evidence to support their assertions.

And how are we holding up under all of this?  How are you doing?  I talk
to many of you throughout the week, and I know how frustrated you are.
I share your frustration.  You want to tell the public, the press, and
anyone in between the truth.  You want to lay out the facts.  You want
to show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market is
making things worse, not better.  The price caps, for example, are
damnable and screwing up the prices, much to the detriment of those
people for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against price
shocks.  Now they are receiving higher average prices.

The public isn=01,t going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite.
And let=01,s face it, when it comes to stellar public relations, our

Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at every

the new power industry, borne from the loins of either the natural-gas
industry or nuclear-power business, learned the hard way that the best
response to a public inquiry is a two-block head start in front of an
angry mob.  Keep your head down, shut your mouth, and this too shall

I don=01,t buy that approach, at least not anymore.  That is, I don=01,t
believe we have anything to hide, or of which to be ashamed.  What
electric restructuring is about is correct, beneficial to the public,
and in everyone=01,s best interests.  Look at it this way, when they pat
the last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place, for what do you
most want to be remembered?  That you caved in to the political will of
others, or at a moment when you had the chance, you did what was right
instead of what was expedient?  I think the choice is easy, albeit laced
with sheer terror.  Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids
(e.g., tell the truth, do what is right, think of the big picture and
not just yourself) are a lot easier to speak than to live by.  So join

No What-Iffing in This One =01) Sooners Turn
Longhorns Every Which Way but Loose

The Longhorns had their worst day during the Mack Brown era Saturday in
Dallas and they picked a bad time to do it because unbeaten Oklahoma scored
on its first six possessions, and, for good measure, ran a pass back for a
touchdown, too, en route to a 63-14 victory.
The Sooners dominated the Longhorns offensively, defensively and on special
teams. They even won the halftime, when a Billy Sims-led relay team beat an
Eric Metcalf-led relay team.
QB Josh Huepel passed the Longhorns to death and 5-7, 193-pound sophomore R=
B
Quentin Griffin broke Oklahoma's school scoring record =01) and Longhorn fa=
ns'
hearts =01) with six touchdowns.
In short, it just wasn't a good day to be a Texas fan =01) in the cold, dam=
p
Cotton Bowl or anywhere.
The loss dropped Texas to 4-2 for the season and 1-1 in the Big 12 and gave
the Sooners a big boost in their drive toward national and Big 12 honors.
It also made this Saturday's game with Colorado in Boulder the biggest game
of the year. This is a season on the brink. It could go up or down. Remembe=
r
that 66-3 debacle with UCLA that started the slide in John Mackovic's last
year?
Brown is made of sterner stuff and I think he can get this team back on
track. But he has to do it in a hurry.
One thing Longhorn fans need to be very thankful about is that Heupel is a
senior. He was absolutely awesome Saturday and he probably will be the best
all-around quarterback the Longhorns will face this year.
Here, even more briefly than usual, is how the game went:
FIRST QUARTER
Oklahoma won  the toss and deferred. Texas took the ball and the Sooners go=
t
the wind. A false-start penalty on the game's second snap doomed that drive
and forced a quick punt into the wind. Kris Stockton got a good roll on the
low kick to the OU 43. Heupel hit four of five passes to cover the 57 yards
in six plays to give OU a 7-0 lead with 11:37 left. TB Hodges Mitchell made=
 a
great run after catching Applewhite's third-down pass to pick up a UT first
down =01) but it was the only one in the first quarter.  On their second tr=
y,
the Sooners went 77 yards in 11 plays and ran the score to 14-0 with 3:30
left. A  holding penalty on the kickoff forced Texas to start frrom its 8.
Another three-and-out series and punt out of the end zone gave the Sooners =
a
short field at the UT 43. They were on the move again at the UT 29 when the
period ended.
SECOND QUARTER
The UT defense got a great leaping interception in the end zone from CB
Quentin Jammer, but it was disallowed and he was called for pass interferen=
ce
instead, giving OU a first down at the 2. They scored on the next play for =
a
21-0 lead with 14:24 left. Starting QB Major Applewhite almost connected wi=
th
freshman WR Roy Williams for a 45-yard completion, but the officials ruled =
he
lost the ball on the way down and it was ruled incomplete. The Horns couldn=
't
make a first down and J. T. Thatcher ran Stockton's punt back 53 yards to t=
he
UT 11. A personal foul on the runback set them back to the 26, but they
scored in two plays for a 28-0 lead with 12:40 remaining. Chris Simms came =
in
at quarterback and hit Williams for a first down, but a delay-of-game penal=
ty
negated it and Simms' next pass was intercepted by OU LB Rocky Calmus, who
returned it for still another OU touchdown and a 35-0 lead with 11:30
remaining. That brought Applewhite back in and he hit WR Montrell Flowers f=
or
a nice gain on first down, but an illegal motion penalty forced a punt. The
Sooners scored again, giving them a 42-0 lead with 4:43 left. At this point=
,
OU's offense had been so dominant that it had faced only seven first downs
all day and had converted all of them. Texas offense, meanwhile, had one
first down. The UT offense finally came to life, driving 80 yards in seven
plays to leave OU on top, 42-7, with 3:00 left. Mitchell got the TD from
seven yards out on a pass from Applewhite. The Sooners were driving again
when the half ended. It was their only drive in the first half that did not
result in a TD. At the half, OU led in first downs, 18-5, in rushing yardag=
e,
110-13, and in passing yardage, 182-106.
THIRD QUARTER
Texas finally forced OU to punt quickly to start the second half, but
Applewhite, under a big rush, threw an interception that was run back to th=
e
UT 24. OU scored in two plays for a 49-7 lead just 1:07 deep. Simms came ba=
ck
in at QB and played the rest of the way. OU again drove deep into Texas
territory, but freshman DE Kalen Thornton's sack of Heupel forced the Soone=
rs
to try a field goal and it went wide.  The Sooner's next TD came after a
fumble by WR Montrell Flowers at the UT 17. That made the score 56-7 with
1:26 left. Then Victor Ike, probably the swiftest of all the Longhorns, got
loose on the kickoff and Sooner DB Michael Thompson caught him from behind =
at
the OU 17. It was an 81-yard return. But the Horns lost four yards on two
plays and were facing third-and-4 at the OU 21 when the quarter ended.
FOURTH QUARTER
A pass interference penalty against OU gave Texas a first down at the  6.
Mitchell got five yards, then backup TB Kenny Hayter took an outside toss f=
or
the TD to make it 56-14 with 14:09 left. OU came right back for its final T=
D,
driving 73 yards, primarily on runs by Griffin.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday he accepts the blame for the big loss to
Oklahoma, and he said the Longhorns have to bounce back because they still
have a season to play and a lot of goals to accomplish if they play up to
their capabilities.
""After reviewing the film, I still stand by what I said yesterday,"" Brown
said. ""They outcoached us, they outhustled us, they outplayed us. They
totally dominated the game, and when that happens, it comes back to me. It'=
s
my fault.""
But he said the team still has a chance to repeat as the Big 12 South
champion. ""Last year, we were 1-1 (in the Big 12) at this point. We're at t=
he
same spot as we were last season.""
Asked if he thinks the team has a chance to rebound and win the title again=
,
he said, ""no question about that. We're far from out of anything. We just h=
ad
a poor, poor performance yesterday in a game that was very important for us
and our fans. For me to just throw out the season because of that would be
totally asinine.""
He noted that Oklahoma, after it's loss to Texas last year, beat Texas A&M,
51-6, the following week, and Stanford, after giving up 69 points to Texas
last year, won the Pac 10 championship and Rose Bowl berth.
""There is a lot of anger after a loss like this by our fans,"" he said. ""Wha=
t
I will do this week is not look at the paper, I won't watch TV or listen to
the radio. I'll be working hard all week trying to get us back on track.""
He said he thought the Longhorns were ready to give a good performance
against the Sooners, but he said, after three straight losses to Texas, the
Oklahoma players might have just been hungrier.
""Our seniors had a chance to beat Oklahoma four straight times,"" he said.
""Some of them were crying. Most of our younger players were in shock.""
He said a loss like this one forces coaches to re-evaluate everything. ""We'=
ll
definitely go back and look very closely at everything we're doing. We'll t=
ry
to simplify things.""
He said some of the Longhorn players played well, but he said most of them
""played hard, but didn't play well.""
""The defense had been playing so well for us,"" he said. ""It didn't even loo=
k
like the same defense. Part of it was (OU QB Josh) Heupel. He played great.=
""
""We had a lot of mental mistakes,"" Brown said. ""We just played poorly and w=
ho
knows why we played that poorly? You guys will start looking at the things =
we
should change. The fans will start looking at the things we should change.
I've got to look at things that I think will work. I've got to get them bac=
k
on track.""
Asked if he thinks there is a chance the team could fall apart because of t=
he
loss to the Sooners, Brown said, ""This team won't fall apart. It's a very
young team with a lot of heart, a lot of class. We'll go back to work to fi=
x
things, simplify things.""
He said the key thing is for him to be truthful with his players this week
about the things they did wrong, the things they did right and the goals th=
e
team still can accomplish.
""This is a bad week to be going to Boulder,"" he said, noting that Colorado
upset A&M in College Station last week. ""We won't ever forget this (OU) gam=
e,
but we still have goals to accomplish. We're still in the race for the
championship in our conference.""
""The players are embarrassed and I know I'm embarrassed, but we've got to
pull back together and get back to work. We've got to go back and make sure
we are fundamentally sound.""



10th Anniversary

This is the final issue of my 10th year of publishing True Orange. Next wee=
k
will be the first issue of my 11th year. While this is not a happy occasion
because of the football game, my first issue was after a Texas win over OU
and UT is 7-3-1 against the Sooners since True Orange began.
Thanks to all of you for your continued support.

True Orange Observations

This was one of those games where a team has to  figure out what went wrong=
,
try to correct it, and then forget it because a game like this can be a
cancer that ruins a season. Remember UCLA, 66-3, and 1997?
Mack Brown won't ask for my suggestions on this, and I'm sure he can figure
it out for himself, but if I were in his shoes, here is what I would do rig=
ht
now:
1. Give a royal chewing out to my players, my assistants and myself, becaus=
e
this game was an embarrassment to all Longhorns. Then I would say there are=
 a
lot of games left to play and this game needs to be put on the shelf and th=
e
Colorado game should be the start of a new season for a team with a lot of
goals left to accomplish.
2. Figure out the few things that have worked on offense and build future
game plans around them. By the same token, I'd figure out the plays that
haven't worked and quit using them. The two up-the-gut plays the Horns used
on their first two plays Saturday for zero yards have been unproductive all
year. Texas rarely has a running play outside the tackles, but the sweeps
usually work when they are tried. I'd also ditch that sideline pass that
travels 30 yards for a potential 1-yard gain =01) or an interception for a =
TD =01)
and start throwing downfield more often. To open the game against Oklahoma
State, the Longhorns had a four-yard run and two pass completions on their
first three plays and didn't pick up a first down.
3. Pick a QB and go with him. Each QB has to be nervous, knowing that if he
throws an interception, he'll be jerked.
4. Quit being so predictable on offense. Example: when the Horns line up in=
 a
two-back offense and the tailback goes in motion, Texas has passed or been
sacked trying to pass 100% of the time this season. There has been one run =
by
a UT fullback all year =01) Brett Robin's touchdown in mop-up duty against =
OSU.
That formation invites an all-out blitz.
5. If the run isn't going to be a big part of the offense, go to the shotgu=
n
with four wideouts as the basic formation. It gives the quarterback a bette=
r
chance to complete his passes, as OU QB Josh Heupel demonstrated to near
perfection Saturday.
Game Notes . .
* Oklahoma QB Josh Heupel, one of the nation's top passers, had 34 net yard=
s
rushing Saturday, which was more than the 20 yards gained by the Longhorns'
leading ground gainer, TB Hodges Mitchell.
* This was the second most one-sided game in the series, trailing only the
50-0 Oklahoma victory in in 1908. Texas leads the series, 55-35-5.
* The Sooners 534 yards and 28 first downs are both school records against
the Longhorns.
* This was the fifth most one-sided defeat in Texas history. The bottom 10
are:
1.  1904    at Chicago      68-0
2.  1997    UCLA            66-3
3.  1988    Houston     66-15
4.  1908    at Oklahoma 50-0
5.  2000    Oklahoma        63-14
6.  1901    at Kirksville   48-0
7.  1956    at TCU          46-0
8.  1906    at Vanderbilt   45-0
9.  1956    Oklahoma        45-0
10. 1991    Miami           46-3

Baseball Team Starts Practice

The Longhorn baseball begins fall practice Wednesday with 12 lettermen back
from last year's team that qualified for the College World Series.
The team will practice through Oct. 27, and the annual Fall World Series wi=
ll
be played from Oct. 25 through Oct. 27.
All the practices will be open at Disch-Falk Field, and all the practices
will be in the afternoon, but exact times have not been announced.
Coach Augie Garrido and his assistants corraled the nation's fifth-rated
recruiting class last year, and there are several pitchers in the new class
who should be able to help the team this year.

422,"Scouting Missouri

Texas will play at Missouri Saturday in a game that will start at 1 p.m. and,
despite prior announcements, will not be televised - not even on a pay per
view basis.
The Longhorns, ranked No. 7 in both polls, are 6-1, while the Tigers are
unranked at 3-3.
Missouri opened the season with a 20-13 loss to Bowling Green, then thumped
Southwest Texas, 40-6, before getting mauled by Nebraska, 36-3.
Then the Tigers beat Oklahoma State, 41-38, in a triple overtime, before
losing to Iowa State, 20-14, and then outscoring Kansas 38-34.
Tiger QB Kirk Farmer has had a hot hand in recent weeks, and he kept both
teams in the game last week, blistering Kansas with 246 yards and three
touchdowns passing, plus another 82 rushing yards. But he also had two
interceptions run back for touchdowns.
Farmer, a 6-5, 210-pound junior, has completed 73 of 147 passes for 804 yards
and 8 touchdowns, but he was very productive in the Tigers' three most recent
games.
He also is a slippery runner who is a great scrambler.
WR Justin Gage, a 6-5, 205-pound junior, is one of the nation's most
productive pass receivers. He has caught 45 passes for 518 yards and 3 TDs
and ranks second in the Big 12 in receptions per game with a 7.5 average.
RB Zack Abron, a 5-10, 230-pound sophomore,  is the main threat on the
ground. He has rushed 94 times for 453 yards and 5 TDs. That's an average of
4.8 yards per carry.
New coach Gary Pinkel inherited eight offensive and six defensive starters
from a 3-8 team, and he has shifted players around, particularly on defense,
to try to get more speed on the field.
I had to use Big 8 statistics in my team comparisons this week because the
NCAA defensive statistics and rankings were not available at press time.
As you can see from the statistics below, the Longhorns appear to be far
superior to the Tigers.
This is a game the Longhorns should win and will win if they:
1. Avoid costly turnovers
2. Keep on running the ball to provide more offensive balance
3. Get their usual great defensive game.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (Big 12 rank in parenthesis):
Texas                    Missouri

Big 12 Roundup

The Big 12 is down to two teams with perfect records and one of those will
fall Saturday when Nebraska plays host to Oklahoma.
Both unbeaten powerhouses struggled in their games last week, undoubtedly
because their thoughts kept drifting to the big showdown in Lincoln.
Iowa State travels to Texas A&M in another key conference game because both
clubs are 3-1 in league play.

Buckman Close to Decision

Brad Buckman, the 6-8 Austin Westlake forward who is the object of the big
recruiting battle between Texas and North Carolina, is very close to making
his choice.
In fact, two North Carolina internet sites claim he has already made it and
the Tar Heels are the winners.
Buckman isn't saying. He says he has always been a Texas fan, but really
likes North Carolina and the ACC because basketball is so important in that
area.

Top Women Visit

Center LaToya Davis, 6-2, of Houston South Houston, took her official visit
to Texas last weekend after visiting Texas Tech the previous week.
Davis, the state's top uncommitted player, has narrowed her choices to those
two schools and is expected to make her decision this week.
Three top juniors also took unofficial visits to Texas the same weekend. They
are Kalee Carey, 6-5, of Canyon, 6-1 Destiny Drew of Crosby and 6-0 Emily
Niemann of Houston Westbury Christian.


UT Men, Women Picked 5th

The Longhorns aren't getting alot of respect in basketball.
The Texas men and women were both picked to finish fifth in a poll of Big 12
coaches last week.
The men's coaches picked 6-8 Chris Owens to the All-Big 12 first team and
tabbed 5-11 freshman point guard T. J. Ford as co-newcomer of the year.
The women's coaches didn't name any Longhorns to their honor teams, which
probably was a mistake because the Longhorn women were headed toward a very
good season last year when a rash of injuries destroyed their chances.
With an outstanding group of incoming recruits, the Longhorn women will have
much more depth this year.

Turnover Troubles

Texas is 6-1 and Colorado is 5-2. You knew that, didn't you?
But did you know that in the two games Colorado lost, the Buffaloes suffered
nine turnovers (five against Fresno State and four against Texas) and did not
cause a single one?
 And did you know that in the game the Longhorns lost they gave up four
turnovers against Oklahoma without gaining a single one?
What that statistic proves is that going 0-13 in turnovers is a really
sure-fire formula for going 0-3 in games.

Football Practice Roundup

Coach Mack Brown put the Longhorns through a different kind of two-a-day
workouts this year and he and the players both think it is the way to go in
the future.
With the wave of football-related deaths hitting the pros, the colleges and
the high schools, he decided to only have one workout on days when the team
worked during the hottest time of the day.
A typical week of practice included 8:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. workouts on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday, and 3 p.m. workouts on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
Brown said it kept the players fresher (and safer) and he also said they will
be better prepared to start the season.
""They handled the heat really well, and worked hard in every practice,"" he
said. ""We've had some problems early in the season since I've been here, and
I think this kind of schedule gives us a better chance to be stronger at the
start of the season.""
Brown had three game-type scrimmages during the pre-season work.
The final one went about 90 minutes last Wednesday night before about 4,000
fans and the first-team offense and first-team defense were dominant.
""The ones were dominant,"" Brown said, ""and that's the way you want it. We ran
the ball well and threw it and caught it well, and we played good defense for
the most part.""
The first-team defense had five QB sacks, with LBs Tyrone Jones and Everick
Rawls, DEs Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding and DT Maurice Gordon getting one
each.
Gordon got most of the first-team snaps at DT opposite Marcus Tubbs.
Brown said Tubbs has won a starting job, but the other DT spot is still up
for grabs.
Freshman Stevie Lee also looked good working with the second team at DT and
going against the first-team line. He appears to be recovered from off-season
foot surgery. He is a run stopped deluxe who is getting better at rushing the
passer.
Freshman RB Cedric Benson, running primarily with the second team, had his
best scrimmage. He gained 75 yards on 13 carries.
His was very impressive on a four-play 26-yard drive with the second team
against a mixture of first-and-second-team defenders.
He carried the ball four straight times, getting 6 and then 5 to set up a
first down at the 15, then bolting 14 yards on a draw play, breaking several
tackles along the way. He scored easily on the next play from the 1.
Benson seems to have better vision and be quicker through holes than the
other Longhorn backs. It also takes great penetration by the defense to keep
the heralded freshman from making positive yardage.
The Longhorns worked primarily on the running game in the final scrimmage.
Brown has said several times that UT must run the ball better in big games
and he said after the scrimmage he is encouraged by the way the backs are
running and the linement are blocking.
He was asked after the scrimmage why TE Bo Scaife has not been involved more
in the passing game. ""We know Bo can catch and make things happen after he
catches it,"" Brown said. ""We've been working Bo more on runs because he needs
to work on his blocking. That's the area where he needs to improve.""
Brown also said at least three freshmen will play in the opener Sept. 1
against New Mexico State - Benson, outside linebacker Derrick Johnson and
walk-on kicker Dusty Mangum.
Asked why they are assured of playing, Brown laughed and said, ""Cedric is
really, really productive. Derrick is 6-5, 215 and he runs really fast. Dusty
has been doing a good job in an area that was a problem for us in the
spring.""
He also said Mangum will be the place-kicker and also might kick off.

Baseball Prospects Promising

The Longhorn baseball team begins fall workouts in September with most of its
top performers returning, plus a great group of new players.
Iowa State dropped baseball after last season and the Longhorns got the
Cyclones' ace pitcher, Alan Bomar, a hard-throwing right-hander who was one
of the top hurlers in the Big 12 last year.
They also signed two other pitchers who will compete for starting jobs. They
are Brad Halsey, a left-hander from Hill County JC who throws in the lows
90s, and Jesin Merrle, a right-hander from Navarro JC with a fine assortment
of pitches.
Five pitchers who saw a lot of action last year also return. They are Ray
Clark, Ryan France, Justin Simmons, Eugene Espineli and Bradley Jordan.
Ryan Hubele returns at catcher and Jeff Ontiveros will be at first base. Both
hit with power.
Speedy Timmy Moss is back at second base and prize freshman Michael Holliman
of Dallas Jesuit, who turned down a pro offer of more than $1 million to come
to Texas, probably will be at shortstop.
Omar Quintinilla, who suffered severe facial injuries in a collision with a
teammate last season, was having a great year at bat when the season-ending
injury occurred.
He played shortstop last year as a freshman, but will move to third base and
will add some pop to the batting lineup.
Another top middle infielder is Brandon Fahey, of Duncanville and Grayson
County JC. He is an outstanding hitter who could be the designated hitter if
he doesn't win a starting job.
Starting outfielders Ben King, Kaloni Napolean and Matt Rosenberg all return,
along with Eric Sultemeir, who played a lot as a freshman last season.
The Horns also added a top centerfielder in Joe Ferin of Westark JC. He was
All-Big 12 as a freshman at Iowa State in 1999 before transferring to Westark
for the 2000 season.
He has outstanding speed and is a fine hitter.
The Longhorns made it to the regional finals last year. With Quintinilla
returning healthy and the other returning starters, plus the influx of new
talent, this team has the potential to be much better.

Soccer Team Starts Strong

The Texas women's soccer team completed a 6-0-1 wing of Europe last week with
a 3-2 victory over Saestrum, the Dutch  League Champion, in Zeist, Utrecht,
NL.
The UT team, ranked No. 18 nationally, had three shutouts in the seven
matches and outscored their opponents by a 32-6 margin.
Leading the Longhornsoffensively in Europe were freshmen Kelly Wilson of
Odessa Permian and Kristen Teter of Kingwood, who finished the trip ranked 
first and second on the club,  respectively, in points scored with 14 and 12.
Wilson led the Horns with five goals and she and Teter tied for the team lead
in  assists with four.
Teter and sophomore Kylee Wosnuk of Folsom, California, tied for second on
the squad with four goals each during UT's European trip.
Up next, head coach Chris Petrucelli and theLonghorns officially kick off the
2001 campaign at 7 p.m. Friday at  Mike A. Myers Stadium and Soccer Field
against consensus No. 1 and  defending national champion North Carolina.
Tickets for individual matches are on sale through UTTM at (512) 477-6060 or
1-800-982-BEVO, while season tickets may be purchased by calling (512)

 Longhorns Favored by 42 in Season Opener,
But New Mexico State Will Test Run Defense

Coach Mack Brown and the Longhorn players hope they are back among the
nation's elite teams, but they won't find out Saturday night when they
entertain the 42-point underdog New Mexico State Aggies.
The 6 p.m. game will be televised nationally by Fox, and the sellout crowd
and all those television viewers should see a Longhorn romp, and they also
will find out those new defensive tackles are shaping up.
Texas led the Big 12 Conference in rushing defense last year, allowing only
93.4 yards a game and 2.6 yards a carry.
New Mexico State won only three games last year and the Aggies started this
season on a losing note, falling to Louisville, 45-24.
But they outgained the Cardinals, 544-373, and lost primarily because they
fumbled twice deep in Louisville territory and both fumbles were returned for
Cardinal touchdeowns.
RB Kenton Keith, who rushed for 849 yards last season, had 22 carries for 137
yards and led the Aggies to a 24-23 halftime lead before the two long fumble
returns turned the game around in the second half.
The Aggies were No. 7 in the country in rushing last year and the year before
with their power-option attack, and they will give those new Longhorn defense
tackles an early test.
QB K. C. Enzminger also can run. He picked up 450 yards rushing last season
while passing for 1,457 more yards and 15 touchdowns.
The New Mexico State defense gives up lots of yards and lots of points when
it is on the field, but the Aggie offense, when it gets rolling like it did
in the first half at Louisville, can control the ball for long periods in the
game.
Sophomore Marcus Tubbs and the other young defensive tackles will bear a
major responsibility in handling the Aggie inside option.
They have looked good in practice, but facing an option attack is such a
rarity these days that it's difficult to practice for it.
Most of the top teams the Longhorns will play this year are pass-first,
run-second teams. In fact, some of them are pass-first, pass-second and
pass-third team who hardly ever run.
That's what makes this game so interesting, even if it should be a blowout,
because the one thing New Mexico State does well is run the football.
But that's enough on the opponents. Let's look at the Longhorns, their No. 5
national ranking, and their chances of keeping it.
No one in college football will have a receiving corps to match the
Longhorns, particularly when the wide receivers and tight ends are lumped
together.
The top three wide receivers and top two tight ends, all sophomores by the
way, are outstanding.
Few teams in college football have a defensive secondary to equal UT's, and
there probably isn't a better pass-blocking offensive line in the Big 12.
The defensive line lost outstanding tackles Casey Hampton, an All-American,
and Shaun Rogers, but it should again be very good with DEs Cory Redding and
Kalen Thornton leading the way.
Redding, a junior, and Thornton, a sophomore, both started and played very
well as true freshmen. Both are bigger and stronger this season, and look
ready to have outstanding seasons.
Tubbs played a lot last year as a redshirt freshman because Rogers had a
badly sprained ankle that limited his play for much of the year.
He played well then and has looked like a budding star in two-a-days.
The coaches say they are worried about the other defensive tackle position,
but good coaches always say they are worried unless their names are Steve
Spurrier or Bob Stoops.
But redshirt freshman Stevie Lee has been looking very good against the run
in recent practices, and senior Maurice Gordon is an outstanding pass rusher
who also plays the run pretty well.
Sophomore Adam Doiron, who is a good run stopper, also figures to see a lot
of playing time.
The offensive line has been working harder this spring on run blocking
because head coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns ""have to be able to run the
ball when we want to run it.""
He says a dependable running game makes it harder to stop the Horns' lethal
passing weapons, helps in running the clock when protecting a lead, and last
but not least, helps the defense by giving it more time to rest.
One constant in the Longhorns' three losses last season was the incredible
number of three-and-out possessions by the offense.
Against Oklahoma, for example, Texas had one first down when the Sooners
scored their sixth touchdown.
Even in the big victory over A&M, the Longhorns had just one first down in
the entire first half, and the stout UT defense obviously tired in the third
quarter, but it didn't matter because Texas scored four touchdowns in the
period to blow the game open.
That shouldn't happen this season. The line has worked harder on run
blocking, and the four returning line starters finally have enough experience
to function better as a unit.
It also shouldn't happen because the running back corps looks so much
stronger than it was last year when it started and ended with Hodges Mitchell.
Junior Victor Ike, one of the fastest backs around, is bigger and stronger
and determined to hold the starting job.
But 245-pound sophomore Ivan Williams, always a terror in the spring and a
bust in the fall, must be smelling spring flowers because he has been a
terror throughout two-a-day workouts.
And then there is true freshman Cedric Benson. I know now how Florida fans
must have felt when they first set eyes on Emmitt Smith. This young man is
something special.
He's lightning-quick to the line, and he has such great vision that he always
seems to find the soft spot. He also is hard to bring down.
In other words, he has a lot of the same assets that made guys like Ricky
Williams, Earl Campbell and Roosevelt Leaks such great Longhorn backs.
Williams and Campbell both won the Heisman Trophy and Leaks would have if he
hadn't suffered a devastating knee injury after finishing third in the
Heisman voting as a junior.
Ike will start Saturday night, but look for Williams and Benson to get a lot
of carries, too.
The coaches say QB Chris Simms, FB Matt Trissel and the linebackers are all
much improved over last season. Let's hope they are right.
That doesn't leave much except kicking and special teams, and those could be
problems this season.
Junior college transfer Brian Bradford has won the punting job and he always
gets great height and usually gets great length. I'd rather have the height,
because line-drive punts often lead to long returns.
As long as he doesn't get any blocked, the Horns should be fine in the
punting game.
Freshman walk-on Dusty Mangum of Mesquite has won the place-kicking job, and
he has been very accurate in practice up to 40 yards.
But if you watched Oklahoma Saturday, the Sooners didn't look as potent on
offense as last year, but they had a killer kicking game to go along with a
killer defense.
The Horns should have a good punting game and they probably will have pretty
good success in kicking field goals and kicking off.
But they had better dominate in other areas when they play teams that have
kicking games like Oklahoma or they will be in trouble.
Bobby Bowden has won two national titles at Florida State, and he would have
won twice that many if he had a kicker like Phil Dawson or Kris Stockton.
Remember ""wide right"" and those chip-shot misses that cost him two perfect
seasons?
Mangum could be a good kicker. He's a remarkable find for a walk-on, but
making kicks like Dawson and Stockton made is a lot to ask from any walk-on.
Brown plans to announce his starting lineups later today, but there is little
suspense with 17 starters returning and replacements already in place at most
of the other spots.
When you carry a No. 5 national ranking into the season, you obviously have a
lot going for you.
That is the case with the Longhorns, but they have some areas where
improvement is mandatory if they want to keep that lofty spot and possibly
improve upon it.
Junior QB Chris Simms led the Big 12 in passing efficiency last year, but he
also had a problem with interceptions.
The Longhorns couldn't run the ball when they had to in the big games they
lost last year.
What are the chances for improvements in those two areas?
Simms has looked better during the pre-season at throwing the ball away
instead of forcing it into a crowd. If he can improve his
touchdowns-to-interceptions ratio to 2-to-1 or even 3-to-1, this should be a
great season.
The increased emphasis on the running game and the bigger backs and the quick
way Benson has adapted to the college game will improve the  team in that
area.
The key here will be for the line to open more holes.
Defensively, the loss of the two tackles is the big problem and Tubbs and the
other three players mentioned earlier should be able to fill those holes.
Against passing teams, they probably will be better than last year's tackles
because Rogers was never completely healthy after the ankle sprain in the
Houston game and and Hampton was more of a run stopper than a pass rusher.
So, if Simms can be more consistent in big games, if the offensive line can
block better for the run and if the kicking game holds up, this Longhorn team
has a chance to be in the Rose Bowl playing for the national title in January.
But breakdowns in any of those areas could again break Longhorn hearts and
dreams.
If you want to know how I think it will all come out, I'm going to chicken
out. I think the Longhorns are going to be a top 10 team for sure, and I
think they have a chance to make it to the Rose Bowl.
But so do several other teams, including three or four others in the Big 12.
Texas will have to go 11-0 and beat Oklahoma to win the Big 12 South, then
topple Nebraska or Kansas State or whoever emerges in the North to make it to
Pasadena.
There are lots of other teams out there who also have legitimate shots at the
Rose Bowl, including Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas State, Florida, Miami and
Oregon, the Longhorns' conqueror in the Holiday Bowl.
Oklahoma was rated No. 19 at this time last year and the Sooners won the
national title, going 13-0 in the process and beating Kansas State twice.
A similar scenario could play out this year. The Longhorns have to take care
of business better than they have in a long time to make it to Pasadena.
But two teams will get there, and one of them could be the Longhorns. That's
what makes this season so interesting for all orange-blooded football fans.
The game this week won't answer many questions, but it will show us with of
the problem areas has improved and which of them are still problems.
All teams have some problems. The ones with the fewest usually wind up
playing for all the marbles.
Let's hope the Longhorns are problem solvers deluxe this season.

Football Notes . .
Dan Smith, the junior college transfer who handled the kickoff duties against
New Mexico State, is from Charles City, Iowa, and Waldforf JC in Iowa. He was
booting them out of the end zone in pre-game drills, but tailed off slightly
in the game. The coaches like his leg strength and the height he gets on his
kicks. He wears No. 33.
* * * *
The guy who used to wear No. 33 is junior RB Kenny Hayter. He has transferred
to TCU and will have two season to play after sitting out this year to
establish his eligibility.
* * * *
Freshman walk-on kicker Dusty Mangum of Mesquite was named the Big 12
Conference Special Teams Player of the Week after setting a UT freshman debut
scoring record for a kicker with 11 points. He was 2-for-2 on field goals and
5-for-5 on extra points. His two field goals also tied Jeff Ward's 1983
freshman debut record in that category.
* * * *
True freshmen who played Saturday, in addition to Mangum, were RB Cedric
Benson, LBs Derrick Johnson and Aurmon Satchell and WR Brian Carter. Satchell
enrolled in January after signing last year. Coach Mack Brown said unless a
rash of injuries changes his plans, all of the other freshmen except possibly
one defensive back will redshirt.
* * * *
The Longhorns have won nine straight games in Royal Memorial Stadium. That is
their longest home winning streak since 1984.
* * * *
The coaches named OLs Mike Williams and Antwan Kirk-Hughes the outstanding
offensive players, LB Everick Rawls, CB Rod Babers and DE Kalen Thornton the
outstanding defensive performers and safety Phillip Geiggar the top special
team player in the season opener.

UT Has 7 Commitments, Including At Least 3 Super Blues

The Longhorns are leading the Big 12 in recruiting for the fourth straight
year after racking up seven commitments in May and June.
Headlining the commitments are two players who are on one or more national
top 100s this year and a junior college star who was on virtually all of the
national top 100s last year.
The current top national 100 guys are DTs Earl Anderson, 6-3, 265, 4.8, of
San Marcos, and Lyle Sendlein, 6-4, 260, 4.8, of Scottsdale, Ariz., Chaparral.
Anderson, who is as explosive at the line of scrimmage of any tackle I have
seen this year, committed on May 28, and Sendlein, who is so quick he plays
middle linebacker on a team that is 28-0 the last two seasons, committed on
June 2.
The junior college star is DT Sonny Davis, 6-1, 325, 5.0, formerly of Austin
Lanier and currently of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi. He signed with Texas
last year, but failed to qualify academically and enrolled in a JC. He says
he is ahead of schedule academically and hopes to be able to graduate in
December and enroll at Texas in January so he can go through spring training
Coach Mack Brown said signing defensive linemen was his No. 1 priority in
this year's recruiting class, and this trio gives him a great start toward
accomplishing that goal.
The Longhorns' first commitment was from outstanding run blocker Brett
Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.2, of Brownwood on April 7.
The commitments since my last newsletter are athlete Clint Haney, 5-11, 185,
4.27 (Nike camp time at A&M), of Smithson Valley, and QB Billy Don Malone,
6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7,of Paris North Lamar, both on June 11, and WR Dustin
Miksch, 6-0, 167, 4.35 (Nike camp time at A&M), of Round Rock Westwood on
June 14.
While the more recent commitments are not as heralded as the earlier ones,
they obviously were impressive at UT's summer camps. Donald Burgs, the
outstanding cornerback from Houston Madison, told me last Wednesday night
that Miksch was the best wide receiver at the camp that ended earlier that day
.
The following day, Miksch committed to the Longhorns.
It also didn't hurt that Miksch ran a 4.35 40 at the A&M Nike camp and a 4.4
at the UT camp and Haney ran a 4.27 40 at the same Nike camp and a 4.4 at the
Texas camp.
Malone is not as much of a sleeper as the other two. He's a two-time Class 4A
All-District quarterback and safety, and he was the sophomore of the year in
the district both offensively and defensively.
He has receivers who can catch the ball, but they don't dazzle anyone with
their speed. When defensive backs aren't worried about receivers' speed, they
cover them as tightly as they can, knowing that if they lose a step, it will
be easy to get it back.
That makes the quarterback's job a lot harder and can lead to more
interceptions. But Malone completed 106 of 202 passes (52.4%) for 1,649 yards
and 15 touchdowns for a 6-4 team. He had seven interceptions. He also ran for
405 yards and four touchdowns.
Malone said he chose Texas over Tennessee, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa State,
TCU and SMU. He said ISU, TCU and SMU had offered, and North Lamar head coach
Tom Felty said Tennessee, Arkansas and Colorado coaches had told him they
were preparing to offer.
""He has a great arm,"" Felty said, ""but what really makes him special is the
way he sees the entire field. He can find his second and third receivers and
he never just locks onto one guy.""
""He's also a very physical player,"" Felty said.  ""That's what makes him such
a fine free safety, and it also helps him at quarterback because he will hang
in there until the last split second to get a completion even when he knows
he's going to get decked.""
Haney said he picked the Longhorns over Texas Tech and Colorado (offers) and
several other schools who  were recruiting him.
He rushed 266 times for 1,665 yards (6.25 yards per carry) and 19 touchdowns,
and also was a big threat as a receiver, catching 9 passes for 205 yards and
four touchdowns for the 11-2 Rangers.
He said when he committed, ""Coach Brown said they were recruiting me as a
football player. He told me they want fast, athletic kids and they would find
a spot for me after I get there.""
That spot probably will be wide receiver or defensive back.
Smithson Valley defeated San Marcos in the Class 4A playoffs last year, and
Haney said San Marcos' defensive tackle Earl Anderson, another UT pledge, ""is
really fast to be so big. I broke about a 40-yard touchdown run in that game
and he was right behind me most of the way. I'm glad we're going to be on the
same side at Texas.""
In addition to those fast 40 times Miksch ran at the summer camps, he also
blazed to  a 10.53 100 meters last track season.
Miksch, the son of former Longhorn WR Ronnie Miksch, a 1977-78 letterman from
Needville, said Purdue, Nebraska, A&M, Notre Dame and Oklahoma were all
recruiting him.
He said Purdue and Nebraska coaches had invited him to their summer camps.
""I'll have to call both of them and tell them I won't be coming to their
camps,"" he said.
He caught 46 passes for 676 yards and five touchdowns for the 4-6 Warriors
last season.
When Anderson and Sendlein committed earlier, along with Davis' recommitment,
it gave the Longhorns a fine start toward a great defensive line class.
All three are physical players who have great quickness to go with their size
and athleticism. They also all play very hard all the time.
Anderson is the highest ranked Texas blue-chipper to pick a college. He is
No. 3 on my 25-man ""difference-maker"" list. Sendlein is the top recruit in
Arizona and, if he lived in Texas, he would be high in my top 25. Davis was
No. 5 on my ""difference maker"" list last year.
Anderson, who says he has grown an inch to 6-4 and now weighs 275, told me
can still break 4.8 in the 40 on most days.
""I ran a  4.78 the last time I was clocked,"" he said. ""I want to stay below
4.8, so I'm watching my weight now."" I was the first guy to give him a high
ranking after seeing his incredible quickness last season.
He said he picked Texas over Texas A&M, Florida State and others because UT
""has the great combination of athletics and academics that I want and it's so
close that my parents won't have to spend a lot of money traveling around to
see me play.""
Besides that, he said, ""I've always been a Longhorn fan.""
Sendlein comes from such a Longhorn family that his UT linebacker brother is
named Austin. Their father, Robin, was a great linebacker at Texas and also
played in the NFL for many years.
Sendlein said he is 6-5, 275, and can run the 40 in 4.8. His Scottsdale team
has gone 14-0 two straight years and his prowess as a defender is one of the
main reasons for the team's success.
Sendlein was being recruited by all the top schools in the Pac 10, plus Notre
Dame, Nebraska, Michigan and Penn State.
* * * *
Another great defensive line prospect, Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel,
came in at 6-4 1/2 and 261 and ran a 4.8 40 at a Nike camp at LSU recently,
and he also bench pressed 185 pounds 36 times. No one else at the camp was
able to bench press 185 pounds more than 22 times. Pittman bench pressed 440
pounds, a tremendous achievement for a high school junior, at a recent
charity fund raising event at Evangel.
He is the younger brother of Cole Pittman, the former UT defensive linemen
who was killed in a tragic auto accident earlier this year while returning to
Texas for spring training. He is considering Texas and LSU.
Chase and his father, Marc Pittman, came to one of the Longhorn camp sessions
on June 6, and several other Evangel stars accompanied them, including John
David Booty, a  6-2, 195-pound quarterback who might be the nation's top
sophomore prospect, and another outstanding sophomore, DE Chris Bowers, 6-3,
232, 4.6. He also brought two top Evangel defensive backs who are being
highly recruited from Evangel. They are Jonathan Wade, 5-10, 175, 4.3 (he ran
a 10.25 100 meters in April), and Chad Johnson, 5-11, 185, 4.4.

RECRUITING NOTES: Trivia Question - The speed-rushing DE Longhorn coaches and
their cohors everywhere want to sign lives 550 miles or so northeast of
Austin, but his grandmother and two uncles live in Austin and he took an u
nofficial visit to Austin recently. Who is he? If you guessed Bryan Pickryl,
6-5, 230, 4.5, of Jenks (suburban Tulsa), Oklahoma, you are a certified
recruiting junkie. Pickryl has lived in Oklahoma all his life, but his father
is a UCLA grad and he says his top two schools right now are Texas and UCLA.
Look for the Sooners to be a big player here, but they will have to hurry
because he is planning to graduate in December and enroll in the college of
his choice in January. He's the top player in Oklahoma and one of the truly
great outside pass rushers in the country. . . My list on page 4 has quite a
few new names because the May evaluations by college coaches produced some
new top prospects. . . The Longhorns might sign as many as six or seven
defensive linemen and as many as four  offensive linemen in this recruiting
class because the talent base is so strong in both areas. The top offensive
line prospects the Horns are hustling are Justin Blaylock of Plano East, Tony
Ugoh of Spring Westfield and Neale Tweedie of Allen. The top defensive line
hopes include tackles Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Kasey Studdard of
Highlands Ranch, Colo., Marco Martin of Mesquite and Joseph Edwards of Dayton
and the top ends, in addition to Pittman and Pickryl, are Travis Leitko of
The Woodlands, Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Dontriel Coates of Anahuac.
Coates has only played football the last two seasons, but he has great
quickness and intensity.

Baseball Roundup

Shorstop Omar Quintanilla  and pitcher Justin Simmons have been named to
Collegiate Baseball's Louisville Slugger Freshmen All-American Team.
This marks the first time Texas has had two freshman All-Amercians in the
same year.
The Longhorns were seeded third in the NCAA sub regional at Stanford in late
May. They upset No. 2 seed Long Beach State, 11-2, then stunned top-seeded
Stanford, 4-3, in the winner's bracket finale, but Stanford came back out of
the loser's bracket to beat Texas twice on May 27.
The Cardinal won the first game, 10-9, in 10 innings, then took the nightcap,
4-3. Sophomore Longhorn pitcher Ray Clark took a 3-1 lead into the eighth
inning in the second game, but sloppy fielding and mental miscues gave
Stanford three extra outs and the Cardinal scored three times.
Stanford went on to win a regional and made the finals of the College World
Series last week before losing to Miami.
The Longhorns will lose Gerrit Simpson and Albert Montes, their top two
pitchers. Both were drafted and plan to sign. They also lost one of their top
recruits, Houston Bellaire catcher James Sweeney, to the pros.
Vincent Sinisi, the slugger from The Woodlands who was the Horns' top signee
last year, has transferred to Rice. He has had persistent problems with a rib
injury.

3 Big Horns Drafted High

All-American OT Leonard Davis was the second player chosen in the NFL draft
Friday and Longhorn All-American teammate DT Casey Hampton also went in the
first round.
Arizona picked Davis after the Atlanta Falcons traded up to get the first
choice and took Virginia Tech QB Michael Vick.
Hampton was chosen by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 19th pick in the fir=
st
round.
The Horns' other outstanding DT, Shaun Rogers, was picked in the second rou=
nd
by the Detroit Lions. He was the 61st pick overall.
The last time Texas had three players chosen in the first round was in 1982=
.
Texas coach Mack Brown noted that all three players were recruited by forme=
r
coach John Mackovic and his staff, and said he is hoping it starts a trend
that sees several Longhorns being drafted every year.
There might be a little fall off next year, but Longhorns should be very
popular with NFL teams on a regular basis beginning in 2003.
Football Notes, Observations . .
UT QB Chris Simms says he is 100% sure he will stay at Texas for his senior
year.
There had been some speculation that Simms might turn pro after this season=
,
but he said he will stick around for his senior year.
Things to watch for this season that should make a big positive difference
include:
* More weapons to pick up those short-yardage plays to keep drives alive,
like a bigger, stronger running back, a more experienced offensive line and
don't forget great targets in TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards from a two-TE
set.
* More misdirection plays, particularly reverses and quick pitches to the
outside.
* More short passes to frustrate the pass rushers and to give the Horns'
swift and elusive receivers chances to turn short passes into long gains.
Bears Maul Longhorns
The UT baseball players looked great Friday night in whipping Baylor in
Austin, but they looked lost when they went to Waco for the final two games
of their series Saturday and Sunday.
Gerritt Simpson scattered six singles and struck out 10 Friday night to giv=
e
the Horns a 5-1 triumph in the first game of the crucial series.
Ryan Brooks had three hits to pace the offense.
But the Bears got to apply the ""mercy rule"" twice in Waco, throttling the
Horns 14-4 in seven innings and 16-6 in eight innings.
Texas made seven errors in the two games in Waco and that, coupled with
spotty pitching and very little hitting, turned the two games into routs.
Nebraska (15-4)  is running away with the regular season championship, and
Baylor (14-7) and Texas (16-8) are tied for second place. Texas Tech is
fourth (14-9) and OSU is fifth (12-9).

Offensive Coordinator Interview
Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says there are two areas he always focuses
on in spring practice.
The first is replacing the seniors, and the second  ""is schematics, what we
did last season and what changes we need to make, what we should try to do
better.""
All-American LT Leonard Davis and All-Big 12 RB Hodges Mitchell were the on=
ly
senior starters on last year's offense, and he said he feels a lot better a=
bo
ut replacing Davis than he does about replacing Mitchell.
""Robbie Doane had a real good spring at left tackle,"" Davis said. ""We also
worked Derrick Dockery some at left tackle because we've got three really
good guards. Alfeo Randall (incoming JC transfer) also is a left tackle.
Considering all the possibilities, I think we'll be okay at left tackle.""
""But I don't think we solved anything this spring at tailback,"" he said. ""A=
ll
five guys did some good things, and we could play all five of them, but we
wanted somebody to step up and nobody did.""
The five tailbacks are juniors Victor Ike and Kenny Hayter, sophomores Bret=
t
Robin and Ivan Williams and redshirt freshman Sneezy Beltran.
Head coach Mack Brown said Robin had the best spring, but he said none of t=
he
five played at the level the Longhorns need their tailback to reach.
Davis concurred, saying, ""We're going into the pre-season practices with an
unsettled situation at tailback.""
""Obviously, we're going to find out what the youngster can do when he gets
here,"" he added.
The youngster, of course, needs no identification. He is Cedric Benson, the
super recruit who is finishing his senior year at Midland Lee after leading
the Rebels to three straight state 5A championships.
As for a changing some things in the overall scheme, Davis said, ""We wanted
to add more misdirection this spring and we worked on that. It's an area
where we think we can add some things that will help us.""
He said more work needs to be done on the reverses shovel passes and quick
dashes to the outside. ""Those things are not greased yet,"" he said, but I'm
glad we got to throw a lot of those things at them. It gives us some more
avenues to attack.""
Davis also said the coaches worked hard this spring on developing a running
game to pick up short-yardage situations.
""We're not going to be a team that says we have to run for a certain amount
of yardage,"" he said. ""We want to do whatever it takes to win the game, but
there are times when you have to be able to run the ball in short yardage,
particularly for first downs, on the goal line and in the fourth quarter wh=
en
we're trying to protect a lead.""
Other than the uncertainty at tailback, Davis liked what he saw this spring=
.
""Our linemen had a good spring,"" he said. ""Mike Williams at right tackle ha=
d
a great spring. I think Mike will be an outstanding right tackle this seaso=
n.
""Derrick Dockery had a really good spring at right guard,"" Davis said, ""Mat=
t
Anderson had a good spring at center and Jason Glynn got a lot of snaps
behind Matt. I'm really pleased with Jason Glynn's development.""
Davis said the line will be much better when guards Antwan Kirk-Hughes and
Tillman Holloway, who both missed the spring rehabilitating injuries, retur=
n
for pre-season practice.
""Tight end will be a really solid position,"" he said. ""Bo Scaife was able t=
o
get back into things (after knee surgery) and he had a really solid spring.
Brock Edwards is a good young tight end and we'll get Mike Jones (knee
surgery) back for the season.""
""Our young wide receivers are just going to get better and better,"" Davis
said. ""Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas all played really well =
as
true freshmen and now they're a year older and more experienced.""
He also said walk-on Kyle Shanahan, redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and seni=
or
Montrell Flowers also will see a lot of action.
Shanahan is the son of the Denver Broncos' head coach and was a starter on =
a
scholarship at Duke before deciding to transfer and walk on at Texas becaus=
e
he wants to be a coach and felt this was the best place to learn the trade.
After sitting out last season, Shanahan is a junior and he catches the ball
as well as anybody on the team.
""This is a really solid group, with very good players and quality depth,""
Davis said. ""We're really pleased with our wide receivers.""
""At quarterback,"" he said, ""you would be hard pressed to find anybody who h=
as
two like we do.""
They are junior starter Chris Simms and senior Major Applewhite, who
shattered most of Texas' passing records before severe injuries to both kne=
es
sidelined him gave Simms a chance to win the job.
Davis also said he is very pleased with the development of redshirt freshma=
n
QB Chance Mock.
""Chance Mock is really talented,"" Davis said. ""He has really good skills.""
Mock has outstanding speed for a quarterback and a strong arm. He also has =
a
very quick release.
""He needs to get some experience, but he has all the tools,"" Davis said.
So, looking at everything, how good can this Longhorn offense be?
""I think this group has a chance to be really good,"" he said. ""We have a lo=
t
of talented players. We just need to solidify the running game, and we're
working on that.""

UT Hires Volleyball Coach

Jerritt Elliott, 32, former interim head women's volleyball coach at the
University of Southern California, is the new head women's volleyball coach
at Texas.
He was the interim coach at USC for two years while former UT and current U=
SC
coach Mick Haley was coaching the U. S. Olympic Team.
Elliott replaces Jim Moore, who resigned.
A highly personable coach who is an outstanding recruiter, Elliott had the
top-rated recruiting classes in the nation both years he was at USC.
Last season, he led USC to its first final four appearance in 15 years and =
to
USC's first-ever share of the Pac-10 title.
USC also finished the year ranked No. 4 nationally by both the AVCA and
Volleyball Magazine.
USC compiled a 50-12 record under Elliott in these two years, going 29-3 la=
st
fall en route to the NCAA Final Four, and 21-9 in 1999.
In both years, Elliott was honored as the Pac-10 Conference Coach of the Ye=
ar
and was the 2000 Pacific Region Coach of the Year.
Elliott spent the last six years at USC (1995-2001), the last two years as
interim head coach and a four-year term prior to that as assistant coach.
Elliott accepted the interim head position in 1999 and 2000 in the absence =
of
Haley, who was serving as the USA National Team head coach through the  200=
0
Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
Elliott also was named the USA Junior National Team Head Coach for the summ=
er
of 2001, but will relinquish that role with USA Volleyball due to his
appointment at UT.
""It is with tremendous pleasure that I accept the University of Texas
volleyball  head coach position,"" he said. ""I am extremely enthusiastic abo=
ut
coming to Texas, which is considered one of the prominent volleyball progra=
ms
in the country.""","Leonard Davis DT Casey Hampton Davis Michael Vick Hampton Shaun Rogers Mack Brown John Mackovic Chris Simms Simms Bo Scaife Brock Edwards Austin Gerritt Simpson Ryan Brooks Greg Davis Hodges Mitchell Mitchell Robbie Doane Derrick Dockery Alfeo Randall Victor Ike Kenny Hayter Robin Ivan Williams Beltran Cedric Benson Mike Williams Mike Jason Glynn Matt Jason Glynn's Antwan Kirk-Hughes Tillman Holloway Mike Jones Davis

looking for detail to explain the substantial increase in insurance related 
cost allocations to ENA for 2001.  We have been given allocation projections 
that increase our expense from $3.9M to $8.0M.  I would like to know how this 
was determined and the nature of these costs (ie) what assets/positions.

If you are not the right person, I apologize for the intrusion and could you

442,"Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull.... in the 
company we would be a $100 stock.

On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the 
current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager 
promotion  for the typical associate including timeline.  This process 
mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.

I think radical change is not the answer.  The answer lies in a combination 
of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key 
points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible 
key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where 
necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the 
program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet 
commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.

The goals of any restructuring are:
 a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the 
business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the 
program;
 b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained;
 c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling 
and interviewing;
 d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly 
grounds the associate in the ""Enron technology"" which include skills in 
market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk;
 e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding 
talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them 
up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the 
program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues;
 f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, 
retention and performance tool;
 g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, 
non-traditional sources of talent and
 h) increase cost effectiveness.

The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, 
people and teams, business tracks, etc.

I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the 
key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the 
least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.

I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with 
a strawman.

Specifically, the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the 
reader (ie) what is your opinion?  Is this a good sale or can significant 
recovery (on a risk adjusted basis) occur if we convert the sub debt and 
infuse more equity?  Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given 
the possible recovery of this sector?  

The DASH is deficient in its view of Basic's prospects given current energy 
prices.

Jeff/Dick/Ray, what are your opinions?

to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring. 

Regards

456,"Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which 
does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this 
is a venture we should support.  In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in 
seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation 
company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 
2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.  These units are fully mobile via 
the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current 
SCR technology. They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency 
power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable.  
The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets 
that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and 
constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.  

The benefits include:
 a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the 
opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the 
possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power, 
Capstone and Elektryon;
 b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe 
that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize 
this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer 
applications;
 c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of 
critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.  If ENA through this 
venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in 
our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk;
 d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital 
would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology 
did not work or the market did not materialize;
 e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology;
 and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.

However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other 
Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company 
and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the 
technology proves out.  Given, that we could benefit most from the successful 
application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.

Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.  We have a 
very solid history with this company.  They have successfully solved many of 
the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently 
operating at New Albany.  They would bring the technical and engineering 
expertise at cost for their 50%.  ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause 
at a fixed number for their 50% .

If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I 
will set up a meeting.

contract is difficult.  However, I do like the behaviour that you get from 
such accountability (ie) high incentive to get done on time and on budget.  
My experience with NEPCO on cost plus has been very unfavourable (don't like 
#1).  I will be supportive of any structure that aligns our interests 
appropriately.  You might want to bounce a few ideas off Dan.  I have already 
given him a heads up on the value at stake if we can come in at the low end 
of the scale and early.

534,"State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails 
Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. 
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said. ",,,Questar Corp. Questar MMcf

SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

1. The discount rate shall apply to points utilized by the original shipper 
entering into 
the transportation agreement with Northwest. 

2. A shipper will be allowed to release and/or segment and release the 
capacity and 
shipper and replacement shipper may utilize any available points on 
Northwest's transmission system without impacting the discount for the 
original shipper.

3. This prearranged offer is for a reservation contract demand rate.? In 
addition to the 
Reservation Charge Bid, shipper will pay the volumetric charge, the 
applicable 
surcharges and fuel. 

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of 
transportation 
capacity for electronic bid (""package or packages""): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available 
transportation capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total available 
transportation capacity under the specified package OR multiple rates can be 
submitted each 
for a partial amount of available transportation capacity under the specified 
package.? If 
the same Shipper submits multiple bids, the highest present value for such 
package of 
available transportation capacity shall be considered the valid bid. All 
other bids from the 
same Shipper for the same package of transportation capacity will be 
discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is less than 
minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC 
Interest Rate x The 
Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the maximum rate is bid, the 
following formula 
is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days 
bid/100. In case 
of a tie, each tied shipper will have the right to improve its bid by 
submitting an improved 
bid within 24 hours of the bid close time.? Such improved bid shall be faxed 
to (801) 584-7076 to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie still 
exists, such capacity shall be awarded on a prorata basis.

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer 
than indicated 
for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.

566,"Frank - I'm forwarding the email I received from Enserco regarding the 
penalty for our failure to take the full volume on days 1 and 18 on deal 
#423705.  As I explained to Suzanne, I would not have paid this had they 
invoiced me for it but Enserco is a Netout customer and we were in a net 
receivable position this month so they deducted this amount out of what they 
paid me.  As the penalty seems to be legitimate, can I get you to set up a 
new deal in Sitara to offset the receivable?  If you agree with their 
calculations, can you set up a positive Demand charge of $2,405.03 with Enron 
as the Purchaser and Enserco as the Seller?

Please reply to this email with your approval (or disapproval) of their 
calculation and let me know when you have the demand charge set up (or not).

We do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters.  When MIPS receives an 
""incomplete"" from the parent meter it sends a -0- to POPS.  Yes, this is a 
big problem.  Our POPS team (Romeo D'Souza) has identified this problem and 
notified MIPS.  However, he was told this was not a priority item.   In the 
mean time we are overriding the volumes in POPS with the estimated volumes.

This particular meter was correct last night, the 14th rolled last night from 
MIPS and overrode the BAV with a -0- from day 14 forward.

This was corrected this morning and the meter re-allocated.

652," First, congratulations to all five of you and the others on your staffs who 
were involved for working together to get the excess line pack deal done 
today.  As I understand it, TK was able to sell 10,000 MMBtu at the Cal 
Border for something like $15 thanks to your efforts.  This thing went from 
Dave and Kent's idea to you guys' execution in about two days, even with a 
(slight) delay due to my panic attack on whether we can make downstream 
sales.   Great job!   Second, I think TK, Kevin, Maria and Glen and I have 
come up with a workable set of guidelines on when similar deals can be done 
in the future.  The key, as I expressed in the attached email, is that the 
sales be driven by a legitimate operational basis.  If Gas Control verifies 
that we have excess line pack at a location and that making the sale helps 
get line pack to optimal levels, such sales are appropriate.  Gas Control 
should also verify that the operational basis for the sale can be documented 
if the need ever arises.  Today's deal is a great example of that as we 
actually communicated to outside parties that we anticipated some pressure 
management issues.  If there are ever any questions about when such deals are 
appropriate, or about how to document the operational basis, please give me, 
Susan, or Maria a call.  Again, great job!  DF

consent agreement has been filed with the 
FTC and State of Texas Tennesse Pipeline as part of the normal review process 
prior to final approval for the PG&E Texas
assets formally owned by Valero and TECO.   Tennessee had a note in their 3rd 
quarter 10-Q on El Paso possibly putting 
some of the PG&E Texas acquired properties in their MLP.  They also indicated 
they had put their Crystal Storage in the MLP.

El Paso to Sell Oasis Pipe Stake

El Paso Energy Corp. will sell its 35% stake in Oasis Pipe Line, a 1 Bcf/d 
line in Texas, according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last 
week. El Paso said that the sale, which was negotiated in October, would 
result in a $20 million loss. 

The 36-inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the West Texas Waha 
market to the Katy hub outside of Houston. The pipeline provides a link 
between El Paso Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and is the principal 
route for Permian Basin supplies to access the Houston Ship Channel. 

Oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998, installing 9,400 horsepower of 
compression, and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets. 

Dow Hydrocarbons and Aquila Energy, a unit of Utilicorp United, also own 
stakes in the line. Along with its 35% ownership, Aquila also has firm 
transport rights on 280,000 Mcf/d. 

Before El Paso's sale is complete, it still needs approvals from the Federal 
Trade Commission and the Texas Attorney General.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

Re:  Texas Gas Rate Changes Effective 1/1/01

On November 30, 2000 Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP01-
135-000 pursuant to the Settlement Agreement in Docket No.
RP97-344, in which the Commission required Texas Gas to
reduce certain Account No. 858 contracts.  In the instant
filing Texas Gas proposes to reflect rate reductions
resulting from the termination of the HIOS T-17 contract.
Included in the filing were revised rates under Texas Gas'
Rate Schedule FT which Transco utilizes to render service to
its customers under its Rate Schedule FT-NT.  The revised
tariff sheets have a proposed effective date of January 1,
2001.  If accepted as proposed, the revised Texas Gas tariff
sheets would result in the following changes in Transco's
current Rate Schedule FT-NT Rates:


Zone SL Demand Charge -  $0.0192 decrease
Zone 1 Demand Charge  -  $0.0192 decrease

1) Inject into storage from CES IPP pool, which was long that day.
2) In ground storage transfer from Dayton's FSS storage to CES's FSS storage. 
Dayton has given Enron the approval to move this storage.

I told TCO the second option would be the most viable option, and it should 
not comprise TCO's position with its other shippers. 

As of right now, TCO has put all retro requests on hold. The bills will 
probably go out with these penalties on it. However, TCO will revisit the 
penalty issue, once the dust has settled. We are not the only shipper that 
incurred penalties, and TCO wants to treat everyone fairly. I did tell TCO to 
remember that Enron is not an affiliate, and TCO needs to treat Enron as TCO

734,"Ken,

Thanks for the opportunity to review the initial studies performed by the 
ERCOT
System Planning Technical Operations group and to have the opportunity to
comment on them at the January 31, 2001 CSC meeting.

After I began reviewing the reports that you sent out, I noticed the need for
the following items to be addressed quickly in order for all market 
participants
(including ERCOT) to perform meaningful transmission studies:

1)  A listing of single element contingencies that PSS/E and/or MUST performs
that aren't valid (phantom) contingencies from a physical perspective (i.e. 
the
protection schemes in place would not allow this issue to occur anyway).  The
easiest to explain example of this situation is when parallel step up
transformers are used at a power plant.  When one transformer is outaged by
automatic single element contingency functions of PSS/E or MUST, the remaining
transformer is reported to experience massive overloads that aren't really
relevant since the protection scheme in place wouldn't allow this to 
physically
occur.  While step up transformers of this nature can easily be screened from
the output of PSS/E and MUST, other phantom contingencies that are reported on
transmission line outages can't be.  This listing of phantom contingencies
should be developed and stored in such a fashion that allows it to be included
in PSS/E and/or MUST runs as an exception file of contingencies to be ignored.
A separate file should be maintained and posted on the ERCOT website for each 
of
the dataset A & B cases that are prepared annually.

2)  A listing by load flow bus number of all special contingencies that should
be included in PSS/E and/or MUST simulations to reflect the actual response of
protection schemes in place needs to be provided by the TPs.  A simple example
of a special contingency from a PSS/E and/or MUST stand point that is really a
single contingency from a physical system stand point is when an 
autotransformer
is connected to the line side of a breaker in a station, rather than to the
station bus.  PSS/E and MUST needs to be instructed to remove both components 
at
the same time in order to accurately simulate what is really a single
contingency from a physical perspective.  A separate file should be maintained
and posted on the ERCOT website for each of the dataset A & B cases that are
prepared annually.

3)  A listing by load flow bus number of all double circuit lines that are
greater than 0.5 miles in length needs to be provided by the TPs.  This 
listing
is needed by market participants to simulate ATC during severe weather
situations and for evaluating planned transmission additions using PSS/E 
and/or
MUST.  A separate file should be maintained and posted on the ERCOT website 
for
each of the dataset A & B cases that are prepared annually.

4)  A listing of valid operator actions that will be taken to alleviate post
contingency overloads should be provided by the TPs in a format that is
compatible with PSS/E and/or MUST.  A separate file should be maintained and
posted on the ERCOT website for each of the dataset A & B cases that are
prepared annually.


In addition, the following requested information would better allow all market
participants to understand the planned expansion and operation of the ERCOT
transmission system:

1)  Prepare an annual transmission plan document that is posted on the ERCOT
website which graphically and verbally illustrates the following aspects of
proposed projects: location, electrical connectivity (i.e. one-line
representation), estimated cost, anticipated system benefits, and proposed
in-service date.  The projects proposed and described in this expansion plan
document should be of the same scope and timing as the ones modeled in the 
SSTF
dataset A & B cases.  Ideally, this document would be posted annually on the
website at the same time as the dataset A & B cases.  The California ISO
currently provides this information on their website at the following address:
http://www.caiso.com/thegrid/planning/transassessments/.

2)  Prepare an annual document that will be posted on the ERCOT website, which
explains how the commercially significant constraints (CSCs) will be handled
(i.e. preventative generation redispatch or post contingency operator action 
to
reconfigure the transmission system through opening or closing breakers).


To the degree that is possible, please include these issues in your agenda for
discussion at the January 31, 2001 CSC meeting.  Thanks

I am afraid I have not made that much progress on my assignment.  I talked to 
ML Ruffer about the $1.2M basis swap.  She does not specifically know about 
the deal, but does know she gave between $1M and $2M to the West desk out of 
a reserve behind the scenes.  I don't know for sure, but this has to be how 
the $ got in the West P&L.  It is booked on 11/12/99 which is between 
EC3952.P (the annuity getting the unamortized $27M into the West desk) and 
EC3952.S (the annuity getting the $5M from Corp into the West desk).  I 
hadn't paid attention until just now, but Suzette Emmons booked the deal.  
She ran the transport book at that time.  

The physical buys from Canada (EC2208.11, EC3952.15, and EC3952.11) are 
booked correctly in Sitara.  EC3952.11 was changed by Kathy Reeves from 
ending in '08 to ending in '01 on 4/4/00.  However, the end date remains '08 
in Sitara.  I don't know why the term was changed.

I have meetings almost all day.  I will still try and investigate, but I know 
you were looking for some answers today.  You may want to try and get in 
touch with Suzette and see if she remembers the basis swaps.

What do I do if I've already taken the class?
If you've already attended a session in the past while employed with Enron, 
you do not have to attend these sessions.  A ""Refresher Course"" will be

How do those of us attend the Harassment Avoidance if I do not work in 
Houston?
We are making the Harassment Avoidance sessions available on Video to be 
forwarded to your HR manager.   You are NOT encouraged to make travel 
arrangements to attend the Houston sessions.

Who pays the $50?

770,"Hi Mark,

David got home tonight and told me the fun you guys had in Seattle.? The snow 
shoe hike sounded like a good work out and fun too, but I'm sure I wouldn't 
have made it as smoothly as the rest of you.? I'm so fucking fat and I'm 
determined to get back in the shape that I should be and the way I was most 
of my life!? I've got to start working out on a consistent basis.? David said 
that if I don't the family is going to have a FAT intervention on me!!!

By the way, a note about Cita.? I can't even begin to tell you how much she 
loves you and since Bill left us she's even looking at you as a spiritual 
replacement of him.? Now I'm not saying that she doesn't love Angela as much, 
but Cita has a bond with the boys in our family (Kevin, Donald, Steve) in a 
totally different way as she does with the girls!!? I can't explain why (I've 
got my theories) but she just does.? 

Anyway, I was visiting her on Monday and she was really distraught about the 
last conversation she had with you over the phone while you were at Jorge's 
house.? She said that she felt that you misunderstood what she meant when she 
said that Bill was stupid.? I'm sure you know what she meant by it as far as 
him not wanting to change his life style (drinking & smoking), but she felt 
that you got mad at her for calling him stupid.? Her biggest consern is that 
she feels for that reason you probably won't want to talk to her again or 
much at all!!? I did tell her that you are a dick but that you're not that 
big of a dick!!? Regardless, we all know that you're a?prick anyway, but 
could you please give her a call sometime soon just to put her mind at ease?? 
You don't have to mention the ""stupid"" word or conversation, just call her to 
say hi and that you miss her more than she misses you!? Don't tell her that I 
emailed you about! my conversation with her.? Otherwise she'll just say ""what 
the fuck is an email?""

Looking forward to seeing you later this month.(the 23rd)? Also, I want you 
to know that you're really not a prick, your a dickhead!

As always - with way more love than you deserve,? Uncle (fat) Bobby!!!

776," A dad walks into a market followed by his ten-year-old son. The kid is
spinning a 25 cent piece in the air and catching it between his teeth. As
they walk through the market someone bumps into the boy at just the wrong
moment and the coin goes straight into his mouth and lodges in his throat.

panicking, shouting for help.

coffee.   At the sound of the commotion, he looks up, puts his coffee cup
down on the saucer, neatly folds his newspaper and places it on the counter.
Then he gets up from his seat and makes his unhurried way across the market.

> Reaching the boy, the man carefully takes hold of the boy's testicles and
squeezes gently but firmly. After a few seconds the boy convulses
violently and coughs up the 25 cent piece, which the man catches in his free
hand.

walks back to his seat in the coffee bar without saying a word.

As you are all well aware, we must be flat in enpower and caps position 
manager at the beginning and end of each shift.  This is extremely important 
for ourselves and other groups on the floor.
Since Friday, we have been flat in position manager only 2 out of 5 times at 
8 in the morning the following day.  On Monday, Risk could not run its 
reports until AFTER noon.  On Tuesday, we delayed the entire floor again.  
And on Thursday, Risk ran its reports based on information from RT that we 
were flat for the 13th.  We were not flat and I did not know of the problem 
until preschedulers brought it to the floors attention.  This is not good.

Over the past week we have experienced numerous complex cuts and many members 
of the group have put in long hours and worked diligently to try to balance 
these cuts out.  I recognize and appreciate this hard work.  However, at the 
end of the day we must be flat.  If you have questions, it is your 
responsibility to ask.  I do not want to call group members back in after 
their shift is over if we are not flat, but I will have little other choice 
if this continues.

Portland generation, their share at Colstrip.  In our system it is shown as 
Montana System border.

There are three deals associated with this length,  1 mw is on deal # 479285 
and 479286, and was our daily buy from PGE.

The last deal number is 268656, and is our longer term deal.

The reason for the length is the  ramp-down of Smurfit deal # 246859, due to

779,"Thank you to all who participated in our benefit auction at the holiday party 
last weekend.  Donations, auction funds and the Enron match will result in 
$12,000 for two local charities!

This year we are directing our fund-raising efforts to two worthwhile 
community resources:  Portland's Court Appointed Special Advocates program 
(CASA) and the Raphael House shelter for battered women and their children.  
CASA is a non-profit organization that places community volunteers with 
foster children and at-risk youth to ensure their fair treatment in the 
courts.  Raphael House provides a refuge for women and children oppressed by 
domestic violence.

Please make your check payable to CASA or Raphael House, you may evenly 
distribute your donation with a check to each or the total to your preferred 
charity.  For tax purposes, all checks will be sent in by year end.  If you 
were not lucky enough to win a bidding war we will still accept your money 
and remember Enron will match all donations!  All checks should be turned in 
by 12/20/00, I will be out of the office until 12/14/00.  However, if you 
prefer to turn your check in right away, please see Jessica Burry.  We will 
ensure that you receive a receipt from the appropriate charity.

he did an awesome job!

834,"We have made changes in the holiday pay compensation policy in an attempt to 
clarify this issue for those affected.   I am confident that you will be 
agreeable with the decision that has been approved by Tim, Jeff , Amy & 
myself.

The payment will be made in the form of a lump sum that is payable in 
addition to your normal compensation:

Major Holidays worked:    $500
Minor Holidays worked:     $250


The classification of the remaining holidays will be as follows:

Thanksgiving day - major 
Day after - minor
CHRISTMAS PARTY - major
Christmas Eve - minor 
Christmas Day - major
New Years Eve - major
New years Day - minor



If a shift touches a major holiday,  ie the night shift of Christmas eve 
spills into Xmas ,  you will be paid for a major holiday.
The only exception to the above rule is the 6pm to 6am shift on New Year's 
Day.   This is not considered a holiday.


We think this is a more straightforward plan that provides more incentive to 
those working the  holidays.


This is a policy that is new and subject to  change at any time.    If you 
have questions about the policy, please contact myself or Amy Fitzpatrick.

Thanks and have a great holiday season.

Can you look at deal # 460097, sale of 45 or 50 (??) MW to Texas-New Mexico 
on 11/16/00 at HE7 for $125.00. 
EnPower, the El Paso Model, and Unit Status all say that this deal was at 50 
MWh's, HOWEVER, you have put a note in the El Paso Model that states that El 
Paso is claiming that it's only 45 MW (no other comments).  I have a dispute 
here from El Paso who, on the back end, is saying that the deal was only for 
45MWs.  I'm assuming that the deal was actually 50MWs and that's why you left 
our systems at 50MW and just made a note.  Please advise me on what I need to 
tell Houston Settlements so we can get paid on this.

What do I do if I've already taken the class?
If you've already attended a session in the past while employed with Enron, 
you do not have to attend these sessions.  A ""Refresher Course"" will be 
offered at no cost.  

How do those of us attend the Harassment Avoidance if I do not work in 
Houston?
We are making the Harassment Avoidance sessions available on Video to be 
forwarded to your HR manager.   You are NOT encouraged to make travel 
arrangements to attend the Houston sessions.

Who pays the $50?
The $50 fee will be billed to your cost center. Individuals are not expected 
to pay.

Are there any additional dates than those listed on previous email?
Due to the number of people who have not attended in the past, we are making 
special arrangements to offer more classes in the next few months.

not enrolled.

bottom of my in-box, just like so many other things. As far as the Blazer 
ticket trade, I believe I bought a call from you on the Laker game, and you 
bought the option from me on the Cavaliers - so I can choose to exercise on 
12/13 at 7 p.m., and you can choose to exercise on 1/16 at 7 p.m. In other 
words, no matter what happens, I'm going to both games. Got it?

As far as good stories from that night, I probably have the best, or at least 
one of the more hilarious, of those circulating the floor. And no, it has 
nothing to do with me. Ask me about it later, and I might be able to give it

Just a quick question while I remember, as you know I am giving an overview of the DASH process and the Legal Risk Memo that must accompany any DASH.
My understanding is that the Legal Risk Memo must be attached to the DASH when the DASH is circulated and that on the face of the DASH form prepared by RAC, we should not be and there should not appear any Legal Risk assessment, which must only be contained in the Legal Risk Memo. The DASH should simply refer to ""See attached Legal Risk Memo"".
	
I am hoping that this is also how you like to see the process work in practice.

In addition I am going to say that if possible you need to be briefed and receive a draft of the Legal Risk Memo before it is circulated with the DASH.

When Is A Software Invention Actually Ready For Patenting? 

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently affirmed a District Court decision of patent invalidity under the on-sale provisions of 35 U.S.C. ?102(b). Robotic Vision Sys., Inc. v. View Eng'g, Inc and General Scanning, Inc., 249 F.3d 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Federal Circuit applied the new two prong on-sale bar test from Wayne K. Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc., 525 U.S. 55 (1998). 

In the Pfaff case, the Supreme Court, referred to drawings and other descriptions of an invention as proof that the invention is complete and hence ready for patenting. Using the new Pfaff test, the Federal Circuit held in the Robotic Vision case that a software invention was ready for patenting when one of the inventors verbally described the invention to a co-worker in sufficient detail to allow him to practice it, even though the actual software used to practice the invention did not exist before the on-sale bar date. 

The Robotic Vision case helps illustrate the dynamic nature of patent law used to protect high-tech inventions. It also illustrates the caution that must be exercised when attempting to protect high-tech inventions including methods that are implemented with software. The conduct of inventors as well as marketing or sales materials that could describe details of software inventions must now receive more scrutiny to avoid inadvertent on-sale bars under ?102(b).

yesterday.  I will not be attending.  

In addition, here's a version of a paper Craig Gannett is working on 
recommending changes to help solve the energy crisis for the NW.  Craig has 
been working on this with Cynthia Sanderr and I believe has circulated this 
paper in draft form to some degree on the Hill.  I have not given Craig any

should not make findings, it should simply refer the information it gets to 
FERC about abuse of market power and violations of antitrust and if should 
report that information subject to confidentiality.  Also, if contrary to our 
wishes, the FERC allows market monitoring committees to further investigate, 
make findings, and impose penalties, FERC must require the tariffs to contain 
detailed due process requirements that: (1) specifically name the behavior 
that is illegal and relate any penalties to specific violations, (2) require 
the MMC to notify the party being invested of the tariff or law that may have 
been violated, (3) allow the party being investigated to perform discovery on 
any other party (including the ISO or the PX) that may instead be at fault or 
may be a contributing party, (4) to facilitate this discovery, allow a party 
to know the identity of the party (if any) that alerted the MMC to the 
alleged violation, and (5) detail the process for any discovery, hearing, or 
ADR process to ensure the party being investigated has adequate notice and 
opportunity to be heard and to impute others who may instead be at fault.

locate some mobile generators that Enron has available. There are several 
Public Power utilities (BPA customers)  in the Region that are interested in 
having these units located in their service areas. My understanding is that 
BPA is requiring small generators to go through an interconnect process if 
they want to sell the power on the market. But, if the utility owns the 
generation, or if the utilities industrial customer owns it, and they are 
displacing BPA power then they don't have to go through this interconnection 
process.  That seems to me like self-dealing in that BPA's Power Business 
Line gets the benefit of this load that the Transmission Business Line is 
allowing to slip in, but other marketers, such as Enron, has to play by 
different rules if we want to have access to this power.

I have a meeting Thursday with one of BPA's VP's in  theTransmission Business

Thursday night=20
?

From CNN.com:
April 5, 2001
Web posted at: 4:38 p.m. EDT (2038 GMT)
Hena Cuevas is a CNN Correspondent based out of California.
Q: What do we expect to be the main points of Governor Gray Davis' address=
=20
this evening?
CUEVAS: His office has said that the basic theme will be conservation.=20
Basically, he is trying to motivate everyone to conserve. Also, we are=20
expected to hear a stern warning involving the power situation this summer.=
=20
It is expected to be a warmer than average summer. Davis e is also going to=
=20
address that. We have also been told that he will make some sort of=20
announcement and that the announcement is being kept under tight wraps; it =
is=20
top secret. At this point we can=01,t even speculate as to what it will be.=
 But=20
there will be a big announcement.
It is expected he will be speaking for about four minutes and that he will=
=20
start at about 6:05 p.m. PDT.




Q: How has the energy crisis affected the Governor's popularity?
CUEVAS: The latest polls -- and these were probably around Mid-March =01) s=
how=20
that his popularity and his approval ratings have declined. The latest poll=
=20
commissioned by the Service Employees International Union shows that only 2=
9=20
percent of those surveyed said that they would vote for Davis again. He,=20
however, is trying to distance himself from this energy problem saying that=
=20
it is the responsibility of the Republican lead Senate and Legislature who=
=20
were the ones that passed these deregulation laws and that basically, he ju=
st=20
got handed the problem and he is trying to solve it.=20
There was the first ever state Democratic convention in Orange County last=
=20
weekend =01) Orange County has traditionally been highly Republican. Everyb=
ody=20
there said that they supported Governor Davis and that they believe that th=
e=20
Democratic Party in this state will not be affected by this crisis, that th=
ey=20
are basically trying to fix what the previous administration did.
Q: What impact will the California energy crisis have on Davis=01, politica=
l=20
future?
CUEVAS: Davis says that it will not impact his future. He feels very=20
confident that he has been able to send out the message that he is not=20
responsible for this crisis and that he is doing everything in his power to=
=20
fix it. One of the things that he mentioned in a press conference on Saturd=
ay=20
is that there are already new electrical plants that are under construction=
=20
that should be ready by either 2004 or 2005. He says that he is doing=20
everything in his power to be able to solve this crisis. Again, as things=
=20
worsen and as the rolling blackouts begin and continue over the summer,=20
obviously, everybody is trying to find somebody to blame and he is in the=
=20
perfect position. That is why a lot of fingers are being pointed toward him=
.
Q: What actions has the Governor taken so far to try to avert the energy=20
crisis?
CUEVAS: One of the things that he has approved is the construction of new=
=20
energy plants. Also, he is asking that private companies and other large=20
power users be allowed to contract directly for power with generators. This=
=20
is different than what the Public Utilities Commission had been arguing for=
.=20
He has also put forth called the 20/20 plan that says that if you save 20=
=20
percent on your consumption of energy as compared to last summer, you will=
=20
get 20 percent off your energy bill for the four summer months. He is doing=
=20
everything in his power, he says, to try and avoid an even higher rate=20
increase. However, there are a lot of people who are arguing for a higher=
=20
rate and saying that would be the only way to try and stop this crisis.
Q: Do you have any final thoughts to share?
CUEVAS: When you go down to the consumers themselves, everyone is trying to=
=20
make sure that the average resident is not the one footing the bill for the=
=20
problems that are taking place at the governmental level. There seems to be=
 a=20

one of the biggest concerns. Right now California ranks number 48 or 49 in=

FPL Group, Entergy Merger May Be in Trouble

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

FPL Group Inc. (NYSE: FPL) and Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR), whose proposed=20
merger would create the largest power distribution company in the United=20
States (6.3 million customers), said their deal has hit some significant=20
snags. In a joint statement, Juno Beach, Fla.-based FPL Group and=20
Louisiana-based Entergy said ""certain issues have arisen in connection with=
=20
their pending merger, including governance structure/value-related issues a=
nd=20
integration of the two companies going forward."" The companies said they wi=
ll=20
be meeting in the near future to address the issues, but did not elaborate.=
=20
They added that they would have no further comment on the status of the=20
merger at the present time.=20

Analysis: FPL Group and Entergy join what appears to be a growing list of=
=20
companies experiencing problems with pending mergers. Just within the last=
=20
month, Con Edison and Northeast Utilities announced significant problems=20
related to their proposed partnership that most likely will find resolution=
=20
only in a courtroom. Following that, we heard about problems surrounding=20
Sierra Pacific Resources' ability to finance its pending purchase of Portla=
nd=20
General from Enron. However, the fact that the ""merger of equals"" between F=
PL=20
Group and Entergy may not proceed is big news as it represents the largest=
=20
partnership among energy companies that the U.S. energy industry has ever=
=20
witnessed.=20

First, let me provide some background. FPL Group and Entergy Corp. announce=
d=20
their merger in July 2000. The $27 billion partnership reportedly will crea=
te=20
the largest power company in the nation, eclipsing the now-completed merger=
=20
between PECO and Commonwealth Edison that created Exelon Corp. The new=20
company, which will be named at a later date, will own and operate generati=
ng=20
capacity of more than 48,000 megawatts, and as noted will serve more than 6=
.3=20
million customers. Although this is referred to as a ""merger of equals,"" FP=
L=20
is purchasing Entergy. FPL Group shareholders will own 57 percent of the=20
common equity of the combined company, and Entergy shareholders will own 43=
=20
percent.  The benefits of this merger are too many to name here, but some=
=20
advantages=01*beyond the staggering earnings potential=01*certainly stand o=
ut. =20

First, the combined company will be a leader in wholesale generation and on=
e=20
of the nation's largest independent power producers with nearly 10,000=20
megawatts of unregulated generating capacity. Related to this is Entergy's=
=20
announced joint venture with Koch Industries, under which Entergy gains=20
10,000 miles of natural-gas pipeline assets and becomes a world leader in=
=20
weather derivatives. Second, the two companies come together with an=20
important affinity in their competitive approaches. Both have divested thei=
r=20
non-core businesses, and are focused on expanding utility operations and=20
generation businesses. Along these lines, both companies support=20
emission-free energy, with Entergy being particularly strong in nuclear and=
=20
FPL Group being strong in renewable energies (particularly wind). Third, th=
e=20
regulated business of Florida Power & Light=01*FPL Group's subsidiary=01*is=
 in a=20
strong growth mode. Today, the utility serves 600,000 more customers than i=
t=20
did in 1990. In 1999 alone, FPL added nearly 76,000 new accounts=01*a 2-per=
cent=20
increase over 1998. Fourth, FPL Group is the stronger of the two with regar=
d=20
to telecom, and the company's subsidiary FPL FiberNet will gain considerabl=
y=20
from new opportunities available in Entergy's service territory. Overall, t=
he=20
combined forces of Entergy and FPL Group create a multi-diversified company=
,=20
potentially strong not only in the distribution side of the business, but=
=20
wholesale generation as well as trading, telecom and renewable energy.=20

The pending merger between the two companies had already experienced some=
=20
previous setbacks related to its timetable for completion. In January, an=
=20
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a procedural schedule that called for=
=20
hearings related to the merger to begin in October 2001, which was expected=
=20
to delay the merger closing by three to six months. Entergy filed a motion=
=20
for reconsideration of the schedule. In mid-February, a new ALJ ruling move=
d=20
up to July the Louisiana Public Service Commission's scheduled hearings on=
=20
the merger, returning the regulatory proceedings to their original 15-month=
=20
timetable. Consequently, prior to this latest announcement of new problems=
=20
associated with the merger, the partnership between FPL Group and Entergy w=
as=20
scheduled to close by the end of this year. =20

With that overview, we can speculate on the reasons why the proposed merger=
=20
is hitting some snags. Keep in mind that FPL is the buying partner in the=
=20
merger and more than likely would be the company to contest certain element=
s=20
of the deal that may have been altered since the merger was first announced=
.=20
From the start, it was understood that the new headquarters would be locate=
d=20
in Florida and that FPL Group would gain majority ownership of the new=20
company. In the announcement of ""issues"" related to the merger, the two=20
companies identified ""integration of the two companies going forward"" as on=
e=20
of the factors. This could be an indication that one of the companies is=20
seeking to modify previously agreed-upon terms of the merger contract. =20

In addition, the companies made reference to ""governance structure /=20
value-related issues and integration of the two companies."" This, of course=
,=20
could mean many different things. However, one major issue that may be=20
impacting the merger was revealed in a recent report which suggested that=
=20
Entergy Wholesale Operations (the non-utility power development, marketing=
=20
and trading subsidiary of Entergy) is considering the divestiture of its tw=
o=20
U.K. generating assets, Damhead Creek and Saltend. According to Power Finan=
ce=20
& Risk, power traders familiar with inside knowledge have reported that the=
=20
Entergy subsidiary is considering the sale of the units, which could earn u=
p=20
to $2 billion in the secondary market. Both units are combined-cycle gas=20
turbines and together represent about 2,000 MW. Damhead Creek generates abo=
ut=20
800 MW and is located in Kent, England; Saltend generates about 1,200 MW an=
d=20
is located in Yorkshire.=20

According to the report, Entergy has declined to comment on the matter.=20
However, rival traders say the possible divestiture may reflect the tough=
=20
economics of operating gas-fired plants in the United Kingdom, and Entergy'=
s=20
preference for more lucrative markets in Southern and Eastern Europe. As=20
noted, one of the main appeals of the pending merger between FPL Group and=
=20
Entergy is that it will create a company that is a leader in wholesale with=
=20
nearly 10,000 megawatts of unregulated generating capacity. At least that w=
as=20
the blueprint at the time the two companies entered into their agreement. A=
ny=20
plans to divest assets, on either side of the negotiating table, clearly=20
changes the deal and may in fact be one of the ""value-related issues"" that=
=20
has complicated this deal. Many mergers of equals also include ""pooling of=
=20
interest"" clauses restricting either party from altering its value (up or=
=20
down) by a specified percentage. Certainly, the divestiture of assets could=
=20
have an impact on the value of Entergy's portfolio.=20

The announcement of potential problems associated with the merger was not=
=20
made until early this morning, so it is too early to assess any impact that=
=20
the announcement might have on the companies' stocks.  On March 16, FPL=20
shares closed at $64.25 while Entergy finished at $37.50. As of mid-morning=
=20
on March 19, FPL shares had fallen to $60.63 and Entergy shares had dropped=
=20
to about $36.35. Both companies are considered ""stocks to watch"" today as=
=20
further impact from the problems associated with the merger may become more=
=20
apparent.=20

Although Enron is not part of either the DSTAR Power Marketer Coalition
or the RTOWest Power Marketer Coaltion, I am passing this on to you so
you will know what I would be advocating in RTOWest.  If you see
something problematic (which I doubt, since the DSTAR market monitoring
approach is pretty much a minimalist approach), let me know, so we can
sort out any possible differences privately.

Thanks,

Carl

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

list be delayed until after that effort is satisfactory.  I am receiving 
tough calls and I am keeping the wolves at bay, but I can not tell you how 
bad it will be if we are forced into giving out a bunch of plastic responses 
on Monday.   I have also been contacted by Andy at Moody's and so far I have 
him calm....but as we all know he is an explosion waiting to happen.   I am 
deeply concerned over this matter.

1011,"The market received the announcement of Larry's retirement and Bill's 
succession very calmly.   I talked to each of our analysts and elaborated a 
bit on the news and answered their questions:
 - Why is Larry leaving?  Was there any ""hidden"" reason? 
 -  What is Bill's background?
 - Does this signal any change in strategy or direction from Enron?
 - Do we anticipate any other change in the business as a result of this 
management change?

Several said that ""since this seems to not be a big change (in direction or 
strategy), I'm not going to write anything on it"".


The unit price did not reflect much change.   The units opened Monday (the 
day of the news) at $29, blipped up some 3/16  just after the press release, 
and then settled back to the opening price.   Tuesday opened strong, trended 
up $.50 in heavy volume and then again settled to $29.   Wednesday's price 
closed up 1/16, at $29.0625.

Daily volumes were:  Monday 27,400 units
            Tuesday 50,200 units
                 Wednesday 20,800 units

We were hoping to communicate that this would be a fairly seamless transition

It would be appreciated if you would follow-up with an e-mail to me giving me 
your thoughts on Lawrence.  Specifically, answers to the following questions 
would be helpful:

Does the candidate possess the required technical skills to be successful in 
this job?     No question in my mind.
Does the candidate possess the necessary leadership and teamwork skills and 
behaviors?    Appears to have the necessary skills and behaviors, got along 
great and would argue that he is probably a step up from Nick Bednorz.
Does the candidate possess the necessary communication skills (internal & 
external)?     Extremely good discussion on some technical accounting issues 
convinced me he could articulate succinctly rather complex accounting in 
simpler terms.    Believable and gave me a feeling he could be trusted. 
Does the candidate seem in alignment with Enron's values?     Saw nothing 
that would indicate otherwise.
In your opinion, do you believe the candidate would be successful in this 
job?     Better bet than most, I would say.

Any other feedback would be most appreciated!   Found him to be warm and 
friendly and easy to talk to.    Although hard to judge it appears from our 
discussion that he has had jobs that have forced him to complement his boss' 
style and is comfortable in that role.

It can buy a House...............But not a Home 

It can buy a Bed..................But not Sleep 

It can buy a Clock................But not Time 

It can buy you a Book..........But not knowledge 

It can buy you a Position......But not Respect 

It can buy you Medicine.......But not Health 

It can buy you Blood............But not Life 

It can buy you Sex..............But not Love 

So you see money isn't everything. 

And it often causes pain and suffering. 

I tell you all this because........... 

I am your Friend, and as your Friend I want to take away your pain
and  suffering.............. 

So send me all your money.......... 

And I will suffer for you. 

CASH ONLY PLEASE 

Thought this was gonna be one of those ""inspirational"" ones, didn't 
you????

1064,"Keith,
Ron's note pretty well summed it up.  Sorry my earlier correspondence didn't speak clearly enough to these issues.  This is a new electric generation plant.  It doesn't necessarily fall into any existing utility service area, as far as I know.  If anything, it might fall into the City of Famrmington's muni gas service.  However, if the City of Farmington is funding the plant (including  the cost of the interconnect) through muni bonds, it's doubtful they'll have any problem with the source of supply.

I'm interested in the theory that would necessitate our receiving prior permission to interconnect with a direct end-use customer in any area, uncontested or otherwise.  They'll be building the lateral line (or we'll build it, but they own it).  All we're really doing here is the delivery point.  I understood this situation fits within the FERC's new guidelines for construction of such facilities, and would not require a prior notice filing.

Let me know what additional information you might need.

1065,"We have received a partial plot of the subject property which confirms the aforementioned gas pipelines (2-34"" PG&E lines, 1-30"" EPNG line and 1-42"" Mojave line).  There is no indication of a SoCal line on the plot.  The owners of the property stated that no SoCal line, other than a small 3"" gas sales line, was located on their property.  They did not know where SoCal was located.  Can we get a SoCal map of the area?  It appears that the small gas sales line runs toward the city of Mojave, perhaps connecting to other sales lines.

1066,"Team,
These are some points for discussion on the conference call next week.
In todays market, I think we all can agree that the profitability is there,
the only hurdle might be environmental or the potential for two phase flow.
If we could start with these points for discussion, and come to some
resolve on these issues, we can move to the logistics of the project.

   Results of the modeling conducted on the pipeline identifying the
   potential two phase flow. ( Ken Chow)
   Potential environmental concerns. (Emissions, Possible accumulation of
   liquid, Disposal of potential liquid).
        ( Larry Campbell )

Sense this project will be taking advantage of peaks in the market, the
most logical answer is to make this equipment portable. If we plan on long
term benefits at the California border, this could be a permit installation
with a pipeline hookup from a new rail facility in Needles. But, other
areas might be identified like inlets to power plants that justify portable
equipment with NGL supplied by truck. Supplying the butane by truck from
rail facility's like the one in Mohave, might also be a way to get the
project in Needles on-line sooner. Just some topic's for discussion.

   Natural Gas and NGL Pricing projections. ( Kevin Hyatt )
   Alternate points to inject the butane. ( Norm Spalding, Earl Chanley )
   Rail car leasing and availability. ( Randy Lagrimini, Larry Garrett )
   Rail carriers in the area, cost of transportation. ( Randy Lagrimini,

1067,"Kevin, as we discussed last Wednesday, following is a listing of the
issues addressed during our conversation concerning the Proposed
Transaction Between Panda and Transwestern.  I have also included some
additional questions which I thought of later.  Although I think I have
covered most of the issues, I am certain there will be more as we
continue our discussions.  As I currently understand, we are going to
try and continue our conversation on Wednesday.  Hopefully you will have
time to complete your hydraulic study and answer these questions/issues
by that time.  If you have questions concerning the following, please
feel free to contact me at (972) 361-1332 and I will try to help
clarify.

Maximum Hourly Quantity - Panda will require the minimum capability to
burn the Maximum Daily Quantity in a 16 hour period with the potential
flexibility to burn the plants complete hourly capability over a shorter
time frame.  Your voice message to Jim on Thursday, regarding a scaled
burn window based on notification timing, should address this issue. 
Although there may be instances where the actual burn will be over 24
hours, the assumption should be that under even the shortest
notification timing, 16 hours would be needed.  Something to consider
would be how to incorporate this schedule into the contract. 
Consideration would also need to be given in how this, and in general
the operations and requirements of a power plant, would potentially
deviate from the standard GISB nomination cycles and corresponding gas
flows and how to incorporate that into the contract.

Contract Rate - Although approximately $0.45/MMBtu has already been
mentioned, it should suffice to say that the lowest possible cost of our
gas supply, transportation and storage services is the goal.  There are,
however, a couple of points that could use some clarification.  First,
would the rates in the proposal be maximum rates as defined by a tariff
filing or would these be negotiated?  The current assumption is that
they are negotiated because of the increase for years 6 through 10 and
the escalator for the remaining 20 years.  The preference would be for
negotiated rates in order to eliminate any rate risk the project would
hold if they were tariff based.  If they are negotiated, a better
understanding of how the rate is broken into its various components
would be helpful.  If they are tariff based, a better understanding of
the anticipated increase and the escalator would be needed.

Fuel Rate - A better understanding of the reasoning and numbers behind
this rate would be beneficial.  Also, how does Transwestern track and
adjust for actual fuel percentages?

Delivery Term - A shorter term would be required, somewhere in the 10
to 20 year range.

Services - Although 500 psi may not be quite enough pressure at the
facility, the hydraulic study should give a better indication of the
actual pressures at the plant and should be discussed further after the
study is complete.  It should be noted that Transwestern's interconnect
with the facility could still be some distance from the plant,
therefore, increasing the pressure requirement at the interconnection
point to be greater than the plant's requirements.

Other Questions - What is the planned capacity of the lateral from
Copper Eagle to the TW/EPNG interconnect?  Would alternative receipt and
delivery combinations be charged based on the tariff commodity and fuel
for the particular path?  Since there is already alternate receipt and
delivery point capabilities, is the 50,000 MMBtu/day backhaul a
guarantee?  Although storage is planned at Copper Eagle, how can
Transwestern help manage daily imbalances and short notice start up and
shut downs in order to minimize penalty exposure?

Thanks for your help in trying to address these issues.  I look forward
to talking with you on Wednesday if not sooner.

 ",,,FYI
1069,"Ron,

Thanks for the note.  Several comments/questions-

It is not necessary to plan facilities for 750 MMcf/d and 1000 MMcf/d to meet the 16-hour day load.  At the moment, we can only identify 540 MMcf/d potential demand for 16-hour day load.   
Can we avoid a fully looped line and still serve the 540 MMcf/d demand for 16-hour day load?  
If so, would there be additional capacity that we could sell to other markets based on 24-hour loads in the Phoenix area?

I'll be out of town on Tues + Wed, returning on Thurs.  Let's get together and agree the base case for project scope.  I'll ask Susan Wadle to co-ordinate a meeting with you, Kevin, Ben, and myself.

I apologize for the tone of my e-mail, but hope you agree that from your e-mail, it could be interpreted that at the last minute, I was asking for a new,comprehensive cost estimate- i.e. Level B for the entire project. This is, and always was our mission to provide a full and complete cost estimate for the project.
I really don't need a lesson in how to deal with contractors, and fully realize they will do whatever is asked of them, since they are being paid on a time basis.
The task of getting ENSR to do a complete cost estimate of all environmental work related to the execution of the project is a vital and important component of the total project cost estimate. Whether the project proceeds or not is highly dependent on the economics of the project, and therfore, getting ENSR to define the work and estimate the associated costs cannot be considered as a wasted task that has no value. We do need an estimate of the all encompassing budget, and then as a complete analysis is done, decide whether to proceed with any or all parts of the defined scope.
I look forward to  putting this misunderstanding behind us and work together in a co-ordinated effort to complete the task at hand (getting as good a cost estimate as we can) and see if this project is economically feasible

Thank You.

1077,"El Paso Receives Requests for 9.7 Bcf/d of Capacity 
El Paso Natural Gas reported yesterday that it received 127 shipper requests for a total of 9.7 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity in its recent open season. A total of 76 responses were received requesting 4.5 Bcf/d for deliveries to the border or inside the State of California and a total of 51 responses were received requesting a volume of 5.2 Bcf/d for deliveries to states east of California. 
Perhaps understating the significance of the response, El Paso Natural Gas President Patricia Shelton said the company was ""pleased."" 
""We are willing to expand our system if this strong showing of support from the marketplace results in sufficient binding commitments,"" she added. 
During open seasons, shippers typically request far more capacity than they're willing to pay for, but the tremendous response does indicate the need for a substantial expansion. This open season allowed parties to express ""non-binding"" interest in transportation service. It also allowed current shippers to express their non-binding interest in relinquishing some or all of their existing capacity that might be used to serve proposed new loads. However, no current shipper indicated a desire to relinquish any of its existing capacity, El Paso said. 
The pipeline now will begin negotiating binding agreements with the responding parties and identifying appropriate facilities to possibly expand its system. Upon execution of firm transportation service agreements, the company will finalize the optimum facility design and then file a project with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Shippers with questions should contact Jerry W. Strange, director of transportation marketing at (915) 496-3139.

We have a customer - True Oil Company - that would like us to gather and buy 
their gas in the Powder River.
They do not want a gathering agreement. They only want a purchase agreement. 
They are willing to commit that the reserves will flow through Enron's 
facilities but do not want to sign a gathering agreement.
We do not want to purchase their gas for an agreed to rate for more than one 
year.
We want the reopener in the purchase agreement.
Their idea is that we would purchase the gas at CIG index minus $0._____ and 
if Enron is not purchasing the gas that a third party will have to 
pay/negotiate with Enron for the gathering.

The minus would include all gathering - field and Ft Union, fuel, shrink,

 4. The changes that you made in 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.2.1 are okay.  The 
change that was made to 2.2.2. should be deleted.
 5. The change that was made to 2.3.1 and 2.4.1 is okay. 
 6. The changes that were made in 9.1 should be removed because the sale and 
purchase quantity is based on the DCQ.   Note that all settlements under the 
Contract are based on the DCQ and any variations between actual and DCQ is to 
be handled between the party and its transporter. 
 7. The change in 9.3 should be changed back to five (5) Days instead of 10 
Days.  5 days is the equivalent of 60 days deliveries, changing to 10 would 
mean 65 delivery days have elapsed before the Seller can notify Buyer of a 
payment default.
 8. The change in 10.2 of ""at or"" should be restored.  This is a 3 month 
deal.  Seller's position is that Buyer is responsible for any taxes at or 
after delivery.  Future Taxes are not applicable to a 3 month deal.
 9. All of the changes made to 12.2, 12.3 and 12.5 should be removed.  There 
is no partial force majeure, a party is either unable to perform because of 
the event or the party can perform.  Please explain how the loss of Buyer's 
market could be due to an event of Force Majeure and why the Buyer should not 
be required to find a new market during such period.  Force Majeure should 
only allow termination if the period extends for more than 180 Days and then 
it should only be a triggering event allowing the other party to terminate 
and collect a Termination Payment.
 10.   The change in 14 should be deleted.  There is no event which would 
allow early termination other than a Triggering Event.  
 11. Please explain the changes in 16.4.  Seller has provided all of the 
notice address information that will be put in the Contract.  No telephone 
number or other address will be added.
 12. All of the changes made to 17.1, 17.2, 17.3 and 17.4 should be deleted 
and the original language provided in my previous redline should be 
restored.  These are requirements set forth by Enron's credit requirement and 
are not subject to negotiation by me.  
 13. I have no problem with the changes proposed for 18.1, 18.2, 18.3 nor the 
addition of 18.4; however, I do not believe that either party would be able 
to locate qualified arbitrators who would agree to the shortened periods.  
Please reconsider.
 14. The changes made to the guaranty document appear to be acceptable and I 
would forward same to Enron Corp. for their consideration.

 Please review the Contract in light of the matters raised above and let me 
have your comments so that we can get this finalized as soon as possible.

1116,"THE GIFT OF LIFE
 submitted by Amber Tozer
 
On the very first day, God created the cow.  He said to the cow, ""Today I 
have created you!  As a cow, you must go to the field with the farmer all day 
long.  You will work all day under the sun!  I will give you a life span of 
50 years.""

The cow objected, ""What? This kind of tough life you want me to live for 50 
years? Let me have 20 years, and the 30 years I'll give back to you.""  So God 
agreed.

On the second day, God created the dog.  God said to the dog, ""What you are 
supposed to do is to sit all day by the door of your house.  Any people that 
come in, you will have to bark at them!  I'll give a life span of 20 years.""

The dog objected, ""What?  All day long to sit by the door? No way!  I give 
you back my other 10 years of life!""  So God agreed.

On the third day, God created the monkey.  He said to the monkey, ""Monkeys 
have to entertain people.  You've got to make them laugh and do monkey 
tricks.  I'll give you 20 years life span.""

The monkey objected. ""What?  Make them laugh?  Do monkey faces and tricks?  
Ten years will do, and the other 10 years I'll give you back.""  So God agreed.

On the fourth day, God created man and said to him, ""Your job is to sleep, 
eat, and play.  You will enjoy very much in your life.  All you need to do is 
to enjoy and do nothing.  This kind of life, I'll give you a 20 year life 
span.""

The man objected.  ""What?  Such a good life!  Eat, play, sleep, do nothing?  
Enjoy the best and you expect me to live only for 20 years?  No way, 
man!....Why don't we make a deal?  Since the cow gave you back 30 years, and 
the dog gave you back 10 years and the monkey gave you back 10 years, I will 
take them from you!  That makes my life span 70 years, right?""  So God agreed.

AND THAT'S WHY....
In our first 20 years, we eat, sleep, play, enjoy the best and do nothing 
much.  For the next 30 years, we work all day long, suffer and get to support 
the family.  For the next 10 years, we entertain our grandchildren by making 
monkey faces and monkey tricks.  And for the last 10 years, we stay at home, 
sit by the front door and bark at people! ","Amber Tozer

just did a cut of the revised document we sent to them.  As cut the language

are overlays that were completed in the system TODAY, but most were completed 
prior to this distribution and notification was sent at the time the changes 
were made.

Please also note that I will be out of the office tomorrow, so I will make 
the shortname changes in GCP this evening, after 5:p.  ERMS IT will make its 
changes tomorrow morning, Friday, March 16.

Records will be inactivated on April 2, 2001. 

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

1139,"Bill -

If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me 
like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the 
confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.  
Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the 
power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in 
Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on 
it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's 
concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.  

My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer 
has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is 
that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer 
until they are correctly completed.

In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to 
transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application 
they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it 
if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with 
changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.

1192,"Each legal trading group here in Houston checks on a relevant counterparty's 
ability to trade its products.  So far the only physical trading area where a 
governmental counterparty appears to have problems is the power trading group 
where there are licensing requirements that may or may not have been obtained 
to trade power.  For financial trading we do have to inquire into the 
relevant governmental entities' authority to enter into derivative 
transactions.  In order to do that we look at statutory authority, any 
relevant local regulations, investment policities, etc., in addition to 
obtaining legal opinions on the subject, and with some counterparties hiring 
outside counsel to advise us.  For most governmental entities if we do not 
have an ISDA Master in place and have already done such due diligence, I will 
not be approving them to trade financial products.

As far as the financial test, for the US based counterparty list, I check 
with Credit on every counterparty to determine whether they meet the US 
eligible swap participant standards.  As I'm sure you know, for most plain 
vanilla corporates and partnerships this means having total assets of $10mm 
or a net worth of $1mm.  Pretty much, if I am turning down a counterparty to 
trade financial it will be because they do not meet the ESP test or they are 
a governmental or quasi-governmental entity.

If what you are telling me is that the Australian counterparties have to meet 
a $6mm asset test to trade any products, then I will add this to my daily 
inquiry to Credit and turn down Australian counterparties if they do not meet 
this test.  At your direction I will handle this in this manner.  How would 
you like me to proceed?

1195,"Dear John:

So sorry for the delay.  I hope it hasn't caused too much inconvenience.  I 
would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I don't have 
your phone number!   Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent:

Part 1 (b)  In our other derivatives trading, the cross default test applies 
to Enron Corp. with a Threshold of US$100,000,000.  To accomplish this in the 
schedule, Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit 
Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp. guaranty and the 
dollar figure adjusted accordingly.

Part 1 (d)  Has Baker & McKenzie recommended this?  We rely on local counsel 
advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a 
bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be.  The risk in the 
automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even 
aware of the situation, i.e. the outstanding transactions terminate 
automatically, leaving us with an open, unhedged position which we are not 
able to protect since we are not aware of it.  In the U.S. the bankruptcy 
code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the 
terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge.

Part 1 (e)  We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the 
non-defaulting party the most flexibility.  Market Quotation is often 
suggested because of its apparent objective nature.  However, in many of the 
markets where we operate, quotations will not be available, where they are 
available they may well not be meaningful, and the Loss method gives 
flexibility (while still requiring commercial reasonableness).

Part 1 (h)(ix)  This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is 
no collateral annex.   When we have the ability to ask for (or be asked for) 
collateral in the case of a downgrading, we build that event into the 
Paragraph 13 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires 
the posting of collateral to cover any open position.  If the party fails, it 
then becomes a default allowing termination.

Part 1 (h)(x)  Wouldn't the cross default be triggered before this could 
happen?

Part 2  Have our internal Tax people approved this?

Part 3  I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of 
the corporate documents referred to.  Since Enron Corp. will be a Credit 
Support Provider, does it have a Representative Director, etc.?

The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does 
not think it necessary.  In many non-US jurisdictions, local counsel have 
advised that an opinion be obtained - in some cases derivatives transactions 
are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business 
and therefore require special board approval; in others, derivatives would 
not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made 
in the corporate documents, etc.

Part 5 (b) (g)&(h) These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind 
(although they may be helpful for other reasons as well).  If neither party 
is in the US, the CFTC reason may go away.  On the other hand, since we are 
choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law 
applies as well.  If that is our theory, there are additional representations 
(the Eligible Swap Participant reps) that we should think about putting back 
in.

Part 5 (d)  We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section 
to make reference to the ISDA 2000 definitions.  While I think we will get 
there, we haven't actually made the decision yet.  So far I guess we leave it 
the way it is.

Part 5 (j)  My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp. 
guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity.  Any differences in 
Japan from US practice we should be worried about?

Paragraph 13  I have to admit I'm not as familiar with the Paragraph 13 
provisions as the Schedule.  My only concern here is with the MAC clause and 
it looks like there's a glitch in the form.  It seems to me that if the 
counterparty is only rated by one of the 2 major agencies we shouldn't be 
pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us.  The way it is 
drafted now if either S&P or Moody's stops rating us, even if the remaining 
rating is very high we will have a MAC occur.  The counterparty doesn't have 
to worry about Moody's at all.  Just a thought.

On the guaranty, you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction 
changes past Clement Abrams at Corp. Legal.  My only comment is that we would 
usually have a cap that is a bit higher (in this case maybe an extra 
$5,000,000) than the threshold in the CSA - that gives the counterparty a 
little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is 
exceeded.

Tana is preparing a red-line for me that hopefully will show all of the 
changes between the US form and the Japan form.  I may have a few more 
comments after I see how that comes out but don't expect many.

I hope this is helpful.  Please feel free to call and we can walk through 
these over the phone if that would be useful.  We should also talk about the 
most efficient way to prepare these going forward.  It might make sense for 
Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft 
which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty.  It 
may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on 
other things.

We're looking forward to having you back.

Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.",Jerry Martin Larry Izzo,,"Enron EES EECC Enron Transportation Services the

until released by the Exchange staff as specified below.  All adjustments 
and/or corrections, must be accompanied by relevant supporting documentation 
prior to being incorporated into expiration processing, in essence making the

later than 30 minutes after floor representatives are released.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110), Floor Trade Correction (299-2068 and 299-2169)

problems you may have.

1241," I left both of you a voice mail last night and I listened to it, but you 
probably did not hear my message very well due to a bad line.  Ultimately, 
Cassandra is needing some information on brokerage accounts first thing 
tomorrow morning (Wed., 11/15).  She will be going to San Antonio early 
afternoon and is needing to review a brokerage account document for Ted 
Murphy's signature.  Tana, as I mentioned in my voice mail, when Ted doesn't 
understand information that is requiring his signature, he will not sign it 
until he fully understands it.  Therefore, it is imperative that we get a 
listing of all brokerage accounts and the specific commodity groups they are 
currently work with (if available) to Cassandra as soon as possible; 
otherwise it will have to wait until Monday.  If I remember correctly, most 
of the brokerage agreements that need to be signed require a rush signature.  

Also, Cassandra needs to be able to sign off on these documents as Ted is on 
his way to London effective January 01; therefore we need to figure out a way 
that she should be added sooner rather than later.  I realize that Mark 
Taylor is out of the office until Monday; however, can Alan Aronowitz approve 
this request on his behalf?

Can you please give Cassandra a call at x30429 first thing so we can resolve

The corporate workbook reflects that the officers of Enron Credit, Inc. all

As there may be tax issues associated with U.K. officers signing (in the U.K)

My suggestion is that Enron Credit Ltd. negotiate and execute the agreement 
and include the usual ""affiliates, representatives, etc."" who may need to 
know any confidential information.  Your V.P.'s are all in London.  

If Janelle confirms that it's alright for Brown, Sherriff or Seyfried to sign 
for Enron Credit, Inc. from London, then we can prepare the document and have 
a V.P. sign and fax the agreement to the U.S. party.  At a minimum, though, 
we should try to work from our form of NDA.

contained in the atty.fms bank, not the Swap Group's forms.  We have 
developed a few of our own forms for special purposes, one, which is in the 
swap forms database/current forms, protects the counterparty only, and is 
used when Credit wants to get copies of financal statements from a 
counterparty and protects the financial information being provided by the 
counterparty.

I have developed forms for use by the EnronOnline team, but those should not 
be used for any Enron company except EnronOnline and Enron Net Works.

For any other types of matters/projects, we would also use the forms

We sent Chisholm an electronic copy of the LOI and received some comments.  

in paragraph 2, Chisholm would like to see something other than obligation, as we never state what is our 'current obligation.'  I guess the word 'obligation' raises an eyebrow.  We explained that the NDA and its conditions would still be in place.  Is there a way to tweak the language to more clearly state this and not use 'obligation'?

of course the non-solicitation clause was another point of clarification.  Currently, Chisholm is using students to develop an internal system and they have been working with other vendors.   Therefore, this clause will not work.  So we have discussed putting in a Notification clause in that Chisholm will notify us and keep us informed about the status of other vendors.  Perhaps something that would read ""Chisholm agrees that it will notify Enron if and when it decides to enter into a formal agreement with any third party vendor etc.""   


Give me a call if this doesn't make sense.  Thanks.

Below is a form NDA for Cargill/CommodityLogic.  The form is Cargill's form and mirrors the agreement we reached earlier this year between Cargill and NetWorks.  That agreement was negotiated with Anne Pedrero with Cargill eVentures in San Mateo, CA.  Whether or not she is the individual who should look at this agreement is up to the personnel you are dealing with at Cargill.  I would suggest, however, that if another legal person does get involved, that they be instructed to contact Ms. Pedrero to verify the terms of the agreement previously negotiated.

Please let me know if you should need anything further -- phone calls are okay.

Thanks for the response.

A couple of notes:
we somehow want to incorporate that Chisholm will not solicit or work with another front end software vendor until after February 2001 (as that is when they will be ready to begin).
we have discussed pricing with Chisholm and would like to include as an attachment the following spreadsheet so that they know we are willing to tier the proposed pricing.

 
I made some comments within the document, we can discuss via phone if you would like.

 
Lastly, we want to make sure that we are not getting 'too legal' in this letter as we have established a good rapport with Chisholm and don't want to scare them off.  I hope this makes sense.

RE: CFTC Approves Amendments to Natural Gas Price Limit Rules

DATE: December 7, 2000

Notice # 00-419

______________________________________________

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has received permission from the=20
Commodity Futures Trading Commission to expand the initial price limits of=
=20
its natural gas futures contracts; create uniform limits across all months =
of=20
trading; abbreviating the trading halt; and expand the new limits by 200%=
=20
when the initial limit is reached.

The amended rules, which are attached, will take effect for the opening of=
=20
the open outcry tading session at 9:30 AM tomorrow.

The Exchange announced this morning that the board last night voted to amen=
d=20
the procedures so the new natural gas limit will be $1.000 per million=20
British thermal unit and if any contract month is traded, bid, or offered a=
t=20
the limit for five minutes, the market is halted for 15 minutes.  When=20
trading resumes, expanded limits are in place that allow the price to=20
fluctuate by $2.000 in either direction of the previous day's settlement=20
price.

Currently, the market is halted for one hour if the price in one of the fir=
st=20
two months is traded at $.750 for five minutes.  When the market reopens,=
=20
those limits are extended to all months, but are moved to surround the=20
previous limit in place in the direction of the move.

Under the amended rules, if a halt occurs during the last two days of tradi=
ng=20
in a contract, when the market reopens, there are no price limits placed on=
=20
either of the first two nearby contract months.

NATURAL GAS: APPROVED AMENDMENTS TO PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMIT RULES

The rules below reflect the provisions that are being implemented.  A copy =
of=20
the rules reflecting the changes made from the prior version of these rules=
=20
can be obtained from the Exchange=01,s Legal Department.

Rule 220.08. PRICES AND MINIMUM FLUCTUATION SIZE

(A) Prices shall be quoted in dollars and cents per million British thermal=
=20
units (MMBtu). The minimum price fluctuation shall be $.001 per MMBtu.

Rule 220.08A. SPECIAL PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS  FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES

(A) Initial Price Fluctuation Limits for All Contract Months. At the=20
commencement of each trading day, there shall be price fluctuation limits i=
n=20
effect for each contract month of this futures contract of $1.00 per MMBtu=
=20
above or below the previous day=01,s settlement price for such contract mon=
th.

(B)(1) Triggering Event and Temporary Trading Halt. If a market for any=20
contract month is traded or, is bid in the case of upward price moves or is=
=20
offered in the case of downward price moves, for five (5) minutes=20
consecutively at the upper or lower price limit, as applicable, then a=20
Triggering Event will be deemed to have occurred.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, as a result of such Triggeri=
ng=20
Event, the market will be given notice immediately that in two (2) minutes,=
=20
there will be a fifteen (15) minute temporary trading halt in all contract=
=20
months of that futures contract and the associated option contract=20
(""Temporary Trading Halt""). The market will remain open during this=20
two-minute notice period, and the commencement of the Temporary Trading Hal=
t=20
shall not be affected by market activity occurring during this notice perio=
d.

(3) Expansion of Limits Following Temporary Trading Halt. Following the end=
=20
of the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, the market shall reopen in all=20
contract months of this futures contract.  When trading resumes, price=20
fluctuation limits for each contract month, except as otherwise provided in=
=20
this rule, shall be expanded to $2.00 per MMBtu above and below the previou=
s=20
day=01,s settlement price for such contract month;

provided that if such Temporary Trading Halt occurs on either of the last t=
wo=20
days of trading in the current delivery month, when trading resumes, there=
=20
shall be no price fluctuation limits in effect for the remainder of the=20
trading day both for the current delivery month and for the next nearest=20
contract month to delivery.

(4) Following resumption of trading after a Temporary Trading Halt, there=
=20
shall be no additional trading halts and no further expansion of price limi=
ts=20
for the remainder of the trading day.

(C) Duration of Session Following Temporary Trading Halt.   When trading=20
resumes after a Temporary Trading Halt, trading generally shall continue=20
until the regularly scheduled closing time subject to the following=20
exceptions:

1) if, at the start of the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, there is less=
=20
than 15 minutes
before the close, then, when trading resumes after the Temporary Trading=20
Halt, the trading session shall be expanded as necessary to provide for=20
fifteen (15) minutes of trading following the resumption of trading, and th=
e=20
closing period shall be the final two minutes of trading of this 15-minute=
=20
period of trading;

2) provided however that if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed=
=20
during  the
closing period (on any day other than the last day of trading in the curren=
t=20
delivery month), there shall be no Temporary Trading Halt for any contract=
=20
month and no expansion of price limits for any contract month; and

3) provided further that if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed=
=20
during  the
closing period on the last day of trading in the current delivery month,=20
following the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, trading shall resume for=20
thirty (30) minutes for all contract months. In such circumstances, the=20
closing range for the current delivery month shall include both the period=
=20
from the start of the closing range to the start of the Temporary Trading=
=20
Halt as well as the 30-minutes of trading following resumption of trading.

(D) Application of Price Fluctuation Limits to NYMEX ACCESSc  The limits=20
described in this rule shall apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESSc, except as=
=20
provided by NYMEX Rule 6.56 and except that:

(1) if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed during the last ninety=

minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc trading session, there shall be no Temporary=20

Thanks for the message.  I will get the letter and Password App. out to you 
tomorrow.  As to the ETA, the reason we do a side letter on the changes is 
because every user of EnronOnline is required to ""click"" on the on-line ETA 
prior to using the system.  Accordingly, the process is really this - 

- PGW completes the PA and submits it to EnronOnline
- Presuming approval of the PA, EnronOnline issues the appropriate password 
and user id to PGW
 - PGW signs onto the system using the password and user id
 - After being asked to change the password, the on-line ETA appears and PGW 
must ""click"" to accept in order to use the system

Since the ETA is not agreed to until access is first obtained to the system, 
if you want to wait to sign the amendment letter, that is fine.  Either way, 
I will have them forwarded.

Please let me know if you should need anything further.

1. OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as accuratel=
y=20

=20
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its=
=20
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other=20

(c) If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a strike=
=20
price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position in a=

=20
liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of expiration=
=20
and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your projected=20
position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of actual traded=

series.  Please check this statement carefully.  Although long options=20
positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be automatically exercised,=
=20

manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note that there also may =
be=20
some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E) At approximately 9:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be=20

1336,"Executive Summary
? Davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for 
past utility debt
? Davis and PG&E negotiations at a standstill, sticking point is net short 
for PG&E this summer 
? As the days go on with no word of a secured deal, involuntary bankruptcy 
chances increase significantly among small generators and QFs
? FERC would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions 
for California

California Public Utility Commission Rate Increases 
Today may be the turning point as the CA PUC reviews the size of the 
Department of Water Resources  (DWR) rate increase to be passed along to 
consumers on their electricity bills.  Until now, Davis has considered rate 
hikes to be political suicide, but there may be some relief for him from 
consumer groups.   Sources indicate that one of California's main consumer 
advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption, 
but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt.  DWR, 
which is currently buying power on behalf of the state, needs more income to 
securitize the planned $10B bond issue that is key part of Davis' plan to 
sign long term power contracts.  As DWR continues to spend $40 to $60 M every 
day on power purchases, a well placed source informed us the DWR is 
essentially bankrupt.  It currently has no money for normal activities such 
as ordering supplies, purchasing new equipment, etc.  The Department of 
Finance is forwarding DWR money from where ever it can (parks, other 
programs) to purchase power, but DWR's hands are tied until revenue bonds are 
issued.  The California State Treasurer Phil Angelides will be submitting a 
recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $10 
billion worth of state bonds. 

Davis & PG&E at Odds 
Sources report that Davis and PG&E negotiations are facing two difficult 
challenges: 1) PG&E wants 2.9 times book, which is far more than consumer 
groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines (SCE accepted 2.3), 
and 2) PG&E needs relief from Davis for PG&Es legal responsibility to be the 
ultimate power purchaser for the state, and at this point Davis wants to 
limit further state energy power purchases (especially for summer).  The 
utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars 
further in the red ($3 to $4 B) and PG&E may declare bankruptcy for their 
utility subsidiary if Davis tries to force the issue.  Additionally, Davis is 
being hounded by the press and Harvey Rosenfield to publish details of the 
states' 40 long-term power contracts; a measure that if accomplished would 
provide Davis with even less negotiating power.

With all this activity, Davis is starting to lose support in the state 
legislature.  Sources report increasing tension between the Governor and 
State Senate President Pro-tem John Burton.  Burton has just announced a 
special Senate Committee will investigate the generators for evidence of 
price manipulation, and the State Auditor is also planning an investigation.  
Davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being 
picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later.

QF's Most Likely Source of Involuntary Bankruptcy
Sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience 
and force bankruptcy on the utilities.  SB 47X may have been California's 
Qualified Facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing 
against PG&E, SoCal Ed, and SDG&E.  The bill designed to cut the QF's costs 
and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the State's 
senate.  Sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further 
investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates.

Out with Hebert, In with Wood
The Bush administration favors replacing Hebert, Jr. with Texas PUC head Pat 
Wood.  There is an intense battle behind the scenes between Senate Republican 
Leader Trent Lott , who favors Hebert, and President Bush, who wants Wood.  
The administration would prefer Wood because they do not want FERC to pick a 
fight with Davis which means Bush might ultimately lose some western states 
in 2004.  In effort to tone down the recent press reports, Hebert has made 
several token concessions to California, including $69 million worth of power 
refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and 
power plant installation.  

It's is expected that FERC would most likely approve any transmission deal 
that Davis could complete but with a list of conditions.  Some conditions 
might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well 
as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic Administrative actions in 
the West next year.  The Bush Administration is opposed to price caps and 
believes in free market solutions.  The Administration is also considering 
whether it might be a good idea to privatize Federally-owned assets such as 
BPA.

In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20
implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20
continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20
people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets=
,=20
and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20
within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the=
=20
corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th=
e=20
following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the=
=20
Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.

1) Coverage/Origination:

To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=
=20
technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20
businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=
=20
under the leadership of Dave Delainey :
a) the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination groups whic=
h=20
focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and g=
as=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;
b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=
=20
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20
including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=
d=20
mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=
=20
textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20
Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=
t=20
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=
=20
ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=
=20
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=
=20
Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=
=20
will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=
gy=20
commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=
es=20
but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=
als,=20
plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional=
=20
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=
=20
groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=
=20
will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20
leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=
=20
sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:
a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=
=20
activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=
or=20
the provision of innovative=20
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=
n=20
of paper risk management products;
b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=
o=20
lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20
chemicals and refined products industries;
c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=
=20
Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=
 the=20
coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t=
he=20
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20
heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=
s=20
and glass manufacturing industries.




Midstream Coverage/Origination

a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=
n=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern=
=20
Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi=
s=20
group;
b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =
on=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The=
y=20
will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20
opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the=
=20
leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20
Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort=
s;
c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f=
ocus on=20
the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20
emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc=
hant=20
power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked =
=20
Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will=
=20
continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20
Interconnect;
d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=
ing=20
opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20
restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav=
e=20
asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20
formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=
=20
Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=
=20
this newly formed business.

2) Commercial Transactions:=20

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=
=20
transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=
ecuting=20
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=
=20
of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20
Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=
=20
Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=
=20
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=
=20
with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=
=20
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This=
=20
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=
=20
and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=
=20
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:

a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=
=20
Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20
include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=
=20
Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=
=20
Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=
=20
from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20
origination.
b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=
ial=20
origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20
Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=
=20
established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=
=20
Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing=
=20
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=
=20
Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni=
or=20
members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=
nd=20
John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the=
=20
Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We=
=20
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=
=20
weeks.
d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20
Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu=
de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=
=20
of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=
=20
Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=
=20
responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will=
=20
continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=
=20
commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=
l=20
responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20
Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=
n=20
largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20
Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located=
=20
together.

We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=
e=20
and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=
al=20
markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=
en=20
the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20

Chonawee and Tom Halliburton had  feedback about Jacob to me.

Tom's feedback is what he does for Pros is actually too simple. Their 
so-called 
trading system is actually a scheduling system.

My impression is that Jacob is good at selling himself, his knowledge
of finance and derivatives is very limited.

We talked to Rabi. He's sitting on the fence for some good reasons, and he 
has to weigh what is fairly comfy job situation for one that starts out at a 
lower level but has more potential.   WRT the GREEN, Vince verbally offered 
salary of $105k plus a guarantee that his bonus at year end would be a 
minimum of $15k cash.  That's in addition to the $15k sign on bonus.  Vince 
said that we would not bother working up a revised offer letter unless and 
until Rabi came back with a verbal ok.  He will ponder the offer; probably 
for a few more days and get back with us.  He may well call you to discuss

CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it more a
production tool.

We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM has)
in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick
worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar tool
for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet (hopefully) later
this week. 

I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can
consider it as commercial product.

1363,"Japan's Electricity Newspaper (""Denki Shimbun"", the equivalent of Megawatt 
Daily) has been running a series of articles about the new century.  Several 
of these have focused on the power industry in the U.S.  A friend of mine ran 
across one on Enron that was published on April 13 and sent it to me.  I 
thought you would find it interesting.

The article focuses on EES in particular and about how we try to succeed by 
being first to meet our clients' changing needs.  It also describes how we 
use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive.  
The article also briefly mentions the new office in Japan.

The most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is 
about Enron.  Given what I have read and heard about how nervous the Japanese 
are about deregulation of the industry, I really did not expect such praise.

Denki Shimbun also has a web site at ""www.shimbun.denki.or.jp"".  They have 
small summaries of the important articles of the day (the site, however, is 
completely in Japanese).  Another interesting site is 
""www.criepi.denken.or.jp"", the English home site of Japan's Central Research 
Institute of Electric Power Industry (Denryoku Chuo Kenkyuujou).  The site 
has many links to other English-language sites related to the power industry

Title: Crude Oil Price Outlook after September 11
URL(s):

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2743;


***********************************************************************

CERA's CRUDE OIL PRICE OUTLOOK

In this uncertain environment, CERA has made assumptions about how events will
unfold in order to form a price outlook, and then has assessed the risks.

* CERA's revised oil demand forecast is for a gain of just 0.3 million
barrels per day (mbd) in 2002. The trend during 2002 is for a sharp year-on-
year drop in demand in the first quarter of 0.7 mbd,, followed by a 1.3 mbd
increase in the fourth quarter as economic recovery sets in.

* Contrasting against this message of very weak oil demand growth is CERA's
outlook for a 1.0 mbd year-on-year gain in non-OPEC supply in 2002.

* As a result, the potential exists for a dramatic oversupply of oil next
year unless OPEC restrains its production. CERA's view is that OPEC continues
to restrain production in late 2001 and 2002 in an attempt to shore up prices.

                  Our goal is to validate that the Enron Global Market book 
administrators are accurately using the ""spread option model"" as developed by 
the Research Group.    To determine this, we would like to provide you with 
the inputs for a particular deal (as provided by a Global Markets book 
administrator) and have you recalculate the deal value.   We will then 
compare your results to the values calculated by Global Markets.

 Two Koch deals have been chosen due to their substantial P/L effect.  I have 
attached the deal data in two forms: (1) the spread option model that Kara 
Boudreau, Book Administrator EGM, provided and (2) an excel spreadsheet that 
isolates the 2 deals.

I am forwarding you a message I received a few days ago. I want to ask you 
for advice how to handle this case.

My first  reaction was to ignore it. The longer I think about it, the more 
convinced I become that some action 
is required.

Let's try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a 
female employee
was harassed by a male colleague. An employee informs her boss a few months 
later about
the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it. In many similar 
cases, courts  subsequently 
found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such 
complaints.

The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is 
immaterial. 
If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double 
standard in
handling sexual harassment cases.

My recommendation would be to ask Maureen to attend sensitivity training and 
sexual harassment prevention class.

Please, let me know what you think. Sorry to burden you with this case.

============================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update - 8/6/2001

Morgan Stanley swept the board at RiskNews' sister publication Credit magazine's second annual European analysts' survey this week, claiming 12 first place awards out of 17 categories for credit research excellence. The firm improved on its performance last year, when it was in the top five in eight of 14 categories. Morgan Stanley credit strategist Neil McLeish typified his firm's performance having risen from fourth place last year to claim the top spot in the strategy sector this time around. Merrill Lynch also performed well, with 13 mentions as a top-five firm in the 17 categories, including first places for high-yield telecoms & media, high-yield industrials, and index provider categories. Another outright winner was Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, which topped the high-grade consumer products sector. A full version of the Credit magazine awards is available at www.creditmag.com.

More responses to the proposed Basel capital Accords - Basel II - emerged this week. The Institute of International Finance, the US-based association whose membership includes Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and UBS, said it was concerned that the proposals may result in an excessively conservative and costly capital framework that overestimates the amount of risk on banks' balance sheets. Separately, investment managers said Basel's move to cover operational risk is flawed.

In Asia, meanwhile, Credit Lyonnais issued what it claims are the first call warrants on a basket of Chinese 'B shares', following the decision by China's securities regulator to allow local Chinese to buy these shares, which previously were only available to international investors.

Finally, RiskNews will report extensive coverage of events at Risk magazine's Risk 2001 USA conference in Boston next week. Look for top stories in the conference update box on www.riksnews.net

for you. 
The P/L results are investigated by assuming different scenarios.

The key variable is the number of trade per day, therefore is varied  from 
200 to 1000 trades.

Scenarios are generated by different spreads, net open position allowed, and 
time period.

Take a look what I have prepared, and let me know things you want to add or

1410,"John,

I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and 
elimination of
risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out  in other messages). Being 
aware of risk
does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.

Now a few more detailed comments.

1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined 
with 
a project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view,
should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without 
sufficient depth.
One should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time. The 
approach used in valuation
of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of 
investments in physical
assets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity  is recognized 
through other aspects
of valuation technology used in RAROC. 

If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent 
and use
this approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that 
I recommend this course of action).

2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.

Let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.

He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the 
floor for
the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as 
opposed to taking a vol
risk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes 
fuzzy.
The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on 
two factors:

1. risk preference
2. existing portfolio positions

Risk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that 
consists of two parts:
expected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2 
standard deviations.
The number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability 
to absorb the loss.
I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We 
looked into insurance pricing at the
request of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more 
about it.

Existing portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease 
the risk of the overall portfolio.
I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not 
look to me as a deal that reduces risk
(given all our positions in this region).

What are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the 
utility function of a decision maker
in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary. 

If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged,
we should subtract from the value of the contract
the value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value).
If we don't price this option explicitly,
the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk 
premium.

In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot 
hedge, he should recognize the risk
of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of 
the option.
How big is the discount? See the comments above. 

In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton 
paradigm applies, both values
will become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form 
the point of view of 
a seller and a buyer will converge.

3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?

We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will 
recognize the downside and/or
upside at different points in time in different states of the world).
If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of 
NPV as of today.
Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases 
we are still holding
it. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is 
equivalent to using a 
discount rate with a risk premium.

I hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a 
delay in responding
to this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we 
all agree.
It's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not 
have
good answers.

A few comments on the model:

1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like 
to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of 
our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the 
details and in the inputs and
calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results 
depending
on the quality of inputs. 

2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We

State's Utilities Could Be in Hot Water as Bills Are Due Power: Whether they 
can collect funds for escalating costs is a question that worries Wall 
Street, others.
CHRIS KRAUL

As the meter runs on California's electricity crisis, shock over this 
summer's price spikes is giving way to a new concern: uncertainty over 
whether and how the state's three investor-owned utilities can collect the 
staggering amounts in power costs they haven't been allowed to pass through 
to consumers. 
The unanswered question is how high the bill--now $4 billion and 
counting--will go, and whether consumers will foot all or part of it. And 
that there are no easy answers--perhaps short of an overhaul of the state's 
deregulated power market, or legislation from officials seemingly reluctant 
to act--only adds to the growing anxiety. 
Rate freezes in effect at Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric 
and San Diego Gas & Electric, which serve about three-quarters of the state's 
residents and businesses, are forcing the utilities to borrow an estimated $1 
billion a month to cover their added wholesale costs. Those loans are 
draining the companies' resources and threatening their financial structure, 
analysts say. 
The rising unpaid balance presents a longer-term burden that worries Wall 
Street, the state's business interests and, of course, the utilities. If 
passed along to consumers, the amount could ultimately negate the promised 
benefits of cheap energy that were the reason for being for the landmark 
deregulation of California's electricity industry. But making the utilities 
absorb the entire ""undercollections"" would strike a grievous financial blow 
to the companies. 
The crisis also has created a potential time bomb for shareholders of parent 
companies Edison International and PG&E Corp. Skyrocketing wholesale 
electricity costs are canceling out deregulation's underlying assumption of 
low-cost wholesale energy--and the projected generous retail margins with 
which utilities were to pay off nuclear plants and other uneconomical assets. 
The deregulation law gave utilities until March 2002 to complete the payoff, 
when open-market conditions would take over in their service areas. But with 
wholesale electricity costs where they are, the ""stranded asset"" balances are 
growing instead of shrinking--and posing an enormous potential hit for 
shareholders, who would have to absorb the remaining ""bad asset"" costs after 
the deadline passes. 
Whether the companies' shareholders or ratepayers--or both--end up footing 
the undercollection bill, all Californians could pay in the long run, 
analysts say, if current market problems remain unresolved and the state is 
seen as a less attractive place in which to do business. 
How will it all shake out? Wall Street is as much in the dark as 
Californians, said Lori Woodland, an analyst with Fitch Inc. of Chicago, one 
of three debt-rating agencies to recently lower their outlooks for Southern 
California Edison, PG&E, SDG&E and their parent companies. 
""It's not clear how regulators view this issue,"" Woodland said. ""They may 
permit the utilities to recover their costs [from ratepayers]; they may not. 
That's a big uncertainty, and it may remain this way for months. Meanwhile, 
power prices are very high, and significant amounts of money are flowing out 
the door of the utilities."" 
The uncertain prospects for collecting those billions of dollars also affect 
stock prices, and PG&E in particular has slumped in recent days as the 
implications register with investors. From a high of $31.64 on Sept. 11, PG&E 
shares have dropped to Thursday's close of $23.19 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
Amid the finger pointing and doubts, many wonder if electricity deregulation 
itself could be junked and the state's power industry re-regulated. Others 
suggest that rate freezes be extended indefinitely or hope that the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission now investigating the California electricity 
market will take corrective action to make it all better. 
Although the parties involved all seem fearful of the dimension of the crisis 
and doubtful of any near-term solution, consensus couldn't be less evident 
among the major players on how to deal with it. Although all three utilities 
agree the current market isn't working, they have not come forward with a 
common plan to solve the crisis and aren't working on one, sources say. 
Partial lifting of the rate freezes is advocated by PG&E Corp. and Sempra 
Energy, parent of SDG&E, the first state utility to pay off its stranded 
costs and thus be allowed to fully pass along wholesale costs to customers. 
The state Legislature has since stepped in to freeze SDG&E rates after a 
political firestorm fed by customer protests over bills that doubled and even 
tripled during the summer. 
Lifting the rate freeze would stem the tide of electricity undercollections, 
a sum the utilities realize is not necessarily collectible in the current 
political climate. 
""We have to fix these retail rates, which mask the true cost of electricity 
and which are creating the shortfall,"" said SDG&E President Edwin A. Guiles. 
In San Diego, for example, the average price paid by SDG&E customers zoomed 
from 11 cents per kilowatt-hour last year to 28 cents at its highest point 
this summer, before the Legislature stepped in to cap the rates, bringing the 
average price paid down to about 10 cents. 
So tinkering with the rate freeze could be politically hazardous. 
""The pain we saw in San Diego this summer is something we want to avoid for 
our customers in Northern and Central California,"" said PG&E spokesman Jon 
Tremayne. 
PG&E is expected soon to formally petition the state Public Utilities 
Commission to lift its rate freeze. The San Francisco-based utility argues 
that the $2.8-billion value of its Northern California hydroelectric 
properties, which under deregulation it is required to divest, would erase 
its stranded costs and make it eligible to pass along wholesale costs to 
consumers. 
Southern California Edison's chief financial officer, Jim Scilacci, said the 
utility could possibly be eligible to lift the rate freeze later this year if 
planned asset sales bring high enough prices. 
But with the legally mandated rate freeze in effect in San Diego, observers 
doubt that the state would let PG&E and Edison revert to market prices. 
In response, some consumer advocates are saying, in effect: Let the 
utilities, which ignored warnings of the electricity shortages at the root of 
the summer's price spikes, lie in the beds they made and pay the unforeseen 
costs of deregulation themselves. 
""Essentially this is the result of a deal gone wrong. It's buyer's remorse,"" 
said Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San Diego 
watchdog group. ""The utilities cut a deal, and now they don't like the terms 
of the deal and they want out of it."" 
Somewhat more flexible is Ed Yates, senior vice president of the 
Sacramento-based California League of Food Processors, whose energy-intensive 
industry could be devastated by the full brunt of high wholesale energy 
costs. 
""What frightens us is that the utilities and the state could declare the rate 
freeze over and we'd have a San Diego situation,"" Yates said, referring to 
how the rising summer power costs made some San Diego County agricultural 
products noncompetitive. ""What we want is rate stability. But I don't see a 
solution. There are powerful interests at work who don't agree on the goal."" 
State officials are divided, with some including PUC President Loretta Lynch 
looking to the federal government to impose order. Gov. Gray Davis has 
discussed holding an energy summit next month to try to hash out solutions, 
but no date or agenda have been set. 
""The governor is obviously aware of the problems that California utilities 
are facing and continues to be committed to making deregulation work and is 
calling on everyone involved to act in a responsible way,"" said spokesman 
Steve Maviglio, adding that Davis has set aside much of October to work on 
the problem. 
Lynch made it clear she will be unreceptive to any solution that would have 
consumers absorbing all of the undercollections and that resolving the 
utilities' huge debts must come as part of a comprehensive overhaul of 
California's dysfunctional electricity market. 
""I don't think there is a simple solution. The utilities have a problem, I 
agree, but the resolution is much more complex than having the ratepayer eat 
the bill,"" Lynch said. ""The answer lies in a broader solution of addressing 
the wholesale energy market."" 
Unclear is how long Wall Street would wait for some kind of resolution before 
downgrading utilities' debt, the next step after the negative outlook 
revisions. 
""There are obviously many challenges presented to the power industry,"" said 
Standard & Poor's David Bodek. ""The costs are very high and at the end of the 
day have to be borne by someone. If it's the utilities, there are financial 
implications that could impact credit quality."" ","CHRIS KRAUL Lori Woodland Edwin A. Guiles Jon

1473,"Thanks for your message. I do think we need to talk this through.  In the 
meantime, though, let's not make anymore VPs until this is resolved.  As I 
said in my original message, I am not looking to undo what has been done, but 
to make sure we don't do it again unless the process is followed.

 I understand that there are significant title differences across the regions 
we operate.  In fact, one of the people in my organization who did not make 
VP is Dennis Vegas, who has done an extraordinary job in Latin America.  
Notwithstanding his regional focus (and the significance of a VP title in his 
region) he was put through the company wide process and he, David Haug, and I 
submit, everyone else on the Exec Comm, understood that every new VP would go 
through the same process regardless of regional assignment (with the 
exception of certain joint venture companies). But, I maintain that we need 
some consistency in the VP title in particular -- i.e. that it remain an 
Enron-wide title, granted only through the PRC process.  Though I don't 
personally feel this way, for many people in the organization the VP title 
means something separate from the compensation structure; it implies 
something like ""making partner"" in a legal or consulting firm. Making that 
cut should not vary based on where you live or what region you support.

 I also understand the point about needing a certain title for external 
purposes.  In my organization we are dealing with very title-conscious 
elected officials and media.  I can make the case for every one of my 
directors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally 
if they carried a more senior title, regardless of any change in 
compensation.  As an executive committee, we elected to make such an 
exception only for ""legacy"" title holders -- i.e. people who had previously 
made VP outside the process.  Everyone in my organization

Markets Utility Stocks May Stall Amid Tech Rebound 
THOMAS S. MULLIGAN

Home Edition

Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company 
NEW YORK -- Electric utility stocks, driven by strong power demand, falling 
bond yields and defensive-minded investors, have had a remarkable year so 
far. 
The Dow Jones utility stock index is up 36% year to date, while most U.S. 
blue-chip indexes are in the red. 
But in recent weeks many utility stocks have flattened. California's current 
power crisis notwithstanding, analysts note that we are headed into the part 
of the year when electricity demand slackens. 
Is the utility sector played out for now? Is it time to take profits and move 
on? 
Experts who follow electric utilities say much depends on the rest of the 
stock market. It's no accident that major utility indexes hit bottom in the 
second week of March, just as the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index was 
soaring to its all-time high. 
Now, if tech stocks continue to recover from their spring and summer 
collapse, that could divert money from utility shares, analysts say. When a 
traditionally exciting sector like tech is red-hot, nobody wants to hear 
about utility stocks, said Doris Kelley-Watkins, portfolio manager of the 
Evergreen Utility Fund. 
Many investors who initially piled into utility issues in winter and spring 
were seeking a safe haven as Nasdaq plunged: With their high-dividend yields, 
big utility companies have long been favorite defensive plays. 
But then came the summer peak power-use season, and the country woke up to 
the reality of an electricity shortage. Utility stocks zoomed. The terrific 
gains ""were a real boon to investors who came here thinking they were going 
to be bored,"" Kelley-Watkins said. 
Indeed, stocks of firms such as Dynegy (ticker symbol: DYN), Calpine (CPN), 
Reliant Energy (REI) and Duke Energy (DUK) are up more than 70% so far this 
year. 
Kelley-Watkins, like a number of Wall Street analysts, believes that the 
""easy money"" in utility stocks already has been made. Nevertheless, there 
will still be opportunities in the sector as long as generating capacity 
stays tight--which it is sure to do for at least two or three more years, she 
said. 
Some new power plants will be coming online toward the end of 2002, 
Kelley-Watkins added, but the current supply squeeze has been more than a 
decade in the making and will not be quickly solved. 
Hence, some of the biggest gainers this year are utilities that have 
extensive energy-trading operations--Duke and Reliant, for example. They 
could continue to take advantage of soaring demand and unusual volatility, 
Kelley-Watkins said. 
Dynegy and Houston-based Enron (ENE), the nation's biggest wholesale power 
marketer as well as a major trader of natural gas and other commodities, are 
among the Evergreen fund's biggest holdings. 
Kelley-Watkins also thinks that Sempra Energy (SRE), parent of San Diego Gas 
& Electric, has made a good transition from a heavily regulated owner of 
power plants to an energy distributor and transmitter. But she shies away 
from Sempra's giant California cousins, PG&E (PCG) and Edison International 
(EIX, parent of Southern California Edison), which she considers too 
debt-burdened. 
Nobody welcomes a recession, but Timothy M. Winter, analyst at A.G. Edwards 
in St. Louis, said an economic downturn probably would help utility stocks, 
as many remain relatively cheap in terms of price-to-earnings ratios, and 
would continue to be viewed as a defensive haven. 
The presidential election outcome also matters, Winter said. Most Wall 
Streeters think a George W. Bush victory would be a plus for the sector 
because he probably would be more open than Al Gore to new power plant 
construction. 
Winter likes Progress Energy (PGN), formerly Carolina Power & Light, because 
of its dominance in the fast-growing Southeast. His firm also recommends 
American Electric Power (AEP) and Xcel Energy (XEL). 
Michael S. Worms, analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York, said 
although electric-utility earnings should continue strong into next year, it 
will be hard to duplicate this year's 20% average profit gains. ""We had a 
phenomenal year because of tight capacity and high prices,"" Worms said. 
Utility stocks probably would have done well on such business fundamentals, 
but they also received a strong tail wind from the stumbling tech sector, 
said Worms. 
If tech shares have bottomed, and if the Federal Reserve speeds the market's 
recovery with interest-rate cuts, that will hurt the performance of utility 
stocks, Worms said. 
His top pick is Calpine, even though shares of the San Jose-based energy 
generator and marketer already have had an amazing two-year run, up 200% so 
far this year, on top of a 400% surge in 1999.

INDIA: Enron India unit local lenders to cut rates.

12/12/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

BOMBAY, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of U.S. energy giant Enron said on 
Tuesday that four local lenders have agreed to cut their rates on loans to 
its project which is under fire from critics for producing costly power. 
ICICI , Canara Bank, State Bank of India and Industrial Finance Corporation 
of India have all agreed to cut rates by 450 basis points to 16.5 percent, a 
spokesman of Dabhol Power Company told Reuters.
Dabhol Power Company is 65 percent owned by Enron and is implementing a 
two-phase 2,184 MW power project in Maharashtra. Phase one of the project is 
already in operation. 
The cuts will help in lowering the tariff at which Enron sells power to the 
Maharashtra government, he said. 
The spokesman said the firm is considering a reduction in tariff but did not 
reveal details. 
Last week, Industrial Development Bank of India agreed to drop rates by a 
similar margin. 
The spokesman did not specify when the cuts by the financial institutions 
would come into effect. 
The state government wants the project to be reviewed but is yet to take a 
final view. 
Enron says the high tariff would come down next year when it switches over to 
the cheaper fuel of natural gas from naphtha. 
The project cost of $1.9 billion is financed 70 percent through debt. 
Enron's project is among the few foreign power projects to have begun 
operations since India opened up its power sector in 1992.

Three Firms to Sell Natural Gas Instead of Selling Products That Use It
Terry Maxon

12/12/2000
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: The Dallas Morning News - Texas
Copyright (C) 2000 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World 
Reporter (TM)

Here's how expensive natural gas has become: Three companies decided Monday 
they could make more money from selling their natural gas than from selling 
products using natural gas. 
Natural gas prices hit yet another all-time high Monday, closing at $9.413 
per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That 
represented an 83-cent increase from Friday's close, up 9.6 percent.
Two fertilizer manufacturers, Terra Industries Inc. and Mississippi Chemical 
Corp., said they were selling natural gas that normally would go to make 
nitrogen, ammonia or other products. 
And oil company Seneca Resources Corp. said gas normally used to boost heavy 
oil production in a California field would be sold instead. 
Jeff Shorter, vice president of TXU Energy Trading in Dallas, said he's not 
surprised to hear companies are selling their natural gas rather than using 
the gas to make their products. 
""I don't think that's the last of them either,"" Mr. Shorter said. 
He said he expects other companies to come to the same decision as Terra. 
There are a number of companies that have fully hedged their natural gas 
purchases at lower prices, and can make a profit that ""far exceeds"" what they 
can earn from selling their core business products, he said. 
He noted that the prices in spot markets Monday were even higher than in 
NYMEX trading. Gas for Midwest delivery ranged from $11 to $13 and $14, and 
New York gas was at $12 and higher. 
""Typically, in the winter time we have a great deal of volatility which you 
don't see in the futures market,"" Mr. Shorter said. 
Spot prices have been much higher in the West, where restricted natural gas 
supplies, shut-down generators and low levels of water for hydroelectric 
plants have contributed to skyrocketing electricity prices. 
Terra, based in Sioux City, Iowa, said it closed one of two ammonia plants in 
Verdigris, Okla., and its Blytheville, Ark., plant this month, so it could 
sell the natural gas used by those plants. It is profiting about $2 to $3 per 
MBtu on the gas it is reselling. 
""The natural gas price increase since our December requirements were 
purchased for Verdigris permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and 
generate higher gross profits than could be realized from selling the 
products manufactured with the natural gas,"" said Michael L. Bennett, Terra 
executive vice president and chief operating officer. 
On Nov. 30, Terra said it was closing its Beaumont plant because it couldn't 
make a profit at current gas prices. 
Terra said then that its production costs would exceed selling prices when 
natural gas prices climbed above $6. When the decision was announced Nov. 30, 
NYMEX gas prices closed at $6.673 an MBtu. Since then, the prices have risen 
nearly $3. 
Terra said it would re-evaluate the situation toward the end of December. 
Mississippi Chemical said it was selling all of its futures contracts for 
natural gas to lock in the current prices. It said it would post a $16 
million pre-tax gain by selling the gas contracts. 
The company's president and chief executive officer, Charles O. Dunn, said 
selling the natural gas was in Mississippi Chemical's ""best interests."" 
""We remain committed to the nitrogen business and our customers, but we also 
have to take advantage of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these 
challenging times,"" Mr. Dunn said. ""It is our belief that the current 
unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to be sustained during the 
intermediate term."" 
Seneca Resources, based in Buffalo, N.Y., said Monday it would sell the 
natural gas it had been using for its steam injection project at a California 
oil field. It expects to post a pre-tax profit of about $31,000 a month, it 
said. 
""In light of the current natural gas shortage in California, we felt it was 
important to curtail our steaming operations and allow that gas to be used to 
heat homes and generate electricity,"" Seneca president James Beck said. 
In at least one case, high electricity prices have induced a company to sell 
off the electricity for which it has contracted rather than continue 
operations. 
On Sunday, Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. said it would close its Pacific 
Northwest smelters until at least Oct. 1, 2001, and was selling the 
electricity those plants would have used. 
Although it must pay laid-off employees a portion of their salaries, the 
power sales from December alone will bring Kaiser $52 million. 
Mr. Shorter of TXU and Mark Palmer, spokesman for Houston energy company 
Enron Corp., said the arrival of cold weather and the sharply higher natural 
gas prices have brought more companies to their doors asking for help in 
managing their energy costs. 
""Volatility is good for us,"" Mr. Palmer said. 
Mr. Shorter said the price of natural gas has justified a switch from natural 
gas to fuel oil for a number of their customers. 
Supplies of natural gas have remained adequate, but companies that didn't 
prepare for winter energy costs will feel a financial hit, Mr. Shorter said. 
""You're going to see a real economic strain in a lot of geographic regions -- 
if not nationally -- on the economic viability of a lot of these companies"" 
that had no program to manage energy risks or had plans that were 
""ill-advised or improperly timed,"" he said. 
Terra senior vice president Mark Rosenbury said Monday the company will look 
at gas prices between Christmas and New Year's to see if it can profitably 
buy natural gas and reopen the shuttered plants. 
Mr. Rosenbury said he sees the current spike in natural gas prices as ""an 
aberration"" and expects prices to fall to historical norms of $2 to $3 fairly 
soon. 
""Maybe it's longer than I think. But the cost of finding, producing and 
selling natural gas doesn't command the price it's at today,"" he said.

Activate ''Year-In-Review'' Factsheet

12/12/2000
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 12, 2000--Activate emerged as a leading 
digital media services company, Webcasting a record number of live events and 
winning two industry awards to cap a year of dramatic growth. 
A majority-owned operating company of CMGI, Activate's business has grown 
15-30X across all key metrics, both in volume and scope of work. Over 8,000 
businesses employed Activate's broad range of digital media services, 
including production and distribution of online live and on-demand events for 
both business communications and consumer events. In addition, Activate 
experienced over 100 million streams in 2000.
""This has been quite a year for Activate,"" said Jeff Schrock, CEO and founder 
of Activate. ""We've been fortunate to be involved in this industry from the 
very beginning and it has been exciting to see the digital media explosion 
over the last year. Activate's goal continues to be providing our customers 
with high-quality, cost-effective digital media solutions and we were 
fortunate to end the year on a high note, receiving two industry awards from 
Computerworld and Network World for our network performance and service 
offerings."" 

Notable Activate milestones for 2000 include... 

NETWORK 

-- Recognizing the broadband evolution, Activate focused on key 
network innovations, including cell-based server architecture. 
Activate's advanced network boosts bandwidth efficiency, 
increasing the company's peak capacity and refining Activate's 
load balancing and caching techniques. These enhancements 
contributed to Activate's Blue Ribbon win in Network World's 
Streaming Media Review, beating Akamai, iBeam and Digital 
Island. 

-- Coordination and cross-connection with other content 
distribution networks (CDNs), including Mirror Image, Enron, 
Digital Island, and AT&T. These skills led to a significant 
role in MSN's multi-network Webcast of Madonna's London 
concert, which was produced by sister company Navisite. 

AUDIENCE REACH 

-- With over 40,000 Webcasts in 2000, Activate streamed more live 
events than any other service provider, including Akamai, 
iBeam and Digital Island. Live events ranged from concerts for 
the Backstreet Boys and corporate announcements for Compaq, 
Amway and Microsoft to Seattle Seahawks game Webcasts and a 
political rally for Ralph Nader. 

-- Activate experienced new peaks in bits-per-second simultaneous 
transmission, total simultaneous viewers and total bytes 
transferred. These peaks resulted from combined audiences of 
hundreds of simultaneous events during Activate's highest 
traffic periods, averaging over 25 million streams per 
quarter. 

-- Acknowledging the impact of the World Wide Web, Activate 
partnered with European streaming media provider Unit.net to 
ensure global reach. 

BUSINESS EXPANSION 

-- Activate expanded into a 60,000 square foot production and 
operations center in Seattle, and additional operational and 
sales locations in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, 
Boston and Chicago. This growth complements the continued 
growth of Toronto-based Activate Canada, the leading streaming 
media provider in the Canadian market. 

INDUSTRY REACH 

-- Financial: Since Regulation FD went into effect, Activate 
established a 75 percent market share in the financial space, 
broadcasting nearly 4,000 earnings calls in the third quarter. 

-- Entertainment: Activate's digital media solutions were a 
breakthrough hit with the entertainment industry, including 
partnerships with BMG, MTVi and Miramax. From pop and rock to 
jazz and hip-hop, Activate provided digital media services for 
today's hottest artists including Jay-Z, P!NK and Christina 
Aguliera. 

-- Advertising: Activate partnered with AdForce and Engage to 
expand streaming advertising, developing live and on-demand ad 
insertion solutions.

These documents would be useful in the preparation for your upcoming 
presentation in Madrid. 

The Eurelectric trip to the US (including their visit to Enron building in 
Houston) has been rather fruitful - attched is the report Eurelectric 
delegates put together upon their return from States and the slides from the 
presentation they made in Brussels for the Commission and Members of the 
European Parliament. Also attached is the memorandum from the European 
Commission on the Californian crisis. The bottomline message is that 
liberalisation process is not to be blamed for what happened in CA but rather 
a set of very complex conditions. Also, the Commission tried to highlight 
that a similar situation is highly unlikely to be reproduced in the European 
Member States.

1486,"Hi Steve,
Folks love Newsome, and I think he's very nice and appears to be very
free market.  Spears, the other Republican appointee is not at all free
market, in my view.  I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I
have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but
are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person
on board.  And there are no truly free market persons on  board at the
Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the
Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and
they were far worse before I got there and after I left.)
I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at
what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have
elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at
the agency.  Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how
organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency.
I am often at odds with ""the industry view"" regarding CFTC issues.  I
don't think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are
pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues
are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken
at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more
interested in being able to claim influence or impact.  The CFTC is in awful
shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on
some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley
Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market
for years).  Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's
been such a backwater.  I am looking for some good folks.  Have  at least one
person who would be good at that job.  And it's not Newsome.  Please do not
share this information with the usual folks, as they hate me anyway (I'm too
free market and have argued against their ""fixes"").  Sorry for this scathing
review, but this is an important appointment.  Wendy","Steve Newsome Ken

","Ken Lay Jim John
",,
1489,"Steve, Jeff, and others: .

Here are some of my thoughts:

Power price strip.  The power prices pulled together from the Davis-Lay 
meeting are based on a weighted average of off- and on-peak prices.  We can 
easily show on- and off-peak prices  separately.  We're making a FERC filing 
on Tues showing l-t prices so we can pull peak/off peak from that data.  
Note, however, that ""baseload"" power is equivalent to 24x7x365 power, which 
is what we provided him.

In terms of my other reactions:

Not enough DSM.  The best analysis of the West trading desk is that we are in 
a temporary, WSCC-wide energy shortage, not a capacity shortage.  Anything 
that reduces kWh demand will leave more water behind dams and natural gas 
storage.  This will translate into lower market prices.  Until more natural 
gas supply, generating capacity, and rainfall comes along, we will see high 
prices.  If Davis is unwilling to raise rates, he should be willing to take 
some extraordinary measures to cut demand.  At a minimum, there should be 
expanded pay-for-curtailment curtailment programs.

Voluntary Opt Out of Rate Freeze  I have not thought through all the EES 
implications but one thing that could be ""sold"" to customers is to give them 
the option of buying an interval meter and pay the current market price of 
power.  That would empower them to modify demand and not incur ongoing, 
increasing stranded cost liability.

Muni's need to get involved.  I assume that Enron won't take a position on 
requiring muni's to sell generation in California but Enron should support 
having muni's be cajoled to participate in demand reduction programs for the 
reasons noted above.  As recently as 12/23 Freeman said there was no need to 
conserve at LADWP.  Pretty irresponsible.

Tie Govt Backings with Move to Cost-Based Prices.  Securitization and state 
credit guarantees are great ways to lower the cost of money to the utilties 
in this crisis.  However, both are irresponsible actions unless there is  a 
plan to move retail rates to a level that covers the full cost of power.

1494,"Jim,

 I have added my comments to your draft.  My concern with the ""Adopt PJM"" 
approach is that it will become a fiat accompli with regard to congestion 
management. and the nature of future transmission rights.  Once adopted as 
the standard, nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized 
approach is highly unlikely.  Unlike the British, we have a hard time 
changing horses because of our multi-jurisdictional Federal system of 
government.

 The PJM's lack of a secondary FTR market is more that just an allocation 
problem.  If that were true, they New York would have a secondary market -- 
none exists there either.  The unpredictability of prices is probably the 
biggest problem since no one knows how to value FTRs or TCCs.  I think the 
nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful.

 During our discussion of Seabron Adamson's last draft, I maintained that a 
centralized unit commitment process didn't fit the Pacific Northwest (PNW) 
with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectric and 
thermoelectric generation.  You asked me to provide more detail hydro-thermal 
operation.  I am including a paper that covers the nature of PNW operations 
and contracting with observations about the nature of unit commitment.  Given 
other work and travel, it has taken some time to complete the paper and its 
examples.  I hope this will help to explain why I am hesitant to endorse a 
centralize unit commitment implementation.

1496,"Jeff --

Our Internal Communications group is continuing to look for ways to 
communicate with employees in a timely manner about hot topics that are of 
interest to them.  We're also looking to increase your exposure with 
employees.  We have a new idea, which Sherri discussed briefly with you a 
couple of weeks ago.  It's called ""Jeff's Corner"" and it will be a regular 
video message that will be posted on the intranet -- which can be accessed by 
99.9% of our employees.  

This is how it will work.  We will tape a 2-3 minute video of you talking 
about what's top of mind at that moment.  The tone and style will be like 
your floor meetings (one of your best employee venues), casual and 
conversational.  We suggest the first topic be ""The State of Enron.""  There 
is a lot of talk among employees about the cheap shots we've taken as a 
company and by you and Ken, about the decline in our stock price and about 
the widespread re-deployment efforts.   These recent events are  beginning to 
affect morale.  Employees are concerned and want to be assured that we're on 
the right side, that they will have jobs, that Enron will be here next year.  
You've helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings; 
however, that is only a small part of our global work force.  Having your own 
corner on the intranet will have a farther reach, and we have the capability 
to do this in-house at very low cost.  

We recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly, 
although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time, you could 
even tape a message to employees weekly.  The nice thing about this medium is 
we have the ability to respond immediately to current events, and having you 
speak to employees gives the message credibility.  

Future topics could address new cost saving procedures, update on Dabhol, the 
PRC, reasons behind an organizational announcement, The Pulse survey, etc.  
We'd like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics you'd like to 
discuss.

I've checked with the technical team, and we have the capability do this 
now.  I will check your calendar with Sherri.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

appear ready to move H.R. 4941, Congressman Wynn's stand-alone reliability 
legislation; a large group of stakeholders would sign and send the attached 
letter.  Although Enron would like the letter to be stronger, this letter 
went through many revisions to reach the consensus language necessary for a 
larger group to sign.  Thus, while not a perfect letter, it would send a 
stronger message with a multitude of signatures.

The status of the letter is that it is being ""held in our back pocket"" should 
it become necessary.  Pre-approval has been given and it stands in an 
""almost"" final form.  Should you have any grave problems with the letter, let 
me know, and I will see what's possible given the constraints posed by the 
group.  

On a separate but related note, we are working with Joe and Dan to prepare a 
short white paper to detail the ""technical problems"" still remaining with the 
Wynn legislative language and will communicate these problems, Enron's 
opposition and lack of bill ""consensus"" to the Hill shortly (as soon as this 
paper is ready.)  I believe ELCON, EPSA and CMA will continue to share our 
opposition although confusion remains on the Hill as to the exact reasons for 
our opposition given the numerous versions of the legislation circulating.

interested in meeting with Richardson and also serving on the panel.  He was 
surprised by  Enron's concern that things were getting bogged down because 
his impression was that progress was being made.  He also had no problem with 
either NERC or GISB participation and felt that NERC has been fairly 
sympathetic to NASUCA.  With respect to some of the consumer issues, there is 
a fear that a national standard will weaken gains made in individual states 
that are more progressive than the national standard might be.  Finally, he 
suggested that a list be made of the technical versus policy (Consumer) 
issues so that we can at least try and move on the technical issues.  I 
suggested that I would have you call to clarify the details on the issues 
that Enron believes are not being addressed fast enough.  Overall, I would 
characterize Larry as very supportive of getting things done quickly, but 
concerned about protecting the consumer interests in the process.  (Right of

1510,"Wholesale electric prices soar anew 
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer 
(Published Dec. 13, 2000)

With wholesale prices again soaring on California's biggest power-trading 
market, grid operators called the year's 30th ""stage two"" electric emergency 
Tuesday. 
One consumer group estimated that if those prices continued and were passed 
along to ratepayers, the average Californian's electric bill would be $620 in 
December. 
Electric rates are currently frozen, although Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
and Southern California Edison are fighting in federal court and before the 
state Public Utilities Commission to end the freeze and pass along their 
costs. 
Although prices reached $1,500 a megawatt-hour Tuesday on the California 
Power Exchange, where most of the state's electricity is traded, problems 
with new trading rules drove the average price much lower. 
The issue, which revolves around how prices should be revised to reflect 
space crunches on transmission lines, is fueling anxiety between two 
California power agencies, the PX and the Independent System Operator, which 
runs the transmission grid. 
On Tuesday, the glitch produced two sets of prices -- an average of $1,182 a 
megawatt-hour before the transmission calculations dropped it to $258. 
One year ago, the average PX price was about $30. 
The issue is expected to simmer at least until Friday, when the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission will consider the state's electricity chaos. 
Meanwhile, Tuesday's wholesale costs fueled more calls to re-regulate 
electricity. 
""The prices that we're seeing are so out of whack ... it's just obscene,"" 
said Doug Heller, a consumer advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and 
Consumer Rights, which promises a 2002 ballot initiative on the issue. 
As the ISO declared a ""stage two"" emergency Tuesday and called for continuing 
efforts to conserve electricity, the agency's chief operating officer, Kellan 
Fluckiger, predicted that more power could soon be available. 
Power plants capable of generating 1,000 to 1,500 megawatts are expected back 
on line by the end of the week, Fluckiger said. 
By week's end, only about 7,000 megawatts of capacity might be off line, he 
said, compared with 11,000 megawatts last week.

USA: Cinergy to buy two power plants from Enron.

12/12/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Cinergy Corp. said Tuesday its non-regulated 
unit, Cinergy Capital & Trading Inc., would purchase two natural gas-fired 
power plants from Enron Corp. . 
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
The two Enron units, the 494-megawatt (MW) Brownsville generating facility in 
Tennessee and the 504-MW Caledonia plant in Mississippi, would increase 
Cinergy's generation portfolio owned, operated, or under construction, to 
about 21,000 MW, Cinergy said in a statement Tuesday. 
The Brownsville facility has four natural gas-fired combustion turbines, 
while the Caledonia facility has six. 
Both stations began operation in June 1999. They are located in the 
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC) and are interconnected to 
the Tennessee Valley Authority's transmission system, the statement said. 
The acquisition is subject to approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC), as well as other regulators, and is expected to be 
completed by the spring of 2001, Cinergy said. 
Cinergy Capital & Trading is an energy marketing and project development 
affiliate of Cincinnati, Ohio-based Cinergy Corp. Cinergy's largest operating 
companies, Cincinnati Gas and Electric Co. and PSI Energy Inc. provide 
electricity to more than 1.4 million customers in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky.

CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 12, 2000--Cinergy Corp. (NYSE:CIN) today 
announced that Cinergy Capital & Trading, Inc. (CCT), a non-regulated 
affiliate of Cinergy Corp, and Enron North America have signed a definitive 
agreement under which CCT will purchase two natural gas-fired merchant 
electric generating facilities located in the southeastern United States. 
The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cinergy's earnings in 2001. 
Financial terms were not disclosed. Also, the transaction will increase 
Cinergy's generation portfolio to about 21,000 megawatts (net owned, operated 
or under development) with the non-regulated portion being approximately 
15,000 megawatts.
""This acquisition in combination with our recently deregulated Ohio 
generation and the peaking capacity added early this year creates for Cinergy 
a significant and balanced generation portfolio of baseload and peaking 
capacity,"" said James E. Rogers, president and CEO of Cinergy Corp. 
""Importantly, these facilities can serve our large long-term customers in the 
Southeast, which is among the fastest growing areas in the country, as well 
as our Midwest customers."" 
The acquisition consists of Enron's 494-megawatt Brownsville generation 
facility located in Haywood County, Tennessee and the 504-megawatt Caledonia 
generation facility located in Lowndes County, Mississippi. Brownsville has 
four natural gas-fired combustion turbines and Caledonia has six. Both 
stations entered into service in June 1999. Both facilities are located in 
the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC) region and are 
interconnected to the Tennessee Valley Authority's transmission system. 
""Cinergy has created a regional leadership position in the Midwest power 
market and is focused on strategic opportunities to expand our footprint,"" 
said Michael J. Cyrus, president of Cinergy Capital & Trading. ""With this 
transaction we will have added approximately 1,700 megawatts in the eastern 
interconnect and increased our non-regulated generating capacity in excess of 
30 percent in just over a year. It is indicative of our continued commitment 
to the growth and value of a balanced energy merchant business."" 
The completion of the acquisition is subject to, among other things, receipt 
of approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and expiration of the 
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 
1976. Cinergy currently expects that regulatory approvals would be obtained 
and the transaction will close in Spring 2001. 
Cinergy Capital & Trading, Inc. is a non-regulated energy marketing and 
project development affiliate of Cinergy Corp., one of the nation's leading 
diversified energy companies, with a total enterprise value of $8.5 billion 
and assets of $10 billion. In addition to its generation portfolio, it also 
has 55,000 miles of electric and gas transmission lines in the United States 
and abroad and approximately 9,000 employees in nine countries. Its largest 
operating companies, The Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company and PSI Energy, 
Inc., serve more than 1.4 million electric customers and 478,000 gas 
customers in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. 
Cinergy is active in U.S. power and natural gas markets and maintains a

total U.S. energy consumption. In 1998 the New York Mercantile Exchange 
selected Cinergy to be its transmission hub for Midwest electricity futures 
trading, which has become the most active hub in the United States. 
In addition to its U.S. operations, Cinergy owns and operates power

1533,"Attached are more articles that speak of the current California power crisis.

Mercury News Article primarily dealing with Governor Davis' view on the 
situation and what he is doing to help solve the issue. Davis has a three 
part plan: investigate price gouging, ask PUC to set up two-year plan to cut 
rates in half and asked for voluntary conservation. 

Asking Clinton to speed up a federal probe of apparent electricity 
price-gouging by out-of-state power producers and called on state regulators; 
A spokesman for the independent energy producers said his group welcomed a 
federal investigation, saying it would determine that ``California simply 
does not have enough generating and transmission capacity.'' 
To stabilize skyrocketing utility bills in San Diego; Davis called upon the 
Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday to set up a two-year plan to cut 
rates nearly in half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas 
& Electric.  Davis described his proposal as ``a rate-stabilization plan'' 
designed to lower bills. ;Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility 
Reform Network, a consumer group, criticized Davis' plan. She said consumer 
groups want the Legislature to freeze rates in San Diego at July 1999 levels. 
Volunary actions: Davis joined with grocers to announce a voluntary program 
to conserve power on extremely hot days, meaning lights in Bay Area 
supermarkets would be dimmed and air conditioning dials set higher to cut 
power use by 10 percent. 
Davis contends that deregulation will work out, perhaps in three or four 
years, when a dozen or more power plants in the pipeline start generating 
electricity. 



Mercury News article states it is not time to re-regulate the markets and 
provides the following solutions to solve the crisis.
Matters will improve when California has: 
-> More sources of power. 
-> A more sophisticated electricity market. 
-> Smarter consumers -- that is, consumers with the information they need to 
be thrifty. 
Also the article talks of the Power Exchange (PX) and the Independent System 
Operators (ISO) and how these two groups are making the prices higher; i.e 
market imperfections that result from the uniqueness of electricity as a 
commodity and the immaturity of the new exchanges are enabling producers to 
obtain higher prices than the underlying conditions dictate. 
Article concludes by saying the deregulated market is just beginning and with 
a few adjustments will work out fine


Mercury News article speaking of a new report commissioned by Governor Davis 
on the energy crisis. The article is primarily about the following issues.
A report commissioned by Gov. Gray Davis concluded that deregulation is ``not 
working,'' and recommended a series of actions, including asking the federal 
government to help control prices. 
The report was written by the president of the California Public Utilities 
Commission and the chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board and 
made 30 recommendations to help ease the threat of power shortages and price 
spikes. 
Report suggested that  the state-mandated freeze on utility rates, which is 
tentatively in place for PG&E customers through March 2002, might need to be 
extended further. 
The report also suggested the upgrading power transmission lines into San 
Francisco and  hooking up businesses to a central command center via the 
Internet, so their lobby lights and air conditioning could be turned off 
automatically when state power supplies were low. 
Two key state agencies, the Independent System Operator and the Power 
Exchange, were criticized in the report. It accused the ISO and the Power 
Exchangeof being unresponsive to the needs of consumers, in part because 
their boards include people with ties to power companies. It also complained 
that they did not provide key pricing and other data requested by the 
report's authors to assess the state's energy problems.
Also in the article is a repsonse by the ISO and PX to the claims made in the 
governor's report.

1537,"As I mentioned earlier to Mark, Jeff Girth of the NYT again today contacted 
Lee Sachs about Enron.  You recall Lee was Asst Secretary of Treasury for 
Financial Markets during the Clinton Administration.  From his conversation, 
Lee reports the following items were raised by Girth:  a) the state of energy 
trading products and investment climate; b)  Enron's role in this market; c) 
whether and how financial energy products drive pricing and supply of 
physical energy products (Lee told him emphatically no); and, c) whether 
government regulators understand these issues.  Lee said this is clearly an 
Enron specific story.  Lee thinks Girth came away from the conversation with 
more of a right perspective (namely that these are important markets and that 
we play a vital role).  Lee said that Girth was less focussed on passage of 
the CEA and the politics than Girth had been in an earlier conversation; 
almost all  of today's conversation was forward looking.  Girth told Lee that 
he had not told Lee ""all"" that is behind this story, but did say that there 
is an interesting twist (Lee thinks Girth perhaps something specific either 
on a document front or source).   Lee gave Girth a list of experts to talk to 
who are unbiased but clearly right thinking on the subject.  Lee suggested 
that Girth to:  Pat Parkinson at the Fed (the godfather of the ""hands off"" 
regulatory perspective for the OTC market), Bill Rainer, and Ed Rosen (a 
prominent attorney in NY).  Lee expects Girth to keep calling him.  ",Mark Jeff Girth Lee Girth Pat Parkinson Bill Rainer Ed Rosen,,NYT Lee Sachs Enron Treasury the Clinton Administration Fed

		Democrats Mistook Static for  Votes 
		Robert Blohm - Princeton, New Jersey 
		
		Last Saturday's Miami-Dade court-recount, under a strict standard,  
reportedly favored George W. Bush. In other words the higher quality the  
vote, the relative greater likelihood it was for Mr. Bush. This accords  with 
testimony a week earlier before Judge Sauls by Gore's Quebec  statistician, 
Nicholas Hengartner. He depicted that ""new"" votes  ""recovered"" in the Broward 
County manual recount of rejected ballots were,  even under that county's 
less strict standard, biased toward Mr. Bush  relative to the votes before 
the manual recount: Mr. Bush had 34% of the  new (i.e. ""recovered"") votes, 
versus 31% of the votes before the manual  recount. 
		
		The three Florida Supreme Court wise men last Friday  fixed on two tradeoffs: 
speed vs. accuracy, and (higher) margin of error  vs. (lower) margin of 
victory. When it's hopeless to pin down an exact  number, the trend becomes 
everything. And the trend, the stricter the  standard, has been toward Mr. 
Bush. 
		
		You had to include overvotes  in any statewide recount, which includes 
optical ballots as well as  punch-card ballots. While punch ballots have a 
higher undervote rate than  optical ballots, it's the reverse with overvotes. 
Why? If you only touch  both candidates' spots with the stylus (leaving no 
mark) or a pencil  (leaving a mark), what registers as an undervote on a 
punch ballot  registers as an overvote on an optical ballot. 
		
		Undervotes can be  non-votes, or low-quality votes which may vary in quality 
with the voter's  mental ability. There is a level of mental ability below 
which voting  behavior is noise, unintelligible, unpurposeful. The issue was 
where you  set the cut-off point, and ignore incompetence. 
		
		The Democratic  Party has a practice of assigning no cut-off point, as if 
rounding up  derelicts to cast meaningless votes. It's as if Mr. Gore was 
trying to get  elected by assigning purposefulness to incompetents, in the 
face of  evidence that competence was biasing votes toward Mr. Bush.

1551,"EPA and TVA have been negotiating for some time over possible settlements in 
enforcement actions filed by EPA over modifications made to TVA power plants 
in violation of New Source Review (NSR) rules.  Those negotiations to reach 
an out-of-court solution have officially broken down, with TVA filing a 
petition in federal court late yesterday opposing EPA's NSR enforcement 
allegations.

While many felt TVA might settle with EPA (since it was government 
negotiating with government), TVA has taken a very strong stance, indicating 
that they made some offers to EPA but that EPA's unreasonable stance would 
cause severe harm to grid reliability, the financial viability of TVA and 
pocketbooks of the ratepayers.   Southern Company and Duke Energy filed 
petitions supporting TVA.   

EPA is insisting that these court filings will in no way stop the Agency from 
pursuing NSR enforcement measures.

1552,"I met with Sally Painter to discuss our Gore 2000 strategy.  From this 
meeting, Sally drafted the attached action plan with the following near-term 
action items:

1) She suggests that we draft 1-2 page issue briefs on our signature policy 
issues.  I suggested 4 policy areas on which Enron has unique experience:  
electricity deregulation, e-commerce (trading), energy services, and 
broadband.  We spoke about this at a DC staff meeting and we set a mid-June 
deadline for the completion of these papers...of course with input from all.

2) We have set June 13 as the date for the Enron business outreach dinner.  
We need to decide if we want to do it in DC or Houston.  We also need to 
decide if we want to bring in our colleagues from different companies or 
associations to attend this dinner.  Sally suggested we try to bring in 8-10 
senior executives from our industry(ies).  

3) We need to set a date to go to Gore 2000 in Nashville to meet the

As you requested, attached please find the Analyst compensation comparables 
we discussed last week:



We are having an extremely tough time recruiting Analysts from Rice because 
our main competition on campus comes from consulting companies (Bain, 
McKinsey, BCG, EY, Andersen, etc.) and investment banks (Goldman, JP Morgan, 
CSFB, Merrill Lynch, etc.).  Even though these companies are not directly in 
our industry group, they are our principal competitors for talent at Rice.  

As evidenced by our recruiting performance this year and in previous years, 
we loose nearly every time when we compete with these companies.    In the 
last three years of recruiting at Rice, only 1 or 2 people have accepted our 
offer.  The other Analysts who are rice alumni (myself included) joined Enron 
through other circumstances.

I think our poor performance at Rice is due primarily to the following 
factors:

Compensation:  The Enron compensation package  is below that of our 
competitors at Rice.  Additionally, there is more risk associated with our 
offer, since Enron's compensation structure relies more heavily on the year 
end bonus than some of our competitors.  In the cases where the package is 
similar (ie, McKinsey), we loose folks because of other company's name and 
prestige.
Rotations:  Most investment banks give their analysts offers to work in 
specific groups (M&A, Trading, Etc.).  Our analyst recruits can express a 
preference, but their placement is not guaranteed.    This also creates an 
added element of risk and uncertainty.

In sum, I think we will continue to be unsuccessful in our recruiting efforts 
at Rice if we do not address these issues.

Should you need any further information, please feel free to contact me.

1559,"Hi Steve,
Folks love Newsome, and I think he's very nice and appears to be very
free market.  Spears, the other Republican appointee is not at all free
market, in my view.  I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I
have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but
are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person
on board.  And there are no truly free market persons on  board at the
Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the
Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and
they were far worse before I got there and after I left.)
I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at
what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have
elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at
the agency.  Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how
organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency.
I am often at odds with ""the industry view"" regarding CFTC issues.  I
don't think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are
pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues
are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken
at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more
interested in being able to claim influence or impact.  The CFTC is in awful
shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on
some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley
Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market
for years).  Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's
been such a backwater.  I am looking for some good folks.  Have  at least one
person who would be good at that job.  And it's not Newsome.  Please do not
share this information with the usual folks, as they hate me anyway (I'm too

that you sent through.

Broadly, the presentation is designed to provide an international perspective 
to the liberalization of electricity markets, in the context of the Japanese 
emerging markets. As you are aware, the conference coincides with the public 
release of the Brattle paper commissioned by Enron Japan which makes specific 
recommendations for electricity sector reform in Japan. 

The notes accompanying the slides are intended to provide a Japanese context 
to international examples. We have added an advertisement of Enron Japan 
towards the end of the presentation which is styled as a practical example of 
the new energy company. Its purpose is to start the process of shifting the 
public focus on Enron Japan away from energy wholesaling.

The speaking time is 50minutes. The audience will be middle to senior 
management from utilities, large-lot users, METI, the US Government, 
consultants and others. The press will be attending.

I will provide a briefing note on the conference shortly.

I would welcome your comments. I will try to catch you Wednesday afternoon

1573,"About 1 AM this morning, the Legislature adjourned -- the Senate without voting out the Edison MOU (which included DA provisions) and the Assembly without passing out Bowen's green DA bill. 
On the SCE MOU, Governor Davis responded by saying 1) the Assembly did a good job, 2) the Senate failed to do its job and 3) Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU. The special session would begin in about 2 weeks. 
Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldn't take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim.
The CPUC is scheduled to take up its vote to suspend DA on Thursday, Sept 20.

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION

Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed
to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win
approval in the California State Senate.

""I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the
business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness.
Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

""It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

""I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in
approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has
assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its
creditors will continue to show restraint.""

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility 
JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer

(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 
The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. 
As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. 
But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. 
""We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor,"" said President Pro Tem John Burton. ""It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation."" 
The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. 
Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. 
The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. 
""I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness,"" Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. ""Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done."" 
The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. 
The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. 
It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. 
While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. 
Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. 
The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. 
The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. 
""Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance,"" said Davis.

1574,"We're getting a lot of inquiries about Enron's role in California's de-reg 
history, with a lot of misinformation arising out of Peace's handywork.  

I spent about 3 hours on Friday with a Sac Bee reporter (Dale Kasler).  He'll 
be interviewing Skilling on the same topic in a week or so, and he'd like to 
talk to Steve, too.  

Sue spent time with a NYT reporter discussing the same. Some common themes 
are arising in the questions.  Thought it would be a good idea to spend 30 
minutes discussing those themes and developing our messages to ensure 
consistency.  If folks think it would be useful, is there a time this week 
that we could squeeze in 30 minutes?  Thanks.

Background:  The Cal ISO acts as the ""air traffic controller"" for the 
interstate electric power grid in California.  The ISO determines who gets 
access to the grid and under what terms and conditions.  It is the ISO that 
helps ensure that access to the grid is truly open and non-discriminatory.

interests",Joshua,,"Enron the Oregon PUC Q&A EPSA the Management of the California

Thank you for your call on Friday.  I appreciated the opportunity to speak to 
you openly.  It has been a bumpy ride here in DC since the summer, but the 
turbulence has subsided and our new pilot has brought us to terra firma.

I can't say enough good things about the leadership Linda brings to this 
office.  Compassionate and wise, she's able to sort through mountains of 
information and prioritize.  She's effective at bringing people together and 
our new open office space facilitates better communication.  She hosted a 
happy hour after work on Friday for the entire team and invited some of 
Bracewell's people for good measure.  

It is wise strategy to bring John Hardy and his team into Federal Government 
Affairs.  John's intimate knowledge of our key international projects and his 
astute political skills make him a valuable asset to the team.  He works well 
with Tom Briggs and I believe together they can pull the international issues 
together.

These and other changes are good news for the DC office.  In addition, as 
Chief of Staff I commend you for the much needed changes in our accounting 
system (XMS), the upgrade to our software, and our wonderful new computers.  
A sincere thank you!!

As always, your behind the scenes people -- Maureen, Ginger, Elizabeth 
Linnell and her team -- are supportive and respond quickly to requests.  I 
can't say enough about these highly intelligent, dedicated individuals who 
certainly make my life easier in Washington.

Steve, please feel free to call upon me anytime.  I value your support, as 
ever.

1597,"Below are details of new plan currently being created by California State 
Treasurer Phil Angelides and supported by Sen. Burton.  The plan is in the 
initial stages and is not currently on any legislative fast-track.  It is 
also not motivated by a desire to save SoCal from bankruptcy.  The creator's 
goal is to give Californians more control over their energy and electric 
futures as well as giving the tax/rate payers a share of the pie in return 
for money that has/will go to the utilities.  We will continue to monitor 
this plan, its supporters and progress.

Plan Z
  California State Treasurer Phil Angelides and a powerful group of 
legislators are finally taking action and are developing a plan to solve 
California's energy crisis this summer.  The group is comprised of leftish 
legislators, environmental advocates, in-state energy company executives and 
business leaders and they are pulling together a Plan Z.  At the core of the 
plan is the recently passed authorization to erect a California Public Power 
Authority that issues bonds, constructs new power plants and buys up 
transmission lines.  There is even talk within this group of using newly 
legislated authority to buy SoCal Edison for $3.5 billion (less than it owes) 
although they would face huge obstacles and receive strong opposition from 
power companies as well as Edison itself.
  The five-year goal is to have enough power generation capacity to guarantee 
a 5%-15% ""cushion"" against energy peak demand.  Angelides and Burton want to 
create enough capacity to form a buyer's market.  One of the points of the 
plan is to replace private sector generation with more public sector 
generation.  This plan may short-circuit private sector plans to build new 
plants, but the state has the ability to issue $5B in revenue-backed bonds 
(in addition to the $12B rate-backed bonds).    The second key element in the 
Angelides-Burton Plan Z is additional rate hikes for California's consumers 
and businesses.  Although discussions are still underway between this group 
and business leaders, Angelides is wanting to propose an additional 45% 
increase in residential and commercial electricity rates, however, there is 
immense sympathy for loading a disproportionate share of the burden on 
businesses.   This increase is on top of the 50%-60% already mandated by 
previous PUC decisions this year.  These rate increases will do two things: 
stop the immediate fiscal drain on the state of California and prevent 
emergency tax hikes (being serious considered last week).  
  Issues to consider in regards to this plan are: (1) how much will current 
shareholders be diluted in return for helping the utilities repay long-owed 
debts (or what would they get if the state decided to buy up all of SoCal 
Edison); and (2) how much will creditors have to ""eat"" in the legislated 
repayment plan?   In other words how big will the equity and bond haircuts 
be?  There is no answer to these questions right now as legislators work to 
cobble together a plan with numbers that work without triggering a massive 
and politically destructive rebellion by voters next year.",Phil Angelides Burton Angelides 50%-60,$3.5 billion 5B,SoCal SoCal Edison Edison Angelides-Burton Plan Z PUC
1598,"The Hearings
The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like 
environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility 
witnesses.
The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship.
The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E 
witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices 
since restructuring started in 1998.
Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for 
investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g., 
dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and 
parent's use of that cash for investment activities).  
Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the 
utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from 
parent, bankruptcy).
The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward 
PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings 
progress.
Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by 
Edison witness.
Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to 
issue its decision on Thursday.
At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed 
the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general 
ratemaking authority.

Outside the Hearing
Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management 
continue.
Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities 
inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain 
some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room.
Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with 
utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any 
rate increases.
Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission 
absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor 
follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of 
the state speech on the 8th.",,,PG&E ALJ Commission the Commission/Administration

For an interim period, FERC will deal with pending requests for market based rates and with triennial reviews of those rate authorizations, using a new test called the ""Supply Margin Assessment"" (also called a jazzed up version of the hub and spoke test) where a seller's capacity will be reviewed against the generation reserve margin in a market.  The test takes into account constraints based on TTC.  If the capacity of a seller is not necessary to meet peak demand,the seller does not have market power.  This test is applicable to all markets that are not part of an existing RTO or ISO.  For those selling into an RTO/ISO, the FERC will continue to allow market based rates subject to the market monitor and mitigation.  

Staff also recommends that FERC initiate a Section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner, the FERC can require refunds.  Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.

Last, for the long-term, FERC will hold outreach meetings looking for answers as to how to detect market power and what to do when it is detected.  

Since the interim measure is only a ""snapshot"" approach according to Commissioner Massey, he is willing to support it only along with the above described tariff provision.

Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To $6.1B From $8.9B     
Updated: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 11:53 AM ET      
 

By Mark Golden 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 


NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's estimate of how much the state was overcharged by power suppliers dropped to $6.1 billion from $8.9 billion when an adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge was taken into account, according to data submitted to FERC last week. 

The California Independent System Operator's estimate fell when the grid operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview, and its estimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by the judge following the conclusion of 15 days of talks between power suppliers and the state over potential refunds last week. 

Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate, however, the state is sticking to the original $8.9 billion figure, which has been called arbitrary by critics. The $6.1 billion estimate merely establishes ""a potential framework for settlement discussions,"" Eric Hildebrandt, the ISO's chief analyst on the matter, told the FERC. 

FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner, who has dismissed the $8.9 billion figure as baseless and criticized California's delegation for not negotiating in good faith, estimated in his report on the talks that refunds due may amount to about $1 billion. Power suppliers offered just over $700 million. 

Wagner has recommended FERC hold a 60-day hearing to set the level of refunds and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed. 

The ISO's original $8.9 billion figure included electricity sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didn't go through the ISO's wholesale markets, the California Power Exchange or the California Department of Water Resources. Without direct knowledge of the prices of those purchases, the ISO made estimates. 

""We know the volume (of the bilateral deals),"" Hildebrandt said. ""The refund amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market."" 


Resetting The Baseline 


Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the ISO and CalPX markets - which were set up by the state's deregulation law for California's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power - in addition to sales to the California Department of Water Resources. 

The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January. DWR has also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 

In arriving at his new estimate, the ISO's Hildebrandt also recalculated fair prices - the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined - by retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June 19. Those controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generator needed to meet demand each hour. 

But last week, after Hildebrandt completed his $6.1 billion estimate, Wagner recommended to FERC commissioners that the June 19 price control formula be modified when used retroactively to determine refunds. 

Those modifications, if applied to the ISO's estimate, would cut refunds much further. For example, FERC's price limits are now based on a monthly average of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state. Wagner recommended using power producers' actual gas costs. Since gas is considerably more expensive in southern California, using actual prices would cut potential refunds sharply. 

Also, Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back as Oct. 2, which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about one-third, according to Hildebrandt's previous monthly breakdown. 

ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of Wagner's recommendations, but the ISO will still include sales back to May 2000, said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. 

""The reason we're not going back just to Oct. 2 is that all of the overcharges going back to May should be repaid,"" McCorkle said. ""We just maintain that position."" 


FERC Baseline Questioned 


In addition, Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERC's new formula, the price cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have been available, not the least efficient generator actually used to meet demand. 

That's because the FERC's new price controls require all available generators be made available to the ISO at any time, Hildebrandt said. 

Applying that rule would raise the ISO's revised estimate substantially: to $7.7 billion from $6.1 billion. 

One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher, Hildebrandt said, was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units. Considering only the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent the rewards for such withholding, he said. 

""The judge is in error to suggest that the actual (least-efficient) unit used would have been called on if the must-offer requirement were in effect,"" Hildebrandt said in an interview. 

In arriving at his estimate, Hildebrandt determined the difference between actual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and for every hour since May 1, 2000, had price controls been in effect. The ISO released only the total potential refund, not the company-specific shares. 

Hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained his numbers aren't justified. 

""These are based on very tangible records,"" he said. ""The idea that it's a black box is misleading.""

1609,"On 3/30/98, Aquila filed a complaint at FERC against Entergy that Entergy 
reserved all of the firm import capacity (2000 MW) at four key interfaces, 
even though Entergy did not designate any off-system network resources to 
cover these reservations.  Aquila's transmission requests were denied or 
curtailed causing it to suffer financial losses.  Entergy responded that 
Aquila had a ""fundamental misunderstanding"" of Order No. 888 et seq. and that 
a transmission provider may deny tariff requests, if that transmission 
provider's own reservations ""are based on the legitimate reliability needs"" 
of its bundled retail customers.

Reservation facts:  Entergy posted on its OASIS site that it reserved 2000 MW 
of capacity at its interfaces with TVA (1100 MW), Southern (400 MW), Arkansas 
Electric Coop (250 MW), and Union Electric (250 MW) under the label ""Firm 
Import for Native Load.""  Entergy did not designate network resources in the 
same manner that it required from Aquila and other network customers.  
Entergy explained that its reservations were needed ""to meet the immediate 
reliability needs of the Entergy System and to accommodate native load growth 
over the next few years.""  (Entergy later told FERC that this was needed for 
""current loads"" only--not future growth.)

Entergy argued to FERC that it is able to satisfy its generation reserve 
requirements, while maintaining lower amounts of generating capacity within 
its control area, only because it can rely on the 2000 MWs at issue to reach 
neighboring control areas, therefore this is ""a legitimate reliability 
need.""  Entergy then claimed that Sec. 28.2 of the pro forma tariff (that 
requires a transmission provider, on behalf of its Native Load Customers, to 
designate its network resources in the same manner as any Network Customer) 
does not apply to a utility's uses of its transmission system to serve 
bundled retail customers. 

In a draft order issued today, FERC disagreed with Entergy and found that 
Entergy reserved virtually all of the firm capacity on four key interfaces, 
even though it had no off-system network resources.  Instead, Entergy used 
its firm transmission reservation to purchase power whenever it was 
economical.  Entergy denied all other firm transmission requests and 
entertained non-firm transmission requests only when it was unable to make an 
economic deal for itself.  Even though Entergy is not required to take 
transmission under its tariff for retail load, it is required to designate 
network resources and loads.  The off-system resource must be generation 
owned by the transmission provider or under contract.  

Although FERC found that Entergy violated the OATT and normally the 
transmission should be released, Entergy has now begun to designate network 
resources (these new procedures are pending at FERC).  Aquila also asked FERC 
for its financial losses of $281,000, but FERC said it lacked authority to 
order money damages.  FERC would order refunds of the transmission rate, but 
Aquila did not allege that it paid for services it did not receive.

Interestingly, FERC told Aquila that it could bring this matter up in Entergy 
Power Marketing's currently pending 3 year update of its market-based rates 
stating that  use of the transmission system on a non-preferential basis is a 
fundamental condition for market-based rates.  (Entergy argued against this 
saying that there was no allegation that it had profited.  FERC rejected this 
argument.)  Dynegy has already protested Entergy's 3 year update stating that 
Entergy is exercising market power by limiting new generation through poor 
interconnection procedures and agreements.  Enron filed one sentence support 
of Dynegy's protest.  I think this is why Entergy recently filed its 
interconnection agreement and procedures at FERC.

Comm. Herbert dissented saying that this was a ""technically"" from several 
years ago.

Energy costs rocket, handing consumers biggest shock yet 



By Craig D. Rose 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
December 12, 2000 
Power prices in California keep hitting new heights, with prices in the 
state's main electricity market rising today to nearly $900 per megawatt 
hour. 
The rise continues a stunning ascent from a price of about $50 per megawatt 
hour as recently as last spring. In retail terms, today's prices -- if 
sustained for a month -- would result in an average residential power bill of 
more than $450. 
San Diego ratepayers are temporarily shielded from such high bills by a 
rate-deferral plan in effect at least until 2002. 






The latest prices represent a more than tripling in posted prices on the 
California Power Exchange since Friday, when the operator of the state power 
grid removed a state-mandated price cap of $250. 
The latest escalation -- which comes despite improvements yesterday in state 
power supplies -- is deepening the sense of crisis among state officials, 
consumer advocates and utility companies. 
Nonetheless, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, who met yesterday with top 
energy advisers in Los Angeles, said it was unlikely there would be action to 
address the crisis at the state level until after federal regulators release 
their plan for California. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to issue a final order 
regarding California's market at its meeting tomorrow. But yesterday the 
commission made plans for a second meeting Friday to deal with the state's 
problems, and did not clarify at which session it would issue the California 
order. 
Davis and others in the state have been critical of FERC's refusal to halt 
what they describe as a devastating rise in power prices here or to order 
refunds for payments made by consumers over the past summer. 
The governor also has been severely critical of the California Independent 
System Operator's decision to lift the state price cap last week. The ISO 
manages most of the state's power supply. 
Privately, most at the state level remain skeptical that federal action will 
ease the crisis, saying it will be up to California to fix the problem. Last 
Friday, FERC quickly approved the ISO's plan to end the price cap. 
Increasingly, state officials and consumer activists are talking about 
state-owned power systems, utility takeovers and a likely initiative seeking 
to overturn deregulation. SDG&E and others also emphasize the need for a 
price cap for the Western region of the United States, in order to prevent 
suppliers from migrating to the highest prices and driving prices upward 
everywhere. 
The new highs in electricity prices came even as the ISO said the state's 
supplies had improved, with the start-up of production from a formerly closed 
nuclear power plant unit. 
The apparent contradiction between the increase in available power and the 
continued price escalation was blamed on a number of factors: 
High prices for natural gas -- which fuels power plants -- continued to drive 
up the cost of generating electricity. Cold conditions in the Midwest helped 
push natural gas prices to record highs yesterday. 
Allegations also persist that energy companies have manipulated the market. 
Consumers Union and other advocacy groups say deregulating electricity prices 
has proven to be a costly error for California consumers. 
At the same time, the controversial removal of price caps in California is 
allowing prices to rise to levels approaching those in other Western states. 
""We've now had three days of the Hebert experiment,"" said state Sen. Steve 
Peace, D-El Cajon. Peace was referring to Curt Hebert, a FERC commissioner 
who opposes price caps for wholesale electricity. 
Peace, who played a prime role in California's deregulation legislation, 
likened the run-up in electricity prices to the oil embargo of the 1970s and 
warned that it could devastate the economy. 
""Someone from (former Gov. Pete) Wilson's administration told me, 'Somebody 
in the energy business decided it's time for a depression,'?"" said Peace, who 
has also been critical of FERC's failure to rein in prices. ""This is not 
about electricity. It's about the economy."" 
In a letter to FERC yesterday, Peace repeated earlier calls for a federal 
order returning the state to regulated power prices based on the cost of 
production. 
Market watchers said little could help the state over the next few days, 
except Mother Nature. 
""The prices will remain at these levels, unless you get a warming trend,"" 
said Alex Galatic of Strategic Energy, a Pittsburgh-based energy company with 
offices in Carlsbad. 
Market speculators appear to be betting against a break in price any time 
soon. For example, electricity is selling for $800 per megawatt hour in the 
Pacific Northwest for delivery in January, Galatic said. 
""I see no break in the pricing,"" agreed Arthur O'Donnell, editor of 
California Energy Markets,? a publication based in San Francisco. 
A spokesman for Enron Corp., the largest electricity trader in the United 
States, said the raising of prices in California had improved supplies 
available to the state. And he added that there was another positive aspect 
to the higher commodity prices. 
""You are starting to see some demand response,"" said Mark Palmer, the Enron 
spokesman, referring to cutbacks in power use as prices soar. ""Some companies 
are shutting down because it makes more sense to sell their gas (rather than 
using it as fuel to continue their manufacturing operations)."" 
That's not an option for the state's utility companies, which continue to 
report growing losses from buying electricity at higher costs than they can 
collect from their customers. They have covered the shortfall by borrowing 
money. 
Dow Jones Newswires reported that Pacific Gas & Electric was only ""weeks"" 
away from being unable to cover its power costs if prices continue at recent 
levels. 
A spokesman for the Bay Area utility's parent company declined to comment 
directly on the report. 
""It's up to the decision of creditors to make that call,"" said Greg Pruett, 
vice president of communications for PG&E. ""We have already borrowed $2.6 
billion to cover undercollections that have totaled $4.6 billion. 
""It can't continue forever."" 

Colombia's Medellin Utility Appeals Isagen Ruling, Paper Says
12/12/0 9:14 (New York)


     Bogota, Dec. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Colombia's largest municipal
utility, Empresas Publicas de Medellin, said it will appeal a high
court decision barring it from buying a majority stake in state-
run generator Isagen, the daily El Espectador reported.
     EPM general manager Ramiro Valencia said government plans to
sell its 76 percent stake in Isagen could not go ahead until the
appeal and other lawsuits filed by EPM are resolved, the report
said. Colombia in September suspended the Isagen sale, which it
hoped would raise $340 million, pending a Council of State ruling
on an EPM suit filed alleging bias in the sales process.
     The Council of State, which oversees state agencies, ruled
Friday that the energy regulator was in its rights when it ruled
earlier this year against any single company taking a majority
stake in Isagen to avoid market dominance.
     EPM is planning to purchase the government's 76 percent stake
in Isagen together with Enron Corp. of the U.S. to avoid the anti-
monopoly regulations.

scheduled to be completed on February 9, and we'll be able to effect our 
moves the following Monday, February 12.  

The move paperwork will be handled as one complete request.  You may be 
contacted for your social security number, current location, etc. if we don't 
already have that information.

On another note, a couple of people have voiced complaints about the air 
quality on the 47th floor.  The air filters have been replaced with high 
density, thicker filters which should make a significant improvement.  The 
Facilities group will also perform some additional testing to check our air 
quality.

If you'll be out of the office on Monday and need help getting your desk 
packed, please let Elizabeth know by Thursday, 2/8.  

Please call her at x33896 if you have any questions.

How now, Mad Cow

A slowing economy, unfavorable exchange rates and new fears about Mad Cow
disease are all taking a toll on McDonald's. What better reason for a
contrarian to buy.

By Michael Sivy

For a decade, McDonald's stock set a record high every single year. Then in
1999, the stock peaked just short of $50 a share -- and it's been downhill
ever since. McDonald's hit a low of less than $27 in September, and the
share price has recovered by only $4 since then. The global hamburger chain
still appears to face a spate of problems, but many contrarian-minded
analysts see a great buying opportunity.

With 28,000 outlets in 120 countries, McDonald's gets about half its sales
and operating profits outside of North America. Overall earnings were able
to expand at an 11.5 percent compound annual rate through most of the 1990s
because double-digit growth internationally gave a huge boost to
single-digit gains in the United States. But the global growth engine began
to falter with the Asian financial crisis in 1998.

Since then, overseas results have been penalized by unfavorable exchange
rates, particularly the weak euro, which erodes the value of profits earned
in much of Europe. This year, for instance, foreign exchange losses could
clip nearly 5 percent from McDonald's net income. Recently, however, an
even bigger problem has emerged in Europe: the resurgence of Mad Cow disease.

Various forms of brain disease have long occurred spontaneously in both
animals and humans. But adding the remnants of slaughtered animals to
cattle feed -- a practice that used to be widespread in the U.K. -- appears
to have spread some form of the disease more widely in that country.
Recently, however, infected cows have also been identified on the
Continent, leading to fears about the safety of European beef. Analysts
believe that could lead to a temporary drop in the consumption of
McDonald's hamburgers. Indeed, the company's European sales were off 11
percent in November.

It's scary, but it's also hard to believe that there will be any
significant damage to McDonald's long-term results. The use of animal
remains in feed is heavily restricted today, and there is little evidence
that the practices that promoted Mad Cow were ever significant outside of
the U.K.

Moreover, because of quality concerns, McDonald's has always been highly
selective about its suppliers. So the beef it buys is likely to conform to
the highest local safety standards. And to the extent that sales of beef
are hurt in continental Europe, McDonald's can promote alternative
products, as it already does in countries where local customs discourage
beef consumption.

Once the Mad Cow scare dies down, currency exchange trends should also help
the stock. After declining in value for nearly two years, the euro could
rebound by 10 percent or more over the next 12 months, according to
forecasters. McDonald's will open some 1,800 new outlets this year -- 200
in the U.S. and the rest in foreign markets. And store growth in 2001 is
projected to be roughly the same. Over the next five years, earnings per
share could rise nearly 12 percent annually.

The stock, which is both a growth favorite and a popular defensive choice
(suitable now that tech is in trouble), has traded at P/Es in the mid-20s
over the past few years. At a current $31, though, shares go for less than
20 times next year's estimated earnings of at least $1.60 a share. Based on
expected earnings growth and a modest P/E increase as recent bad news
abates, analysts see the stock reaching $42 or more before the end of 2001.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

1676,"Louise,

The overall idea seems logical as a method to leverage collateral received on profitable deals.
One additional benefit would be if this allowed us to use other securities as collateral that a counterparty would not accept (I'm not sure what kind of other securities we have).
I also think that for EnronOnline to continue it's success that in the medium term it will need some form of margining/collateral as part of the system, but you will have a better sense for weither this would be an issue in the US given a healthy Enron - it is an issue in Europe and with banks regardless.

Issues:
Big systems issue for implementing a same day mark to market and liquidity calculation accross all products on EnronOnline. Therefore, I assume this would be rolled out only on the highest volume products. This will increase the cost of each transaction.
Liquidity algorithm will be hard for counterparties to swallow as they will not want to post incremental capital.
Contract Issue - do you make the collateral part of all EnronOnline deals as if you don't it will be difficult to differentiate between counterparties.
Existing exposures - How do we assign the collateral rights on existing net exposures to VMAC. This will likely be a logistical issue as you must have many counterparties but if the high value ones are few it could be doable, but why would the counterparty agree as he should already have our collateral (e.g. LC) or this may require him posting more.
Timing - This might be implemented by end of Q1, but is unlikely to give you immediate benefit.
Cost - Am not sure what US brokerage is but this seems to be equivalent to 40% of brokerage as it is being paid on both sides. Does this destroy margins.
Threshold - Would there be a credit threshold as if not this would be very onnerous on all parties.

Quick win:
Effectively you are using collateral received to post collateral through a sleave. Would it not be possible to negotiate this directly with a counterparty given a select few who require high postings currently. In either case you would have to negotiate adjustment to collateral but if it can be done without a sleave but with a bigger haircut then you would avoid the delay in setting this up wholesale. I do not know if this is legally possible. 

I'll call to discuss and if you want me to do more detailed work let me know.

1680,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FERC Settlement Developments
SoCal Ed. MOU/Plan B
The CPUC's New Rate Proposal

FERC Developments
FERC's publicly recognized autonomy regarding California power talks likely has a less public, less autonomous, role in determining the outcome of debated refunds.  The following analysis emphasizes the multiple dimensions and variables now at play in the California settlement negotiations:

The Bush Administration does have influence over what FERC decides -- especially now that Pat Wood and other Republicans are there. The influence is certainly not formal (as FERC is supposed to be an independent agency), but the commissioners generally do not issue decisions without taking the ""political lay of the land"" -- particularly regarding the positions of the White House.
Bush and Davis do not like each other (no surprise there). Communication between the Davis Administration, the White House and FERC is not free flowing. Interaction between FERC and White House is frequent -- but with Davis only on an as-needed basis. (Staff level contacts are more regular -- especially staff of the Democrat commissioners).
Administrative Law Judge C. Wagner will probably recommend a refund at under or close to $1 B -- and the Commission will not go higher than what the judge recommends. This would be for October forward. Wagner thinks there may be additional refunds ordered later.  
Wagner has also strongly advised FERC and Bush (as well as his top advisors) that they will have to put price caps on, stick with them and show real efforts to deal with this issue (even though those steps run afoul of the ""free market"" position of the Admin -- and his own members). He has a great deal of influence with Bush.  

MOU & Pan B
Late Thursday (7/12) Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg called a briefing for business community leaders regarding a new proposal to alter the terms of the Edison MOU.  The new proposal (now ABXX 82) reduces the value of SoCal's transmission system to 2 times book value (the state had previously agreed to pay 2.3 times the book value, or $2.76B).  Given the dire financial condition of the Socal Edison's parent company (EIX), the legislature now realizes that they are unlikely to see any cash infusion above the $420M already promised by EIX.  Assembly moderate Democrats led by Keeley and Hertzberg feel that a $4.5B generator refund, a profit from the State's sale of the SoCal transmission lines, and an additional $1B from a dedicated rate component are all distant, but hopeful possibilities that could fuel progress for a SoCal bail-out.  Of course, two thirds of these suggestions require FERC approval.


PG&E predictably views the new proposal ""DOA"" because it is a less attractive model to be applied in their bankruptcy proceedings than the initial SoCal MOU.  Alternately, at least one of Edison's executives indicated that SCE was confident that there would be a legislative proposal flowing from the MOU that the utility would ultimately be able to accept. He went on to describe the contours of such a proposal: It has to ""make it look like Edison is getting hurt"" to counter consumer group criticism that it is a bailout. This would be accomplished by providing something less than the $3.8 billion in under-collections. He also noted that the tricky part would be picking the right percentage below 100% -- go too low, and the generators drag SCE into bankruptcy.

CPUC Rates
The PUC will likely publish shortly (in a matter of days) a new rate agreement giving the DWR first call over the utilities on any money available for purchasing power.  If this rate agreement leaves SoCal with too little cash to operate going forward, the likelihood will increase that SoCal will file for bankruptcy protection.  It does not appear that there is enough cash for purchasing power under the current structure for both DWR and SoCal to remain solvent; therefore, in order to save SoCal from bankruptcy, the legislation governing DWR's power purchases will likely have to be revised.",SoCal Ed Pat Wood Bush Davis C.

 Player Updates?Scouting Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Cade McNown , QB CHI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 McNown will return as the Bears' starting quarterback for this Sunday's game 
against the 49ers after missing six weeks with a separated shoulder. Fantasy 
owners who have advanced this far into the playoffs should not consider 
picking up McNown for this week's game. He is too much of a risk after 
missing an extended period of time, especially at this point of the season.   

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Testaverde has been upgraded from questionable to probable for Sunday's game 
against the Lions. He injured his groin in last week's game in Oakland, but 
has returned to practice and is taking his normal reps with the first team 
offense. Fantasy owners who have Testaverde are breathing a collective sigh 
of relief as the Fantasy playoffs near an end. The Jets' quarterback should 
have some success this week against Detroit, whose secondary has been ravaged 
by injuries.   

 Dolphins , DT MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Miami's defense once again showed why it is one of the league's finest 
units, holding the Buccaneers to only three field goals in a 16-13 loss. 
Tampa Bay's touchdown came on 31-yard interception return by Bucs' linebacker 
Jaime Duncan. The Dolphins host the Colts this week, whom they held to only 
14 points back in Week 12. Starting the Miami D is a must during the final 
weeks of the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Olindo Mare , K MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Mare has nailed his last 12 field goals in a row, including two on Sunday 
against the Bucaneers. Look for the Miami placekicker to get a few chances to 
score this week against the Colts, as the Dolphins looks to put a 
stranglehold on the AFC East title.    

 Tony Martin , WR MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Martin caught five passes for 67 yards in his first start since returning 
from a foot injury. With very little playing time under his belt in recent 
weeks, Martin is a very risky player to consider for your starting lineup 
during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Gadsden caught four passes for 75 yards but was held out of the end zone in 
last week's game against the Buccaneers. He faces a Colts' secondary this 
week that held him to only 30 yards receiving in Week 12. However, he did 
score a touchdown in the game. Gadsden is a cinch starter this week in 
leagues requiring three starting wideouts, and should also be considered for 
leagues with two receiver sets as well.   

 Adam Vinatieri , K NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Vinatieri has been one of the league's most accurate  placekickers in recent 
weeks, converting on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his 
chances against the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense 
struggles like it did on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's 
elite kickers on your roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   

 Jermaine Wiggins , TE NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Wiggins has been a real surprise since being signed by the Patriots two 
weeks ago. In his first two games with New England, Wiggins has caught nine 
passes for 80 yards and touchdown - decent numbers for a tight end. If you 
lose Chad Lewis becuase of Philly's bye week and need a replacement, picking 
up Wiggins could pay off.   

 Raymont Harris , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Harris, who was just recently re-signed by New England, carried the ball 
only three times for 14 yards in his first game back. With the Patriots 
constantly rotating tailbacks, Harris' Fantasy value is in serious question. 
It's good idea to avoid all New England tailbacks at this point in the 
season.   

 Troy Brown , WR NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Brown has caught two touchdowns in the last two weeks and is making a case 
to be on your Fantasy playoff team late in the year. He will face a Buffalo 
secondary this week that has been hurt by injuries, so giving Brown the start 
in leagues that require three wideouts isn't such a bad option.     

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Watters missed Tuesday's practice with a turf toe injury. Watters was able 
to play at Denver this past week despite the problem. Don't expect him to 
miss this week's game against Oakland.   

 Terry Glenn , WR NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Glenn finally got into the end zone last week against Chicago, which is a 
good sign for Fantasy owners at this stage of the season. He will get his 
chances to score this week against the Bills, who have really been hurt by 
injuries on defense.   

 Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Kaufman has a bruised right leg in addition to his quadriceps injury. He 
might not play at Seattle, and Terry Kirby might be activated. Randy Jordan 
and Zack Crockett would see more playing time with both Kaufman and Jon 
Ritchie out.    

 Kevin Faulk , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Faulk will likely be splitting time with both J.R. Redmond and Raymont 
Harris for the remainder of the season, which is not the scenario Fantasy 
owners are looking for at this time of the year. There is only one Faulk in 
the NFL who deserves to start in your Fantasy playoffs - and he plays in St. 
Louis.   

 J.R. Redmond , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Redmond only saw limited action last week against the Bears because of his 
injured ribs, which have taken a toll on his production. It isn't certain how 
much playing time he will get in the final two weeks, so it's a good idea to 
keep  Redmond on your bench during the Fantasy playoffs.    

 Cardinals , DT ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 You want to talk about defensive inefficiency? Arizona's defense has given 
up an average of 32.4 points per game over their last five games. If for some 
reason you've held onto the Cardinals' defesne this long, you're probably 
already out of your league's playoffs. If not, make sure to look anywhere but 
Arizona for a starting defense.   

 Cary Blanchard , K ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Blanchard has converted on only four of his last nine field goal attempts 
for Arizona, which has decreased his already low Fantasy value. Being the 
placekicker on a team with an enemic offense doesn't help, either - the Cards 
have only scored 42 points over the last four weeks. Give Blanchard the boot 
for the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs.   

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Will the real Frank Sanders please stand up? After three poor performances, 
Sanders caught four passes for 90 yards and a score against Jacksonville. 
Fantasy owners never know what they're getting with Sanders from week to 
week, which is why he isn't a viable option during the playoffs.   

 David Boston , WR ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Boston struggled to produce for Fantasy owners against Jacksonville last 
week, and will likely be in for another rough week against the Ravens. 
Baltimore sports the number one defense in the NFL, and has allowed only 
eight touchdowns through the air the entire season. Avoid using Boston this 
week if at all possible.   

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Jones had 40 yards on seven carries in last week's loss to the Jaguars. The 
rookie could see added carries as the season comes to an end, but he still 
shouldn't be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Torry Holt , WR STL -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Holt has a slight hip injury but will play in this week's game.  Expect him 
to maintain a high level of play during the final rounds of the Fantasy 
playoffs.    

 Herman Moore , WR DET -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Moore had a headache from hitting his head on the turf in the Lions' first 
offensive play Sunday.  He was knocked groggy, but X-rays showed no damage.  
However, if you put him in your Fantasy lineup at this point in the season 
his production will damage your playoff hopes.  Avoid using him if you 
can.         

 Alfred Pupunu , TE DET -  Updated 12/13/00 
 The Lions cut tight end Alfred Pupunu and signed safety Ryan Stewart. 
Pupunu, a former San Diego Charger, has no Fantasy value right now.   

 Eddie George , RB TEN -  Updated 12/13/00 
 George re-injured the big toe on his right foot during Sunday's game, and 
took a pain-killing injection and is wearing an immobilizing boot to help in 
his rehabilitation. His Fantasy owners have to be hoping he'll play against 
Cleveland, a team against which he has 344 rushing yards and seven TDs in his 
last three games, on Sunday.  

 Steve McNair , QB TEN -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Coach Jeff Fisher said McNair's sprained ankle is ""swollen, stiff and sore,"" 
but it's far improved over where he was last week. McNair is expected to play 
Sunday against Cleveland, and we can't help but expect good numbers from him 
after his impressive three-TD performance last Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 Steelers , DT PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 The Steelers will be without strong safety Lee Flowers for Saturday's game 
against Washington. Flowers is second on the team in tackles and is tied for 
the lead in forced fumbles, and has an undisclosed knee injury. Ainsley 
Battles will get the start in his place. Pittsburgh's defensive unit hasn't 
been posting great numbers in recent weeks, so it might be wise to skip using 
it against Washington on Saturday.   

 Courtney Hawkins , WR PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Hawkins has lost his starting job at split end to Troy Edwards, after a poor 
performance last Sunday against the Giants. Hawkins had just two catches for 
seven yards in the game, and hasn't been getting it done in recent weeks. He 
has no Fantasy value the remainder of the season.  

 Troy Edwards , WR PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Edwards will get the start at split end, in place of Courtney Hawkins, for 
Saturday's game against Washington. He had 61 catches playing there last 
season, but wasn't as successful at flanker this year. Despite this switch, 
we don't forecast good Fantasy numbers from Edwards over the final two weeks. 
 

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Stewart was given a day off from practice on Tuesday in order to rest his 
sprained right calf. He said that the decision was a precautionary measure, 
and that he'd be back in practice Wednesday and will start Saturday against 
Washington. Stewart has a tough matchup with this Redskins pass defense - 
he's a risky start during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Testaverde has been upgraded from questionable to probable for Sunday's game 
against the Lions. He injured his groin in last week's game in Oakland, but 
has returned to practice and is taking his normal reps with the first team 
offense. Fantasy owners who have Testaverde are breathing a collective sigh 
of relief as the Fantasy playoffs near an end. The Jets' quarterback should 
have some success this week against Detroit, whose secondary has been ravaged 
by injuries.

The model looks great except when I changed an input and hit go it blew up.  
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  One thing that I would like changed is that 
I want to make the swap product and product that settles against the 2nd last

Please change that if you can.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

1691,"Now that the accrual book is fresh on your mind, I would like to propose the 
following for Schedule C prudency:

1)  Monetize $20 million of the 2001 accrual gas position to be utilized for 
the following Schedule C prudency accounts:

$10 million against the JEA (Northern Florida) short position (170,000 MWh's 
on-peak).   We have mid-marketers attempting to buy energy for 01 and 02 in 
FL, however, the market is extremely tight with no competitive offers.   The 
JEA position is covered with FPL non-firm power, therefore, we are exposed to 
on-peak price volatility due to FPL economic curtailment during load 
management periods.
$3 million against the VEPCO market-based call option with a look back audit 
on pricing.  This deal is an absolute pain in the ass because we are forced 
to quote a price to VEPCO that is representative of an actual transaction at 
reasonable prices with a rationale counterparty in the SE market.  They can 
call on the MW daily, weekly, or monthly.   We can lose as much as $2-3 
million/yr on this BS position due to the logistical issues and look back 
audit rights that VEPCO has.
$2 million against the MJMUC (inside Associated Electric Coop) 40 MW 7x24 
short position in a transmission constrained market area with absolutely no 
liquidity.  We have this position marked against the Entergy curves, however, 
physical delivery is a major issue which creates curtailment (and LD$) 
uncertainty.
$5 million against the OPPD 110 MW daily shaped call (with hourly 
flexibility) that is nearly impossible to hedge cleanly.   OPPD is in 
Southern MAPP (Nebraska) and delivery risks are significant.  The total deal 
is in our books at negative $25 million (10/2/00 curves) and we potentially 
have an additional $5 million of exposure due to illiquid nature of MAPP, 
scalar risk, and physical delivery risk.

We have several other customer deals that have hair, however, they are 
generally more manageable from a physical delivery standpoint.   Each of the 
deals above are in illiquid markets with delivery problems and scheduling 
flexibility for the counterparty that is incosistent with the current power 
trading market.   For these generic reasons and the specific issues outlined 
above, I am recommending Schedule C prudency for the amounts indicated 
above.  
From my standpoint, it is prudent and appropriate to use $20 million from gas 
accrual gains to finance these prudency positions.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.",,"$20 million $10 million $3 million as much as $2-3

and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") transactions in Lilly stock.  In light of
the complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe
penalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any
transaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,
including:

-   purchases
-   sales
-   gifts
-   trust or partnership transactions
-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
-   exchange fund transactions

We request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two
reasons:

   There are certain times when you should not engage in market
   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these ""black-outs"" occur around
   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are
   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of ""inside
   information"" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our
   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.
   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to
   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have
   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.

2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.

If you had any Lilly stock transactions in September, please advise me as
soon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature
and file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"").  The
reports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day
of the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am
not available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any
proposed transaction.

If you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate
to call me.  Thank you for your cooperation.

_____________________________________________________________________

The STOCK INDEXES The Nasdaq and S&P's posted inside days with lower
closes. Light pressure came from some negative pre- announcements on
earnings in tech stocks that led to today's consolidation. The March
S&P is consolidating just below trendline resistance crossing near
1410. The March Nasdaq has broken out above this fall's downtrend
line crossing near 2900 thereby hinting a bottom and trend change may
be in place. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling sideways to
higher prices in both markets are possible near-term. Meanwhile, the
Dow closed modestly higher as it extends its rebound off last
Thursday's low. Closes above 10,917.30 are needed to extend this
month's rebound into the end of the year.

INTEREST RATES March bonds closed modestly higher on the day due to a
late-session short covering rebound triggered by today's decline in
the Nasdaq. Trading remains choppy, as the market is nervous over the
much-anticipated ruling by the Supreme Court that should decide the
outcome of the U.S. Presidential election. March bonds are
challenging November's uptrend line crossing near 102- 28. Multiple
closes below this support level would all but confirm a top and trend
change has taken place. Closes above last week's high at 104 are
needed to resume the late-fall rally.

CRB INDEX closed sharply lower on Tuesday pressured by weakness in
heating oil, unleaded gas, cotton, foods, and grains. The CRB has
been range bound following last Monday's strong rally and appears to
be forming a possible symmetrical triangle. A breakout in either
direction of this consolidation pattern should lead to a trending
move in the direction of the breakout. Momentum indicators are
neutral to bearish warning traders that a broad double top with
October's high also appears to be forming.

ENERGIES The energy markets closed mixed on Tuesday as February crude
oil closed slightly higher while the product markets were lower
following the release of bearish API (American Petroleum Institute)
data, which showed gasoline and distillate stocks including heating
oil building. Nevertheless, the oversold condition of the energy
complex has left the doors open for a short covering rebound into the
end of the year especially if Iraq continues its oil embargo while
negotiating over price with the United Nations. Look for sideways to
lower price action on Wednesday.

CURRENCIES the March Dollar closed slightly lower on Tuesday due to
light profit taking as it consolidated some of its gains off last
week's low. Nevertheless, momentum indicators are oversold and
turning neutral to bullish signaling sideways to higher prices into
the end of the year are possible. The March Swiss Franc and D-mark
closed steady to slightly higher due to light short covering on
Tuesday. However, today's poor closes leave the doors open for
sideways to lower prices near-term as both markets appear to have
posted short-term tops with last week's highs. The March Japanese Yen
closed lower on Tuesday after opening under pressure. Concerns over
the Japanese economy and uncertainty over the U.S. Presidential race
triggered today's sell off in the yen. Closes below .9088 would renew
this fall's decline and set the stage for a test of weekly support
crossing at .8978 later this winter.

PRECIOUS METALS were closed mixed on Tuesday. February gold posted a
quiet inside day due to light short covering as it consolidated some
of its recent losses. However, today's mid-range close leaves the
door open for a resumption of the decline off last week's high.
Closes below trendline support crossing near 271.80 would confirm
this fall's rebound has likely come to an end. March silver extended
Monday's short covering rally. However, early gains faded into the
close hinting this week's bounce has likely come to an end. March
silver is poised to renew its decline off last week's high with
November's lows at 4.69 cents being the next target. March copper
closed lower on Tuesday following Monday's spike above the 62%
retracement level of this fall's decline, which crosses at 89.47.
Closes below November's uptrend line crossing near 87.50 would all
but confirm the late-fall rebound has come to an end. Momentum
indicators are overbought and turning neutral to bearish with today's
loss.

GRAINS closed lower on Tuesday. March corn closed fractionally lower
in relatively quiet trading following this morning's neutral supply
and demand report. The USDA lowered its export projection by 75
million bushels to 2.2 billion bushels. The also raised ending stocks
by the same amount to 1.754 billion bushels. These changes were
widely anticipated by the market. Momentum indicators remain bearish
signaling March corn is likely to drift sideways to lower into the
end of the year. Bulls are hopeful that the Starlink issue will be
resolved by then, which should lead to an increase in foreign demand
after the first of the year. March wheat also closed lower on Tuesday
despite today's surprise increase in this year's export projection by
the USDA. Expectations for lower production in Australia and Europe
led to the increase. Carryout was also cut from 892 to 862 million
bushels. However, spillover weakness from soybeans and meal was
enough of a reason to trigger the late-session sell off. March is
challenging trading range support crossing at 2.69. Closes below this
support level could lead to a test of Sept.'s low at 2.63 1/2 and
possibly long-term support at 2.50 later this winter.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed mixed on Tuesday. January beans finished the
day on the minus side despite today's increase in U.S. export
projections. The USDA raised export sales for this year from 950 to
975 million bushels and lowered carryout by 30 million bushels to 320
million bushels. January beans are consolidating around fib
resistance crossing at 5.10 3/4. The rising ADX signals sideways to
higher prices near-term are possible. If the post-harvest rally
continues, the fall high at 5.25 is a target. January soybean meal
extended its rebound off last Friday's low following today's friendly
supply and demand report. The USDA raised its export project some
200,000 tons to 7,300 million tons for the year. The increase was due
entirely to the expected increase of meal demand from Europe due to
the recent ban on meat and bone meal in animal feed. While light
profit taking is possible on Wednesday to consolidate some of this
week's gains. The door remains open for sideways to higher prices
into the end of the year. January bean oil closed lower on Tuesday
following today's bearish supply and demand report. The USDA raised
ending stocks from 2.145 to 2.250 billion pounds and lowered export
projections from 1.650 to 1.550 billion pounds. Additional weakness
on Wednesday would set the stage for a test of November's low at
14.64 later this month.

LIVESTOCK closed mixed on Tuesday. February hogs closed lower as
locals faded the funds who are holding sizable long positions.
Additional pressure came from light profit taking following Monday's
spike of the previous contract high. At the same time, cash and pork
cut out values continue to climb due to adverse weather conditions
across the Midwest. Momentum indicators are overbought and diverging,
which is often a precursor to a top and trend change. Closes below
trendline support crossing near 57.40 are needed before this is
confirmed. February cattle posted a key reversal up as it surged to
new highs for the month amid higher boxed-beef prices and
expectations for $76-77 cash bids later this week. Additional support
came from aggressive buying from a believed to be large northwestern
U.S. cattle feeder. February cattle are poised to test long-term
resistance crossing at 77.92 possibly on Wednesday.

FOOD & FIBER markets were mixed on Tuesday. March coffee drifted
lower in choppy trading on Tuesday amidst a bearish weather forecast
for this weekend across Brazil. A short covering bounce ahead of the
close tempered some of today's losses leaving the door open for a
short covering bounce on Wednesday. March cocoa extended this week's
decline and spiked below November's low at 713 before a short
covering bounce tempered some of today's losses. Today's high-range
close leaves the door open for additional short covering on Wednesday
however, the door is open for a test of psychological support
crossing at 700. March sugar posted an inside day with a lower close
due to a lack of fresh news in the cash market. Momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling sideways to lower prices into the end of the
year are possible. If the decline resumes, 930 is the next target.
March cotton gapped down and closed sharply lower following today's
bearish supply and demand report. The USDA pegged U.S. production at
17.4 million bales down from last month's estimate of 17.51 million
bales. However, the USDA also raised world ending stocks from 35.10
to 35.69 million bales due to lower demand. Today's gap down and
close below the July/October uptrend line confirms a broad double top
has been posted. The door is open for additional weakness and a
possible test of October's low crossing at 63.75 later this winter.

1755,"Michelle,

If you have experienced problems using TW Deal Analysis lately, it has been 
fixed.

Whenever we run TW Deal Analysis, we have the report id generated by the 
database automatically.
Unfortunately the database crashed and recovered later.  It did not start 
from the last number in the database,
instead,  it started with a very large 12 digit number.  The application did 
not expect to handle such a large
number and could not continue.  

I am working on changing report id generation to be manual function so that 
next time
if database server crashes, the application will not be affected.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

1756,"DEFS Finishes 2000 With Multiple Transactions

Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) finished off 2000 with a bang by completing 
three year-end asset transactions. First, the company finalized the $91 
million sale of natural gas liquid (NGL) pipeline assets to TEPPCO Crude 
Pipeline, L.P., then it completed the purchase of certain natural gas 
pipeline assets from El Paso Field Services in two separate deals for an 
undisclosed sum. 

The assets sold to TEPPCO include the Panola Pipeline and the San Jacinto 
Pipeline, both of which are NGL pipelines. Under the agreement, TEPPCO also 
agreed to take over the lease of a 34-mile condensate pipeline. The three 
pipelines included in the sale all originate at DEFS' East Texas Plant 
Complex located in Panola County, TX. 

""This sale underscores our strategy of growing earnings through our TEPPCO 
master limited partnership,"" said Jim Mogg, CEO of DEFS. ""In 2000, we almost 
doubled the distribution that DEFS received as the general partner of TEPPCO 
Partners, L.P., and at the same time increased the distribution to limited 
partnership unitholders."" 

In the second transaction, which the company completed on Dec. 28, 2000, DEFS 
acquired 100% of Gas Transmission Teco, Inc.'s common stock. The company owns 
interests in the 500-mile Teco intrastate natural gas pipeline in Texas, and 
was purchased from El Paso Field Services. 

Included in the assets, DEFS gained a 50% interest in the El Paso-operated 
West Texas Line which travels from Waha to New Braunfels, a 100% interest in 
the Guadalupe Line that travels from New Braunfels to Dewville, and a 50% 
interest in the MidTex Line from Dewville to Katy. DEFS also received several 
supply lines and related assets with the acquisition. 

DEFS said the lines combined have a 250 MMcf/d of natural gas capacity, and 
extend from Waha in West Texas to Katy. The company also noted that the lines 
interconnect five DEFS plants with a combined processing capacity of 640 
MMcf/d. 

""The timely addition of this strategic system provides DEFS with increased 
marketing opportunities for the gas from these plants,"" said Mogg. ""The lines 
also allow DEFS new access to the growing San Antonio/Austin corridor."" 

In DEFS' third end of the year transaction, the company acquired El Paso 
Field Services' 50% interest in the 265-mile San Jacinto natural gas 
pipeline. The transaction brings DEFS' ownership up to 100%. The San Jacinto 
line provides gas gathering and transportation services along the Texas Gulf 
Coast, with delivery to a third party and two DEFS gas processing plants. 

DEFS was formed last year when Duke Energy and Phillips Petroleum combined 
their natural gas gathering and processing businesses. Duke Energy holds a 
70% stake in the company while Phillips retains a 30% share.

**********************

Community members,
 
Today (Thursday) the Planning Commission held a public hearing on the Prevailing Lot Size Amendment.  
 
The meeting started at 2:30pm and many, many, many agenda items later, just after 6pm(!), it was our turn to step up & speak in favor of the amendment. Talk we did, and I believe we had a good impact. 
 
Thanks to last year's NTA president & Chapter 42 expert, Jack Rose and past east Montrose president, Carmen Druke for being there for NTA.
 
Also there was Jane Cahill & Billie Mercer from Old Sixth Ward, Theo Fabio and Evalyn Krudy for University Place and BOCA and the president of Southampton CA (didn't get his name). 
 
There were folks there, too, from the Heights, making an altogether well rounded representation of the vitality of the inner-loop. 
 
There's no decision yet from the commission and we'll be watching for that. It was a long grim wait, but it what you have do to gain those little bits that add up to self determination for our neighborhoods and protection and preservation of our communities.
 
Thanks to everyone that make the effort today.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee.

need money from:
Josh Stevens
Denver Plachy
Jimmy Simien
Eric Bass
Flannigan
Jason Wolfe

Money must be to me by COB Wednesday or your entry is forfeited(if your score 
is bad and you do not pay I will not put you in any pool in the future).

Right now the pot is $410(assuming everyone pays) so the break down is 
$307.50 and $102.50 for first and second respectively.  

The following people need to give me a tiebreaker number for the final game 
by COB Today(total score for final game):
Jason Wolfe
Denver Plachy
Scott Earnest
Chad South
Doug Friedman
John Nowlan
Lee Jackson
John Swinney
Rob Fullen
Josh Stevens

If I do not get a tiebreaker from you and you tie for first, you will 
automatically get second and if you tie for second you are out of the money.  

Again, please verify your score and let me know of any discrepancies - 1 pt. 
first round victory, 2 pts. second round victory and upset gets seed 
differential.

little over the past two weeks? Is the physical overhang somewhat
counterbalanced by concerns over a widening of military action against other
nations, say Iran/Iraq? If you answered yes to all of these, you're eligible to
read further...

Just some facts:

*The US Northeast is now seeing the coldest temperatures all season, yet heat
cracks lost value yesterday.
*Gas cracks are still holding the $7.00 range, a sign the market is still
willing to give gas season the benefit of the doubt but not much more.
*Russia is still a concern for overproduction. A very soft economy and a desire
for hard currency could easily lead Russian oil companies to cheat the recent
quota.



The technical pattern looks very much like a bearish head and shoulders(see
chart below, I'm referring only to the most recent range between $18 and $22).
At the very least, it implies we will test the neckline again in the next two
weeks. This comes in right at $18.00. A close below would signal thew move
towards $14.00 that looks inevitable for now since the dominant channel is a
downward one. You can also see how we've had difficulty establishing $20.00 as
resistance or support; this is key since it will determine whether the next move
is to $24 or $17.25. Since gas is the seasonal product and gas cracks are still
firm, the range is still dominant. I would expect a close below $18.00 would be
coupled with a move back to or below $6.00 on Q2 gas cracks. But for now, expect
the move back towards $18.00 to get funds shorter again, then also expect the
market to use those new shorts as an upside squeeze play.

I will be preparing the loan documents for the joint venture with Peoples.  I 
understand that the loans will be unsecured but cross guarantied (i.e., Enron 
will guaranty the People's loans and vice versa), but I have several 
additional, basic questions re:  the terms of the Enron loan and the 
intercreditor arrangements with Peoples.

In terms of beginning drafting the loan documents, answers to questions 6(a) 
and 8 would be extremely helpful in selecting an appropriate form.

1.  People's loan agreement -- will it be an exact clone of ours?

2.  Guaranties -- will the cross-guaranties guaranty payment to the other 
venturer of all unpaid amounts under such venturer's loan agreement, or will 
they instead function more as an intercreditor/sharing agreement (i.e., if 
one venturer receives a payment that the other does not, the paid venturer 
will share its payment ratably with the unpaid venturer)?

3.  Intercreditor Issues/Exercise of remedies -- Please confirm that there is 
to be no 100% lender vote requirement for acceleration, etc., and that each 
venturer can pursue remedies with respect to its loan independently (although 
I presume the facilities will be cross defaulted).

4.  Advancing mechanics -- besides requiring ratable advances with the 
People's facility, will there be any conditions precedent to advances other 
than the typical no default/representations true & correct/no MAC?

5.  Repayment -- will there be any commitment step-downs/mandatory 
prepayments?

6.  Interest -- what will the (a) interest rate basis and (b) margin be?

7.  Fees -- Will there be any sort of upfront fee?  What will the commitment 
fee be? (And what will the amount of Enron's commitment be?)

8.  Lender(s) -- Does Enron intend to keep its revolver as a single lender 
facility, or should we provide for a syndicated arrangement?

9.  Other information -- When will specific financial covenant information be 
available?

Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing.  I look forward to 
working with you on this transaction.

1880,"Hello everyone.  More fun issues from Chicago.  I would like to discuss the 
different options available for giving parent guarantees to third parties.  
As everyone knows, to date we have had two third party transactions requiring 
parent guarantees.  In the Trunkline transaction, each parent issued separate 
guarantees for 1/2 of the requested amount, negotiated by respective 
counsel.  In the Alliance transaction, Enron issued a guarantee for the 
entire amount and Peoples has presented us with a reimbursement agreement 
which we are reviewing.  Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4, to 
approve the risk management policy.  Assuming the policy is approved, deal 
flow should begin to increase and I would like to discuss how these 
guarantees can best be handled going forward.  My thought was an hour or so 
next Monday, Oct. 2, to the extent everyone is available, with a follow up 
meeting with Peoples perhaps Wednesday.  Let me know how your calendar looks 
and I will coordinate the meeting.

this is part of a larger issue regarding negotiations of enovate contracts in

 I will try to fax you each my additions on Tuesday, as I will be back in the

 I will have my cell on this afternoon and Tuesday while travelling, but I

1889,"The problem as I see it with respect to a material default argument is that 
Article 16 re TD&I doesn't set a standard as to how/when such services will 
be furnished by GE.  Does Ex. H-1 set forth such criteria or does it merely 
describe the types of services furnished?  

Maybe in Article 16 we could try to put similar timing and cover  provisions 
as found in Article 14 re GE's warranty obligations. 

As we all know presently TD&I is a touchy subject with all the GTG vendors as 
a result of record equipment orders and lack of qualified technical reps.

I agree that the LD's don't apply as presently drafted and that we should 
discuss internally with the team before we launch back our position to GE.  
Any suggestions from the rest of the group?

Go ahead and issue the breakout contract as is for the LM6000's at Austin.  I 
will give you some wording for a change order to increase the number of TD of 
I hours and days of per diem.  The way the contract is written, it will save 
us money to issue a change order as opposed to changing the base number of 
hours in the contract.

Sections 2.0 and 8.0 of Exhibit H-1 states that over time hours within the 
original 240 hour total are deduducted at time and a half.  Total TD of I 
hours worked in excess of the 240 hour total are only marked up by 22%.  
(Straight time = $135/hr, overtime = $165/hr)  

I will give you some wording as soon as I get an estimate from the field on 
how many days of per diem will be used.

1891,"I have gone through the Version 3 of the ABB agreement that you forwarded. I 
have compared it to the other versions and changes I was aware of (the 
technical areas only). I have attached a red-lined version with edits. Also, 
here are my notes on each of the changes:

Section 5.1 of the Agreement - earlier versions of the Agreement contained 
the purchase amount here. As I commented by phone, by my calculation the 
total purchase amount for these two units would be $1,713,000.00, or 
$856,500.00 each. By my records, the original purchase amount for these units 
was $782,000.00. A change was made in November 2000 that increased each unit 
by $49,500.00. Another change in December 2000 increased each unit by 
$25,000.00. These increase amounts were confirmed by ABB on 11/28/00 and 
12/18/00. The Version 3 document eliminates this purchase amount.. However, 
sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 contain amounts of $78,200.00, 10% on the original 
purchase amount of one unit. Should these values be changed?

Exhibit B1:
Section 5.1.2 b) and c) - these are revisions requested by the contractor. 
They are reasonable requests if they can be accommodated by ABB. I don not 
know if these changes were coordinated directly between the contractor and 
ABB.

Section 9.1 - minimum ambient temperature
Minimum ambient temperature should be minus 5 degrees C. This corresponds to 
23 degrees F, the design basis temperature. The minus 13.3 degrees C 
requested by the contractor is incorrect.

Section 9.5.5 - Surge Arrestor rating
This is a new request from the contractor. It appears acceptable.

Section 10 - Voltage Rating
This is a correction to indicate a voltage of 138,000

Section 10 - Type of Cooling
This is added information on type of cooling (FOA) as provided by ABB in 
thier revised data sheets.

The other changes in Sections 9 and 10 correspond to information previously 
provided to ABB in conference calls and communications from the contractor.

attorney for the Publilc Staff, to my inquiry regarding the security of
information submitted to the Commission under seal.  It largely tracks our
understanding and analysis.  The following are her words:

""To my knowledge, no one has challenged anything filed with the
Commission under seal pursuant to the trade secret statute.  Under that
statute, if you want the information claimed to be a trade secret, you
have to go to court and carry the burden (and my recollection from
reading the statute is that it is a very high burden).  The only other
way it could be made public would be for the Commission to order it to
be made public (because it isn't a trade secret), which to my knowledge
has never happened with anything even remotely of commercial value and
even then the owner of the information could go to court to stop it.
Costs related to generation are the most obviously ""trade secret"" type
information with which we deal. None of the utilities would try to claim
it isn't protected, because then they would have to reveal their
information.  CUCA could try to get it in order to participate in the
hearing, but CUCA generally supports IPP development (in general), and
Jamie would have to sign a nondisclosure agreement and not reveal the
information to anyone.  For all practical purposes, Enron is safe.
(Even if a claim were made, Enron could tie it up until the information
was so old it was worth much less, if anything.)""",Gisele Rankin Jamie,,"the Publilc Staff Commission the

We build into all of these contracts that the counterparty may at any time, chose to transact directly with a third counterparty.  We would still administer the contracts and perform the scheduling etc. for them if they chose to do this.  In this way, the customer may always chose to deal directly if they chose and we would be doing the scheduling.  I believe that this will serve to counteract concerns that we will not provide them fair market prices since they could always chose to deal directly.  We are confident that our prices are will be competitive and that the counterparty will chose to transact through us.  We would of course need to protect our share of the benefit in the case they transact with someone else.

Still under consideration - The Enron Corporate Insurance group under Jim 
Bouillion will now report into the corporate organization under  George 
Wasaff.

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President and Chief 
Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of the Chairman, and to 
Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for Enron 
Corp.  He will be responsible to Sally Beck for the business operations areas 
of the businesses.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila 
Glover, business controller for Financial Products;  Todd Hall, business 
controller for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global 
liquids and coal.  In addition, Tom Myers as Director of Accounting.  Brent 
and his team are responsible for all accounting and position reporting issues 
for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.

Mr. Alan Kent
Flair Construction Co., Inc.

RE: Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction
Co., Inc., as Seller, and Mike & Chris McConnell, as Buyer

Dear Mr. Kent:

We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract.  On behalf of Mr. &
Mrs. McConnell we would like to make the following comments and suggestions.

Generally, our major concern is what happens if in the unlikely event Mr. &
Mrs. McConnell cannot reach an agreement with you regarding the construction
of their home?  The Homesite Reservation Agreement states that they must
sell the lots back to you as the Developer at seventy five percent (75%) of
the sales price if you, as the Builder, do not start construction within six
(6) months of the date the lots were purchased.  In such an event, Mr. &
Mrs. McConnell would lose a substantial amount of money.  Therefore, we
would like to know if you have any suggestions as to how to address this
problem.

We make the following specific comments regarding the Unimproved Property
Contract itself in chronological order.

1. Paragraph 2, Property.  As we discussed, we would like to get a copy of
the Deed Restrictions as soon as possible so as to make sure that Mr.
McConnell's house will not be atypical for this subdivision.

2. Paragraph 5, Earnest Money.  We suggest that the Earnest Money be paid to
the Title Company.

3. Paragraph 6, Title Policy & Survey, A.Title Policy (6).  In view of the
fact that The Lakes at Sterling Gate is a new subdivision, we have suggested
to Mr. & Mrs. McConnell that they request that the exception as to
discrepancies, conflicts, shortages in area or boundary lines, encroachments
or protrusions or overlapping improvements be deleted from their Owners
Policy of Title Insurance.  We understand that Mr. & Mrs. McConnell will
have to pay the additional cost for this exception to be deleted.  However,
before the Title Company will delete this exception it is necessary that a
survey of the lots being purchased be provided to the Title Company.  Do you
have or can you provide such a survey?

4. Paragraph 6, Title Policy & Survey, Notice to Seller and Buyer (6).  We
ask that this paragraph relating to your right to continue to show the
property for sale be deleted.

5. Paragraph 7, Property Condition (B).  We suggested to Mr. & Mrs.
McConnell that subparagraph one (1) be checked rather than subparagraph two
(2) reflecting that the Buyers are accepting the property in its present
condition.  Mr. & Mrs. McConnell intend on hiring an inspector and we
thought it may be a good idea for the inspector to have an opportunity to
inspect the property itself before construction.  Therefore, we ask that a
small option fee be put in to this paragraph and that Mr. & Mrs. McConnell's
inspector has thirty (30) days to check out the property accordingly.

6. Paragraph 8, Brokers Fees.  It is our understanding that Mr. Larry
Williams of Prudential, Gary Greene Realtors represents Flair Construction.
Therefore, we would ask for an affirmative statement that any brokers' fees
be paid by Flair accordingly.

7. Paragraph 11, Special Provisions.  It is written in that the closing on
these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March 1, 2001 which
ever is later.  However, we do not know what roads are being addressed and
think that this sentence needs far more specificity.  The second sentence
regarding Mr. & Mrs. McConnell's obligation to use Flair Homes has already
been addressed.  The third sentence regarding when construction must start
should be revised to give Mr. & Mrs. McConnell more time to hire an
architect, etc.  We would suggest one hundred and eighty (180) days.  Also,
once Mr. & Mrs. McConnell notify you that they are ready for construction we
believe you should be under an obligation to start construction thirty (30)
days thereafter.

8. Paragraph 13, Rollback Taxes.  As you know, if there was every an
agricultural, timber or other exemption on this property, this paragraph
states that any rollback taxes will be paid by Mr. & Mrs. McConnell.  We
want to make absolutely certain that no such exemptions exist.  Therefore,
if you could ask that Title Company to provide a Tax Certificate showing
that no exemptions exist before closing we would appreciate it.  If there
ever were such exemptions, we need to be made aware of that as soon as
possible.

9. Paragraph 18, Escrow.  As we indicated earlier, we believe the Earnest
Money should be paid to the Title Company.  Since the Earnest Money is in
excess of $50,000.00 and the closing date on the lots is somewhat uncertain,
we believe the Title Company should be asked to deposit the Earnest Money in
an interest bearing account and that Mr. & Mrs. McConnell should receive a
credit accordingly.

We would appreciate it if you could respond to each of our suggestions and
comments in this letter as soon as possible.  We know Mr. & Mrs. McConnell
are very much looking forward to working with you in connection with
construction of their home.

Very truly yours,



Donald S. Stirman

1951,"Nissho Iwai (project Sato):  We have spent a considerable amount of time over 
the last couple of weeks defining what Enron could do for them and building a 
level of trust and understanding.  Recall that a couple of their board 
members had come to us about a month ago to discuss a USD2-3 billion near 
term liquidity ""issue"".  On Friday their strategy planning group will be 
taking the proposal of cooperation with Enron to their president and some of 
their key advisors at Sanwa Bank and DKB.  We have proposed the means 
(without specific definition) of how we could provide near term liquidity and 
set the path to look for opportunities in key business areas.  Almost all the 
areas of interest are in key Global Market products.  Sanwa and DKB are part 
of the equation as they worked out a rescue deal for NI a year ago.  This 
plan also had the support from Hiyami (former NI president and now head of 
BOJ).  So any decision to handle their near term problems and future growth 
would have to get support from these key groups.  The NI team we have been 
working with seem quite positive on their prospects of getting this through 
Friday's meeting.  From this point we would proceed with a very detailed due 
diligence effort across key areas which will be mutually defined, but 
would/could include: LNG, coal, petchems, shipping, freight, metals, etc.  We 
would determine how much we could pay for certain rights and/or positions.  
If we could get something done this would have a huge impact on the market 
and would give us tremendous reach to other Japanese customers in their 
group.  During this ""liquidity solution"" phase, we will also be evaluating 
areas of growth and of mutual interest to our companies.

Hitachi: weather ventures: The #3 guy in Hitachi came to us a couple of weeks 
ago indicating that they thought there could be tremendous possibilities for 
Enron and Hitachi to jointly market weather products in Japan.  Note:  we 
have been discussing possibilities with Hitachi since Ken Lay visited.  
Hitachi does not have any weather experience, but does have a tremendous 
customer base, a large sales force and a very strong name in Japan.  As 
Hitachi are involved in just about everything, they also have business lines 
in the capital markets area and insurance.  Hitachi senior management has 
strongly implied that if we can get something done then they can deliver 
quite a few companies including the large utilities.  They could also give us 
access to the Japanese insurance companies... beyond the Marine and Fires.  I 
believe that the president of Hitachi has already decided that they want to 
do this.  In fact, in true Japanese style, they have mentioned to TEPCO that 
they would be pursing something like this with Enron to ""sort of"" get 
permission.  Hitachi could be quite useful in getting us further access to 
the utes for fuel deals as well.  What we have contemplated (and discussed 
with Tawney) is an arrangement where Enron provides the pricing for standard 
and structured products and takes on the risk of transactions (risk books 
outside venture) while Hitachi provides the customers and a trained sales 
force.  In return, Hitachi gets some sort of agency fee for each deal done.  
Hitachi also has tremendous weather risk themselves that they would be 
looking to manage from a corporate level.  They have wanted to race to an 
MOU, but we have brought them back to a CA first.  We'll be getting more 
definition over the next couple of weeks with the idea of having advanced and 
productive discussion with Tawney when he is over the middle of next month.  
Needless to say, getting something like this done with Hitachi would be a 
tremendous boost to our local credibility and would open many doors.

Nissho Iwai: methanol:  We will be presenting an indicative term sheet to 
Deutsche Bank tomorrow concerning a prepay structure for 100k+ tons of 
Methanol for up to three years out of Bontang.  We have been able to work 
down the CDS spreads from the international market for Indonesia and NI down 
from 1750 bps over Libor to approx 600.  The structure would likely involve a 
trade finance arrangement with one of the Japanese banks (with sufficient 
Bank of Indonesia deposits) providing coverage for the Bank of Indonesia who 
would provide the local performance gtee.  This is a unique arrangement that 
the Jp banks have with Indonesia.  Also the general feeling amongst Jp 
trading companies and banks is that they are already pregnant with Indonesia 
and a little more doesn't matter.  Basically Indonesia is in the national 
security interest of Japan and therefore Jp govt and institutions will 
provide support.  I have mentioned the possibility of this to Stu to consider 
other ways to manage coal risks.  Prepay would likely be in the range of 
USD30-40 million.  Nowlan has indicated the possibility of greater volumes, 
so will work variables as we get feedback from NI/DB.  For a more detailed 
discussion see internal writeup:

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Dynegy Seems To Have Options In Enron Deal
By Rebecca Smith and Robin Sidel
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

With the stock market telling Dynegy Inc. that energy trader Enron Corp. is=
n't worth even half what Dynegy has offered to pay, analysts and investors =
are paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could ba=
rgain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal.=20
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cros=
s-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values Enron shares at $10=
.85 apiece, or a total of about $9.2 billion. But in the wake of post-agree=
ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=
tially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.=
 trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=
ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=
r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.
Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under=
 the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=
ent with Enron contains a broad ""material adverse change"" clause as well as=
 some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20
Dynegy officials performed ""due diligence"" throughout the holiday weekend, =
seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=
red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that=
 some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved=
 assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=
ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an ""=
accounting error"" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=
ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=
s.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the=
 deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=
o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=
sions ""are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=
holders."" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=
t.=20
Clauses related to a ""material adverse change,"" also known as a ""material a=
dverse effect,"" have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=
onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the e=
conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=
tions.=20
But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=
onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=
t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =
groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =
envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20
Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=
hat a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=
sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=
t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IB=
P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=
ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the =
accounting issue.=20
In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=
. Strine Jr. wrote that "" . . . the important thing is whether the company =
has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=
ions that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercia=
lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=
her than months.""=20
That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=
ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=
ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=
dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=
ld qualify as a ""material adverse change,"" or MAC.=20
A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =
is ""whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is=
 it just a hiccup,"" says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=
uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =
a court ""may be skeptical"" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agree=
ment disclosures were a surprise.=20
The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=
er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=
antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=
ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million ""topper fee"" to Dyneg=
y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20
Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces ""pending or threatened"" litigation=
 liabilities that are ""reasonably likely"" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=
e liabilities hit $3.5 billion ""an Enron material event will be deemed to h=
ave occurred,"" presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=
ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20
Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that loss=
es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=
vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=
es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by=
 officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=
enses.=20
Deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=
ron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself =
give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=
s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's =
worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=
fficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's f=
requent statement that it clearly understands Enron's businesses. Still, th=
ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne=
gy to terminate the deal if ""any representation or warranty of Enron shall =
have become untrue.""=20
Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto=
ck prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of To=
peka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundre=
ds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western's utili=
ties. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its ""duty of good fai=
th and fair dealing"" and said the New Mexico company tried to ""sabotage"" th=
e deal as the two companies' stock prices diverged. Public Service denies t=
he accusations.

The Corporation: Acquisitions
The Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy Trading

It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=
r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=
e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=
man David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=
g for more oil and gas.=20
Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=
. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's =
planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is=
 making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =
business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy=
 and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=
ile ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=
s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's ear=
nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says a=
nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming=
 a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=
il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=
vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which=
 should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=
wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have=
 margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and oth=
er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20
Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=
e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=
ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =
sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=
s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.=
=20
Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=
nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Re=
illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=
ural-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.

As Houston-based Enron Corp. imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its fina=
nces, few would have blamed Dynegy Inc. CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat=
 back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=
sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garn=
ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20
Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=
EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =
didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and th=
e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=
wer could be: Bail us out.
So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =
Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=
ffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =
p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=
nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=
llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=
o the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up=
 Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=
gy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20
Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=
00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =
that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=
I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's be=
en incredible to watch.''=20
Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=
t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=
00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =
of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control=
 an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=
.=20
That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading=
 operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company=
 to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=
rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=
ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=
ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=
er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=
000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It woul=
d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=
h Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commerc=
ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=
h as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, =
says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=
t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=
ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=
ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=
e the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=
ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities e=
xceed $3.5 billion.=20
Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not=
 a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operati=
on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=
ooked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it =
was.''=20
But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting=
 tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=
icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=
997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=
nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is=
 still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =
weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=
ecessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities=
 Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everyth=
ing of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive ear=
nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=
rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =
Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=
s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are m=
ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to iss=
ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=
hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=
ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=
ement job with the new company.=20
Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=
g and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclip=

CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? You're not alone. Here's what companies should do-=
-and what investors need to know
By Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard=
 to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=
ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=
, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=
hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It=
 was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had=
 announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hide=
ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=
nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=
clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a=
 billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's=
 net worth.=20
Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=
rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=
ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=
ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory=
 that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =
companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=
ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.
Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=
e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than =
the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=
n the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company ac=
tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=
s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=
he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =
to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=
s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stoc=
k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=
uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=
ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' s=
ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =
the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20
Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =
decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =
results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=
ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=
d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=
y of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such vers=
ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcemen=
t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=
t income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =
answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20
Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=
ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are=
 woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=
mpany's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,=
 and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone wh=
o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=
counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =
noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =
those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=
nce of ongoing operations.=20
That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calc=
ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=
mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=
ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says=
 Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =
is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =
perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20
What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=
d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=
vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=
t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=
r. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =
early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=
llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=
tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=
d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=
rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20
``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=
as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of=
 hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=
gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to=
 evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=
e better all know what we're looking at.''=20
Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=
erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street=
 is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=
rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10=
.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First=
 Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=
he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=
panies.)=20
The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use=
 First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =
modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=
g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20
How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating=
 operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =
or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=
reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=
ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conv=
entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=
ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=
llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma fo=
rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter=
 within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =
the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=
P's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pr=
o forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=
rs are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=
he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired=
 KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''=
=20
That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter end=
ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=
arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=
mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=
le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' in=
cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=
r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=
,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=
les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20
Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=
ng out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=
asure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal =
is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=
ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=
ing earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =
and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, a=
s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and=
 investors are free to ignore everything else.=20
There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =
asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=
ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=
.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =
SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=
sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =
and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=
to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=
ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=
d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net=
 income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=
ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =
five years added up to only $5 billion.=20
Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=
off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of=
 hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=
arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=
scribe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=
. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Anal=
ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=
s going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers=
 analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic-=
-a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investo=
rs to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =
eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=
ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs=
 of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=
erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=
f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=
nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of=
 an asset.=20
When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=
nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group=
 included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=
AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=
ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=
s.=20
The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=
inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =
Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=
rs shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =
to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In=
 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=
ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =
In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=
r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =
still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=
other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new ru=
les.=20
The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =
changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=
ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=
es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=
mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So=
 GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=
y's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=
s out in their unaudited press releases.=20
Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=
g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=
ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=
re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a gro=
wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide=
 missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=
ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =
investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=
ay's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.=20
The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=
ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=
stort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall in=
to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=
ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=
chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=
tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=
rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=
se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=
ir pro forma calculations.=20
Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =
of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo=
ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=
hareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the =
Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f=
ar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =
was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =
Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=
olders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=
an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=
ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=
ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =
tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains=
 in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in=
 its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=
e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer=
 maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =
spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b=
reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In=
 our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t=
here for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special=
 charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=
stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =
the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=
12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,=
 and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=
tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are=
 another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to=
 customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=
ked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating=
 its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking=
 sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame=
 the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=
n't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=
s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=
hed into write-offs.=20
Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=
xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnin=
gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or c=
harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=
t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=
n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=
ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =
that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite=
 a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they=
 can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' s=
ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20
Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=
m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=
sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =
of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =
with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20
Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =
example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=
mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=
ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =
Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=
e events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, =
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =
in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=
ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors a=
re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy=
 doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=
anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=
flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=
e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=
s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value=
 falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=
ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=
o take more charges.=20
But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=
here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=
aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =
``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=
ing up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Profe=
ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''=20
While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=
es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=
ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =
investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=
funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to=
 plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB=
 Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FF=
O is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than=
 another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''=20
There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=
store GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=
ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income=
 from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens s=
ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they=
 bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their=
 press releases with the SEC.=20
At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =
numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=
bers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment=
 of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=
n is more important to investors.

High-Gloss Glossary
Companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =
on
their results. Here's what those terms mean:
DEFINING EARNINGS:
NET INCOME
The bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=
P).
Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securitie=
s &
Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.
OPERATING EARNINGS
An adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=
ted
to the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure
called ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it=
 is
not an audited figure.
CORE EARNINGS
Another term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=
e
calculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the
preparer wishes.
PRO FORMA EARNINGS
The 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime=
s
excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The
granddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that
carried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely
quoted.
ADJUSTED EARNINGS
A new term for pro forma.
DEFINING COSTS:
SPECIAL CHARGES
A general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and
therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.
ASSET IMPAIRMENTS
Charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to it=
s
current market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on intern=
al
venture-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks at
inflated prices.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS
The same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the
premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible asset=
s
acquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because o=
f a
change in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill
amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair value=
s.
RESTRUCTURING RESERVES
An accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down=
 a
portion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs an=
d
if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.
WRITE-DOWN
Lowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is
often excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cos=
t
long ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cash
costs, such as investment-banking fees.

What did the company earn? That's the most basic question an investor can e=
ver ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=
s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=
orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=
ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =
New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=
ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=
ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=
g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=
rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =
clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=
rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the=
 global marketplace (page 76).=20
The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=
sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=
odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=
s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=
t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=
od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=
rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.
A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GA=
AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=
me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=
perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there=
 are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=
ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5=
00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=
tandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=
P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =
It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =
and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agenc=
y Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=
) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=
rnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=
s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=
r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,=
 and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=
uild on. The accounting anarchy has to end.

Back in Enron's heyday, one of its rising stars was Rebecca Mark. Nicknamed=
 ``Mark the Shark'' because of her ferocious ambition, she made her name in=
 the early '90s building the energy giant's international operations, inclu=
ding the now-troubled Dabhol power plant in India. Once rumored to be a suc=
cessor to Enron CEO Ken Lay, she resigned from Enron in August, 2000, after=
 two years of heading Enron's ailing water company spin-off, Azurix.=20
These days, as Enron struggles to stay afloat, Mark-Jusbasche (who hyphenat=
ed her name with that of her husband of two years) is watching the action f=
rom the sidelines. And she'd like to keep it that way. ``I'm very surprised=
 and saddened by [what has happened at Enron], and I wish them all the best=
,'' she says. Beyond that, Mark-Jusbasche, 47, is not much interested in ta=
lking about Enron, which is being acquired by a small rival after a spectac=
ular Wall Street flameout. Mark left Enron with millions of dollars worth o=
f Enron shares, although she says she has sold them since.
Mark-Jusbasche spends most of her time serving on advisory boards, both at =
Yale and Harvard business schools, as well as the school where her 16-year-=
old twin sons from a previous marriage are sophomores.=20
In her spare time, she seeks out opportunities for investing. Currently, Ma=

ly dear to her heart: looking into expanding her cattle ranches. She now ow=

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron still optimistic of averting fina=
ncial meltdown.
By ANDREW HILL and SHEILA MCNULTY.

11/26/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron said yesterday it was still expecting outside investors to inject $50=
0m to $1bn into the group, as talks continued to avoid a financial meltdown=
 at the energy trading group.=20
Dynegy, whose rescue bid for its Houston rival is crucial to Enron's surviv=
al, spent last week's Thanksgiving holiday and the weekend reviewing Enron'=
s operations and finances.
Dynegy said it remained ""optimistic for the potential of the merger to be c=
ompleted, and in the time-frame we originally announced - six to nine month=
s"".=20
Enron's fate depends on a delicate, unofficial pact between its lenders, Dy=
negy, and credit ratings agencies, which have resisted downgrading the grou=
p's debt while the deal is pending.=20
If the pact stays in place, at least $500m is likely to be invested in Enro=
n by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, Enron's key lenders and advisers. A fur=
ther $500m is being sought from private equity firms.=20
But if Dynegy pulls out of the deal, the cash infusion could be put in jeop=
ardy and the ratings agencies could downgrade the debt to junk, triggering =
debt repayments across a network of partnerships and off-balance-sheet vehi=
cles linked to Enron.=20
Enron confirmed yesterday that it was still seeking additional liquidity fr=
om new equity investors, but would not discuss their identities.=20
Enron's crisis of confidence became more acute last week when the shares fe=
ll from $9 to $4.74 following a regulatory filing that revealed the extent =
of the group's debt burden.=20
Completion of a $1bn secured credit line from JPM Chase and Citigroup, and =
the postponement of a $690m notes repayment due tomorrow were not sufficien=
t to prop up the share price. The bonds also fell to levels consistent with=
 a potential bankruptcy filing.=20
The slide in the share price has encouraged speculation that Dynegy is prep=
aring to renegotiate its all-stock bid, now worth $9.3bn, compared with Enr=
on's market value of $3.5bn.=20
But people close to Enron say renegotiation of the deal would not in itself=
 have any impact on the energy group's finances. Latest news, www.ft.com/en=

Schwab Chief's Main Theme: Diversification
By Lynnette Khalfani
Dow Jones Newswires

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- More than two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many=
 investors remain edgy. But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has=
 shown remarkable resilience.=20
Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert=
s say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep =
their wits about them.
In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o=
f Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera=
ge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista=
kes they should avoid.=20
Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20
In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi=
nk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's per=
ceptions about risk have changed?=20
I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=
e risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing =
in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=
tions]. There's risk in real estate, too.=20
So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=
r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=
arned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock a=
n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20
What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? T=
hat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh=
anistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in =
the markets?=20
I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W=
e were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin=
g is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this co=
untry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th=
e strength of our government.=20
There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've h=
ad many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about a=
ll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret=
ty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't ge=
t better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully=
 before the economy goes up.=20
There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resourc=
e and buying power that's definitely available for new investments.=20
What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past =
two or so months?=20
They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn=
't use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After =
Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20
Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going=
 to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o=
f fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: ""Thi=
s is still the time to invest.""=20
My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, ""I just don=
't want to be in the stock market at all."" And it's just the time that peop=
le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20
Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post=
er child of the last cycle. Or people say, ""I'll get back in [the market] w=
hen I see the economy turn around."" Well, by the time they see that, it's t=
oo late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.

Enron Pursuing a Cash Infusion Energy: Company is seeking as much as $1bill=
ion as it tries to shore up its endangered acquisition by Dynegy.
From Bloomberg News

Los Angeles Times

Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. said talks are continuing with potential investors f=
or an infusion of as much as $1 billion as the biggest energy trader tries =
to avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by Dynegy Inc.=20
An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened finances may prompt =
Dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction, which is=
 valued at $23 billion in stock and assumed debt.
Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in cash but would=
n't divulge details. ""We are not going to discuss the particulars of who we=
 are talking to,"" Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Sunday.=20
Shares of the Houston company fell by 48% in the last three trading session=
s on the New York Stock Exchange. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the s=
tock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to pay in th=
e acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will g=
o through as planned.=20
Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., Blacksto=
ne Group and Carlyle Group for a private equity investment, said industry a=
nalyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.=20
The firms have declined to comment.=20
In a conference call Nov. 14, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon=
 said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to=
 receive $500 million to $1 billion from those sources.=20
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690-millio=
n note due this week, gaining more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy=
 Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was ""encouraged"" by the commitment to=
 extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $450-million credit fa=
cility. He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.=20
Enron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from ChevronTexaco Inc.=
 as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In return, Dynegy received preferr=
ed stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural G=
as Co. pipeline. Under the deal's terms, if Dynegy and Enron fail to merge,=
 Dynegy can acquire the pipeline company.=20
But Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy's right to the pipeline =
might be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc=
., which accepted the asset as collateral for $1billion in loans to Enron.=
=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's attempts to secu=
re financing or whether more cash for Enron is a condition of keeping the m=
erger alive.=20
Enron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investi=
gation of the company, which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratin=
gs cut.=20
The company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week ago that it has=
 less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left.

Dynegy Optimistic That Enron Merger Will Succeed - FT

11/26/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) remains optimistic, after further re=
view of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) finances last week, that it will be able to buy=
 the company, the Financial Times reported Monday.=20
Dynegy said that it, ""remained optimistic for the potential of the merger t=
o be completed, and in the time frame we originally announced - six to nine=
 months,"" the FT reported.
Critical investment in Enron by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup will procee=
d only if an unofficial pact between Enron, Dynegy, and Enron's lenders and=
 credit rating agencies remains intact, the report said. Investment from th=
ese two is likely to total between $500 million and $1 billion, while Enron=
 continues to look for a further $500 million from private equity firms.=20
The deal suffered a setback last week, when a regulatory filing revealed a =
greater debt burden than some investors had realized. Enron's share price f=
ell following the report, to $4.74 from $9.00.=20
A $1 billion secured credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase and an extension of=
 a $690 million repayment due Tuesday weren't enough to keep the share pric=
e from falling. This led to speculation that Dynegy was considering renegot=
iating its all-stock bid, now at $9.3 billion, compared with Enron's market=
 value of $3.5 billion, said the report.=20
Renegotiating the deal wouldn't have any impact on Enron's finances, unname=
d sources told the FT.=20
But if Dynegy pulled out of the deal altogether, there might be no cash inf=
usion from J.P. Morgan chase and Citigroup. Credit ratings agencies could t=

Hi Jonathan, 
Our compliance department has just contacted us back regarding your request to hold a small cash account here to pay your RSP fees each year.  Their suggestion is that we sell the Janus mutual funds and convert this money to US funds then transfer it to your Dane Rascher account in the US because you are now a US resident and the Investment regulations want it handled that way.
You could simply send us a cheque for the RSP fees when we notify you each June. 
I hope you had a good holiday season, did you get home for Christmas?  Let me know by phone if we can proceed as suggested above and I will look after it for you in the new year.  Thanks.

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved (again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?

Anyway, everything we well, for the most part.  As far as Alliance gas is 
concerned, the only new information is that the Aux Sable commissioning 
process will not start until Wednesday (last estimate) per Anne Buschal.  So 
make sure to mention to Hunter on Monday, as everyone else should already 
know about it.  Anne's number is 403-517-6270.  She will be calling each

What a very pleasant surprise to hear from you in the middle of the day!!!  
Things here are a little exciting, they are asking us to spend the night in 
one of the hotels downtown, as the streets are supposed to ice over tonight.  
So quite naturally, nobody's mind is on work, it's on the weather.  So 
needless to say, I have a little bit of time on my hands.  The boys are going 
over to Grandma Springer's house tonight to spend the night and Todd and I 
will just stay downtown.  I understand that you guys had some bad weather as 
well, I know Mom was out of school.

I will definitely go and get the Tekno dog for the kids, they will enjoy it 
so much.  Kendall celebrated his 2nd birthday yesterday and had fun.  Todd 
bought him a mini basketball goal and he really thinks he's a big boy now.  
It's really cute.  On the other hand, Jordan was feeling a little neglected 
because of Kendall's cake and presents, but he's okay.  It was just  a new 
experience, him not getting anything while his brother gets new toys.

Anyway, I'll send your tape.

See you later and I hope you're still taking your medicine on a timely basis

Love

Please see the message below from Neil Davies.  Neil works in HR under David Oxley and was instructed to call Mr. Reitze last night.  I asked him not to mention the dinner with you.  A problem that is coming up is that the interviews are required to run late (8:30ish) and the person that has been pushed to the end of that line is Hunter.  What are your thoughts on this and is him going to dinner with the two of you a possibility at all?  If you need me to help with reservations or anything, please let me know as I would be happy to help.

Also note that Greg Whalley would like to meet with him.  Eddie does not want to come in any earlier than 4.  That can be a problem.  Maybe another thought is to have him come in twice, but I am afraid if we pick that option, it may be tough to get him back.

Anyway, look over this message, tell me your thoughts and after I hear back from you, I will arrange the interview schedule for Eddie on the 23rd.

2084,"John,  Attached is the Transco guaranty with further revisions.  The 
following items of note were revised.

1.  Transco added language stating that this is a performance guaranty.  
Enron will only provide a payment guaranty.  Enron does not have the means to 
ensure performance by the LLC.  Thus the language needs to clearly identify 
that this is a payment guaranty.  As long as Transco gets paid for the 
transport, I am not sure why this matters.

2.  Transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their 
tariff.  Putting late payment interest in the guaranty would give Transco the 
ability to recover double interest on late payments.  Thus, the interest 
language in the guaranty was removed.  

Please review the revised guaranty.  I would be happy to discuss these issues 
with Transco's attorney's at their convenience.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

tarrif to read that a release done at the full negotiated contract rate is 
the same as the maximum rate. Therefore we can release at the $.12 rate.  He 
also stated that he would begin the approval process with the banks for the 
release but thought that there would be no problem with Huber's credit.  He 
did state that the bank approval timing was out of his control but he would 
try to expedite it. In addition, he felt that the best way to do the release 
was to do it  with the first bidder meeting minimum terms and have Huber 
ready to take it.  He said that it would not have to be noticed ahead of time 
so noone would know that it was going  to hit the board.

2112,"Last week I sent copies of the product description and GTC to Becky Cantrell 
(regulatory) for comments and she did make a couple of suggestions which I 
agree with.  First, in both the description and the original GTC we refer to 
an open season; however, this product is for capacity release, which would 
not be subject to an open season--only bidding.  So, Gerald, unless you have 
some objection that we have overlooked, I believe it is appropriate to remove 
the words ""or open season"" in the product description.  Regarding the GTC, 
since we were planning on eliminating Paragraph 3 anyway, which had the open 
season reference, I think that one is already taken care of.

The other question she had is how we would define the following terms and how 
they would be made a part of the contract:  Reference Pipeline, Rate

Could you tell me how to proceed on this deal.  This differs a bit from the deal that was originally discussed but seems to make sense.  Please disregard the second attachment at it relates to a modification of the Storage Agreement that has not been discussed (and one that we are not willing to make).  Also, the letter as drafted does not contemplate (but we will insist on) placement of the proceeds from the sale of gas associated with pre-petition amounts into escrow with some third party until some resolution is reached on those amounts.

By way of example, if Centana is owed $100k pre-petition, $150k post-petition and has $1,000,000 worth of gas in the ground, Centana would remit (i) $100k to an escrow agent for subsequent resolution and disposition and (ii) $750k to ENA ($900k offset by the $150k for post petition obligations).

The key issue is what level of approval is needed to do this.  A strong case could be made for Cash Committee only because no pre-petition amounts are being paid (and no resolution of those amounts is being reached).  Rather, we are just converting the commodity to cash when the market is higher than it has been over the past several weeks.

Another good reason for doing this is that after the cavern is empty, we can argue that we are not using it and therefore no more post-petition obligations continue to accrue following the consummation of the deal (while we decide to accept or reject).

Please advise at your earliest possible convenience.

Thanks

Stuart

I spoke with the commercial contact, Royal Edmondson (713-207-3384) this morning.  He was aware that they have not paid and eluded to the fact that Enron has not paid Tennessee's Nov01 transportation and storage invoice, which we are agent for Entex.

I also spoke with Ken Armstrong (713-207-3365) who proposed that Entex would pay Enron the commodity portion of the invoice and pay the transportation charges directly to Tennessee.  I asked him to let me clear that with our attorney so that we didn't do anything to void the agency status.  Ken also said he would consider paying us our full invoice amount if he was convinced that their transportation invoice was paid.

Gerald, please call me ASAP so we can resolve this and receive payment.

out what Chris has in mind and politely told him that I concerns about it 
and he needed to go talk to his dad and bro about what they wanted to do. 
Chris proposed that his individual design company buy the spot for business 
use and maybe his friends could shoot a buck under it too and pay him a 
little back. May work I said, but opening weekend would need to be members 
only, he suggested that his friends could alternate coming on opening 
weekend: which I interpreted as Chris fencing spot 8a and 8b for his friends 
Toby and Bobby to pay 1k a piece. I told him that was likely unacceptable, 
to discuss with family and get back to me...

I then called chet to beg one last time and he was receptive. BMC looks to 
be doing better he says. He was going to talk to Molly about it and would 
like to look at how co. does over the next quarter.
Please call and encourage him to commit.

                               OPEN SEASON


Overview

Columbia Gulf hereby provides notice that it is conducting an open season to

Purpose of the Open Season

Columbia Gulf is conducting this open season to comply with a Stipulation and
Consent Agreement approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
in Docket No. CP93-736.  Under the FERC orders, Columbia Gulf must hold an open

Corporation at the time of Order No. 636 restructuring (October 31, 1993).

Details

* The open season period begins at 5 p.m. Central Time on October 5, 2001 and
ends at 5 p.m. Central Time on November 4, 2001.

2159,"Thanks Rogers.   I think Steve would fit in with our group well.   I probably need to wait at least a week to let the dust settle on our own people issues.    My guess is we will end up losing 2-3 people and outside candidates then become viable.

Attached is my current resume along with a background summary:

I joined Electronic Data Systems (EDS) over 12 years ago and have supported
numerous accounts in diverse industries both in a technical and business
role.  I would like to gain exposure in the energy industry and do not have
an opportunity to do so within EDS. As a result, I've decided to seek a new
opportunity.   The following profile may be helpful in identifying potential
opportunities:

Desired Position(s):	Application Analyst, Business Analyst,
Programmer/Analyst

Desired Duties and Responsibilities:

*	Perform in-depth analysis and technical support of systems and
software products
*	Identify industry and market trends, develop and execute appropriate
strategies

 PHI  Updated 10/24/01 Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to pla=
y in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.   Ron Dixon=
 , WR NYG  Updated 10/24/01 Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained =
ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.  Joe =
Jurevi! ci! us , WR NYG  Updated 10/24/01 Ike Hilliard regained his startin=
g position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jureviciu=
s was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be us=
eless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to star=
ting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this sea=
son. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game whil=
e Toomer stood on the sidelines.   Reggie Swinton , WR DAL  Updated 10/24/0=
1 Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sund=
ay's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday=
 and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be av=
ailable,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini an! d ! Raghib Isma=
il will get more playing time in his absence.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL  Upd=
ated 10/24/01 Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game again=
st the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playi=
ng. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited pr=
actice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that=
 it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head c=
oach Dave Campo.     Darrin Chiaverini , WR DAL  Updated 10/24/01 Chiaverin=
i practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the =
Cardinals. ! He! is recovering from a left knee injury.   Raghib Ismail , W=
R DAL  Updated 10/24/01 Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced =
Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.=
   Ricky Watters , RB SEA  Updated 10/23/01 According to the Tacoma News Tr=
ibune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to t=
he starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or=
 longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I wo=
uld be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our =
best player when! h! e got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played w=
ell. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If yo=
u have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your=
 team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander do=
wn the stretch.   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA  Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable=
 to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB j=
ob to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this poin=
t.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA  Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seaha=
wks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the=
 Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Has=
selbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorabl=
e matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fan! ta! sy perspective, so don't use him t=
his week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ  Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Ch=
rebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an M=
RI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday =
against the Rams.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA  Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monda=
y's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at =
Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  La=
mar Smith , RB MIA  Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to a=
n ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be=
 afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC  Updated 10/23/01 Chie=
fs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chr=
is Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you u=
se either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imp=
osing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome=
 Pathon , WR IND  Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight gam=
e Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this =
week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND  Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable =
for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend y=
ou use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN  Updated =
10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his =
comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not deci=
ded whether they will activate him. He will work in p! ra! ctice this week =
and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't =
recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain =
he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick D=
unn , RB TB  Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn d=
oesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't prac=
tice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday =
against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI  Updated 10/23/01 Staley started =
Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carr=
ied the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the gam=
e by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in t=
he game. ! At! this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consisten=
t Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a so=
lid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN  Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a n=
eck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinn=
ey , TE TEN  Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report be=
cause of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game=
.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN  Updated 10/23/01 D! ys! on is recovering from a t=
humb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. =
He is expected to participate in practice.   Eddie George , RB TEN  Updated=
 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected t=
o play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 10/23/01 McNai=
r is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. Ho=
wever, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN=
  Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem i=
n his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week.=
 Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect =
Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.=
   Damon Jones , TE JAC  Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume pract=
icing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not=
 require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC  Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been =
ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his! s! tatus for next wee=
k's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they in=
crease his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told=
 The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to =
play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can =
make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor=
 has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis=
 Northcutt , WR CLE  Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because =
of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action ne=
xt week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL  Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday bu=
t head coach ! Br! ian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that=
 the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the l=

h some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Water Boys Updated 12/23/=
01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of=
 his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham does=
n't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be sig=
ned off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 re=
ceiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Sm=
ith  , RB NE - CYSWC Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 ya=
rds and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AF=
C and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN=
 - Money Shots Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering fr=
om back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the s=
econd half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - CYSWC=
 Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played =
in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He pl=
ayed with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia=
 might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be =

 of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - CYSWC Updated 12/21/01 A ban=

n him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Water Boys Upd=
ated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1=

 STL - Team T-Bone Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams =
to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of th=
e way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 12/21/01 Gannon h=
as been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many =
title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - The Repla=

nt this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't =

2177,"that motherboard does look sweet!  why the scsi drives though?  personally, i want to find a RAID card that can handle RAID5 (everything i've seen is 0,1,or 0+1) and then link up a bunch of smallish IDE drives - if the controller is good, you don't need super fast and expensive drives, so you get speed and redundancy.  as i look at hardware, i can't believe how much enron was paying compaq for hardware - it's amazing.  as for parts, what do you think about ordering from the cheapest U.S. source and paying duty?

             I have not really been MIA just taking some time off.  I received an offer to trade for UBS which I have accepted. Our desk will be very small to start out.  Brad did not accept his offer and is moving to Kansas City to work for Aquila.  Pete quit before he was made an offer to work for a bank in New York City.  I am so happy for him.

            You must have ESP!  Last night I told Dick I needed to call  and 
see how you were and what you were doing for Christmas.  We have to work on 
the 26th (even though it's an ENE holiday) so we would have to come back on 
Christmas day if we went home.    We decided to stay in Houston.  I'm so glad 
you are going home but to tell the truth I feel like you do about traveling 
during the holidays.  Nothing new with us - just about finished decorating 
the house but sometimes I think I'll never get done.   I have not bought a 
thing for Dick yet - still do not know what to get him!  I guess I'll be one 
of those crazies out shopping on Christmas Eve.  We went home for 
Thanksgiving and I caught a cold that I'm just now getting over.  Will you be 
coming to Houston in the near future?  If you do you are more than welcome to 
stay with us while your here - we would love to have you!  Better go but 
let's meet like this more often!  Take care and have a very Merry Christmas!",Dick,,

I spoke with Robin, and from what we know Canada officializes one calc that 
includes both their price and basis positions.  (Calc is represented by the

the post id. (It appears that it is only the PRC book that comes through, the 
BAS book is represented by the red ""x"", however it is in the same calc.).  
Since the Canadian post id only includes two books ids,  the Benchmark group 
manually assign the same post id to the basis book, that way both books get 
picked up.

Does this help?

2.  What pricing does the 20 year project model show that we need?
 - We also need power curve from year 3 to 20 to calculate Calpine's merchant 
revenue.
 - We are currently refining the model regarding IDC, residual value, etc.

3.  What additional information do you need from me to complete your analysis?
 - Unit contingency or liquidated damage protection
 - Exact location for power and gas

Once we find out unit contingency and location, I will get the pricing with a 
couple of scenarios as you asked: 
 - Flat and annual capacity for 3 and 5 year
 - Power curve from year 3 to 20

2312,"As you know, Enron does not own transmission facilities and therefore is not 
subject to the FERC code of conduct rules with respect to functional 
separation of generation and transmission.

However, when Enron established 3 control areas in the SERC region in 
June-July 1999, a separate legal entity (Enron SE Corp) was created to 
provide the reliability/control area operation function for Enron's Southeast 
generation assets.  Although functional separation is not required by FERC, 
Enron chose to do so because marketing/trading is indeed separate from the 
control area reliability function at Enron.  Additionally, Enron SE Corp. (as 
a certified control area) is entitled to ISN and IDC data that is subject to 
NERC confidentiality provisions and cannot be disclosed and/or utilized by 
the merchant function.

In order to protect the IDC and ISN information consistent with the NERC 
Confidentiality Agreement (for ISN data) and the OATI/NERC Non-Disclosure 
Agreement (for IDC data), only employees within the control area reliability 
function have access to the data.   To highlight the importance of this 
confidential information, verbal and written correspondence has been provided 
by Enron's legal and regulatory counsel to each control area employee with 
specific instructions to keep all required information confidential as set 
forth in the NERC Confidentiality Agreement.

I hope this adequately answers your question.  If you have any additional 
questions, please feel free to call me at 713-853-5035.

Mark:

I assume that you and Richard are very familiar with the day-to-day 
developments in the heavily publicized FERC case involving the investigation 
by FERC of El Paso's sale of pipeline capacity into the CA market to its 
merchant arm last year that CA officials have partly blamed for the spike in 
gas and power prices.  As you know, this is the case where the highest 
executives of El Paso recently were called to testify at FERC.

An article in this morning's New York Times (which begins on page 1), in 
discussing El Paso's significant earnings generated by the El Paso merchant 
arm from the pipeline capacity purchase, says that the parties with which El 
Paso hedged its position also made sizeable profits.  The article notes that 
about half of El Paso's trades were with Enron ""according to people present 
at the briefings El Paso officials have given to California officials.""  
While this probably is not surprising in light of our size and breadth in the 
market, it nonetheless is made to sound somewhat sinister, and my sense is 
that it is just another potential barb for the CA officials to throw at us.  
Since the article quotes a response from Mark Palmer (in which he suggests 
that Enron, in turn, likely would have resold the capacity and would not have 
realized the benefit of the rising market), I assumed that you were aware of 
it, but I thought I would err on the side of putting an extra e-mail in your 
in-box.

will get the originals by Thursday.

I would appreciate Bernard's office advising me by the close of business in 
Paris Thursday whether they have received this package.

Parenthetically, I repeat my two prior requests that I be advised as soon as 
possible what qualifications are necessary for a liquidator, so that we can 
speedily substitute someone in and for the place of John Echols, who has 
signed the originals we are now using only with my promise that we would 
speedily find a substitute.  Based on Bernard's advice, I told Echols that 
this could be done within 60 days.  Echols signed the documents on December 
5.  I accordingly anticipate that you and Bernard will be working with me to 
get the substitution accomplished by no later than Monday, February 5, 2001.

2385,"Pearson's June 9, 2000 letter questions why $.10 or $.11 were deducted from
the Transco and Koch indices in connection with the sale of Mobile Bay Block
870 gas.

We responded in detail on October 3.  In addition to those answers, we
should keep in mind that market value cannot necessarily be calculated with
mathematical precision.  Market value is often described in terms of a
range.  Indeed, the Inside FERC's Gas Market Reports publishes not only an
index price, but also a range of prices for each pipeline pricing point.

In looking at the applicable indices for those two pipelines for some of the
sample months, it is clear that, if $.10 or $.11 were deducted from the
index price, then the resulting price would still be in the range as
published by Inside FERC.

For example, in December 1996, the Transco Zone 3 index price was $3.82.
The published range was $3.38 to $3.95.  So adjusting the index by 10 cents
still keeps you well within the range.

Similarly, for the 1996 Koch So. La. index.  The index price was $3.82.  The
range was $3.55 to $3.94.  Again, an 11 cent adjustment is still well within
the range.

A quick review of other months shows that sometimes the range was narrower,
and the adjustments would take you outside the range.  Nonetheless, we
should keep this background information in mind in case Justice continues to
pursue this point.

In preparation for the Outlook migration, we have come up with the basic

2401,"Yesterday, George Caplan and I attended a hearing before Judge Kuhl on the
Committee's ex parte application shortening time to hear its motion to
enforce the stipulation with the state regarding rejection of the claims
before the VCB.

After hearing brief argument, the Judge made it very clear that the State
needed to sign the stipulation.  In fact, the Judge waited around all day
until the State signed a stipulation (which will be submitted to the VCB
shortly) whereby the State agreed that the consolidated claims pending
before the VCB should be summarily rejected as unduly complex and that all
administrative remedies regarding the inverse condemnation claims on the
commandeered contracts have been exhausted.

The Judge, however, was reluctant to enter our proposed order (which
declared that the VCB proceedings were moot and that the parties no longer
needed to participate in those proceedings).

(According to the ISO, Amendment 27 has been accepted for filing, suspended=

and set for hearing.  Settlement negotiations are ongoing.  (Is Enron a par=

Specific Proposed Changes

Clarification of Wheeling Access Charge Quantity

The ISO proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the=
=20
determination of the Wheeling Access Charge, the proper calculation is to u=
se=20
transmission facility ownership and Entitlements less all Encumbrances. =20
Encumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing=20
contracts.  This is how the ISO is currently calculating this charge and th=
e=20
ISO appears to be using this filing to codify this method.

New HV TAC Rates Using Year-1 of the ISO=01,s Proposed Transmission Methodo=
logy

The current Access Charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates=
=20
based on the Transmission Revenue Requirement of the Original Participating=
=20
TO.  Because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the TO, they=
=20
are known as =01&license plate=018 rates.  Under Amendment No. 27, this met=
hodology=20
continues in effect until a New Participating TO joins the ISO.  Once that=
=20
occurs, the Access Charge for High Voltage Transmission Facilities will be=
=20
assessed based on the combined High Voltage Transmission Revenue Requiremen=
ts=20
of all the Participating TOs in each TAC Area.

The filing claims to implement an already-approved transition formula where=
in=20
new members of the ISO will pay a rate that is a mix license place and syst=
em=20
average embedded costs.  The goal is that after 10 years there will be only=

high voltage access charge. The following table shows that under the curren=

method, which would be a 90/10 split of license-plate/system-average charge=

Last I remember, we were not too concerned about the utilities filing in

2411,"PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT

Nicole and Bob:

This will confirm our telephone conference today regarding the issue whether 
Enron Metals should be sending out 180-day notice of contest letters to the 
various carriers who have tried to collect unpaid freight from Enron Metals 
as a result of the reported insolvency of ICTS, Enron Metals' former shipping 
agent.

Bob advised that the carrier's claims he has received in the New York office 
total in the neighborhood of $30,000-$35,000.  Of those, three carriers 
apparently have claims of $5,400, $16,000 and $13,210.  With respect to those 
three carriers, Bob's office has sent some type of letter indicating that 
Enron Metals already paid ICTS for this shipment and that those carriers 
should look to ICTS for payment.  The remaining claims are reportedly 
relatively small (and Bob will be sending me his file containing those claims 
shortly).

Nicole advised that the claims she has received in the Montreal office total 
in the neighborhood of $40,000.  Close to 90% of those reportedly involve 
shipments that were completed prior to the end of April.  It is Nicole's 
understanding that she and her office were still a part of Barclay's until 
the end of April.  She is not, however, aware of how responsibility would 
have been apportioned between Barclay's and MG Metals at the time for claims 
such as these.  Nicole will shortly send me an e-mail which sets forth what 
bills concern shipments that occurred after the end of April.  No notice of 
contest letter of any kind has been sent to these carriers.

Both of you indicated that the telephone calls you had been receiving from 
the carriers has tapered off.

Based on the foregoing, I recommended to you, and you agreed, that the best 
strategy was to ""let sleeping dogs lie""--i.e., not to attract attention to 
Enron Metals by sending out 180-day notice of contest letters to the various 
carriers.  The risk here is that if one or more of these carriers does file 
suit, you may not be able to assert any defense on behalf of MG Metals, such 
as a late or inaccurate bill (and I have not researched your bills to 
determine whether such defenses exist).  Should a carrier file suit, you 
would probably be liable for the principle and interest, along with 
attorneys' fees.  

However, given our preliminary impression that MG Metals is secondarily 
liable on these bills if ICTS defaults, and the relevatively small size of 
most of these bills, I think a ""reactive"" rather than ""proactive"" defensive 
strategy makes sense. 

Nicole and I agreed that I would run down exactly how Barclay's and MG Metals 
decided to apportion liability for charges such as these at the time of that 
transaction.  By copy of this e-mail, I am asking Marcus if he knows the 
right person to advise me on this (or if he has access to the relevant 
documents).

I will continue to keep you advised.

2414,"Ana Paula, thanks for keeping after me on this.

We have decided to rely on Ms. Cunha as the company representative to be 
present in court. This will avoid the need for an official, court appointed 
tramslator. She will be supported by Randy Pais, Nate Neuman or others as 
needed either from Houston or traveling to Brazil as needed. The SCC expat 
presence in Brazil will be greatly diminished in the next several weeks. 

Please copy Ms. Cunha  Mr. Randy Pais and Mr. Richard Sanders on all 
correspondence related to this matter. Randy Pais is the internal 
transactional lawyer at EEOS/SCC working the Cuiaba project; Richard Sanders 
is the internal litigation management lawyer at Enron Wholesale who supports 
our business unit.

I want to make sure I understand what is meant by the power of attorney and 
company representative letter. Are these the documents that appoint Ms. Cunha 
as the SCC company representative for the purposes of this matter? Sami,  if 
this is right I would have no objections for you signing these documents, but 
you don't have any position with SCC. Weren't these to be give n to Nate 
Neuman for him to have executed at the SCC office in Cuiaba?

Ana Paula, is it possible to e-mail or fax the documents to us here, and for 
us to signand fax back, or does the court need originals?

2420,"At the hearing today before Judge Kuhl, she ordered the coordination, but
has set Sacramento as the venue.

She took the bench with that as her tentative, pointing to the second
paragraph of Govt. C. 955, which provides the state the opportunity to
remove non-takings cases to Sacramento -- an argument that the State did
NOT make.  She also mentioned that the State's action in Sacramento is the
only one that attempted to bring in all of the parties.  She found that the
convenience to the parties was not significant, since they seemed to be all
over.  She also found that the matter could be sent back from Sacramento if
the judge, after completing the legal issues, felt that trials in SF or LA
would be better.

George argued for CalPX.  Linda Callison argued for PG&E, stating their
preference of SF, but LA over Sacramento.  Reliant and Williams argued for
LA.  Richard Williams argued for the State.  We went through a couple of
rounds with very little questioning by the judge.  The only issue that
caught her attention was George's argument that CCP 401(2) provides that a
party sued by the state can remove the action to their county for trial, as
long as the AG has an office there.  She questioned the interplay between
that section and the one she cited, but did not take up George's offer to
brief the issue.

Because her decision seemed to be without any serious reason, it was out of
character for her, suggesting that other issues were at play.  She broke
the argument at one point to suggest that all of the arguments about where
the property was located were really cover for the underlying reality that
all of the parties had reasons to like or hate particular judges in the
various venues that they were trying to get or avoid.  We speculate that
the judges in the LA complex panel did not want this one and she is sending
it elsewhere.  We don't think it is political, since she is no friend of
Gray Davis.

2456,"Good Morning Diana,

I just spoke with Duong and we don't think it will be a huge issue for Enpower.  Here are my thoughts:

1.  Enpower stores dates & times in GMT.
2.  On each schedule strip, we identify the time zone.  Portland users usually select PPT.  Pacific Prevailing Time is smart enough to properly assign either PST or PDT depending on the date.  If the date falls on the long-day or short-day, Enpower will split the strip into 2 strips based on the time the deal flows.
3.  I am assuming that WSCC would standardize on PST.  We would just need to run a mass change SQL statement to convert all the PPT and PDT schedule strips to PST.  

Anyway, I'll be back in Portland on Friday.  Please let me know if you have any available time to discuss further.

Thanks,  David Poston

2513,"Susan, Thanks for the draft exhibit. My first comment is that the general
approach taken by Socal tends to ""generalize"" the Socal receipt points by
noting all upstream pipeline market possibilities. I think this is helpful
in that we should stay focused on the Socal structure and not worry about
upstream mismatches. All receipt points apparently are mismatched so they
all are similarly situated. It would therefore be of no particular use for
the ALJ to dwell on this topic to long in this proceeding.

Some additional comments;

Wheeler Ridge - Incoming Interstate Capacity : ok , K/M testimony
unchallenged at 1 bcf/d
    - Take Away : PG&E No.Cal assumes full displacement volumes and
bi-directional flow
                            capacity of at least 200 mmcfd
                            K/M to PG&E - list 200 mmcfd , I know it has
physically done over         350 mmcfd
        Hector Rd. - ok
        K/M to Las Vegas should be closer to 200 mmcfd

Hector Road - Strike the asterisk and comment concerning Hector deliveries
limited by TW. Additional information not required.

No. Needles,South Needles, Blythe - OK ., Socal doesn't mention Sempra's
Mexico project

No mentions - Southern Trails Pipeline, All American or any other announced
but not in service pipeline project

probably work.

The question is not what is designed to ""serve"" the SoCalGas market, but
what is the upstream capacity flowing to SoCal's interconnection points
that could theoretically serve SoCalGas if there was no limitation on
SoCal's takeaway capacity.  Based on this, Norman's exhibit seems OK unless
there is some physical system constraint (besides SoCal's takeaway) that
would limit potential inflow into the SoCalGas system.

The problem with SoCal's last exhibit is that there is still no
clarification of whether the upstream gas could flow into ANY ONE of the
take away pipelines.  Maybe this could be clarified somehow (in a footnote)?

2522,"Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.

There are a couple of important changes from the last draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
""market-based.""  At FERC, the term ""market-based"" has connotations of having 
to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack 
market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the 
legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in 
feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a 
separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the 
filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved.

The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) 
is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every 
shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have 
to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other 
words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply 
execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two 
advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate 
theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case.

I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to 
discuss the following topics:

1)  Your comments and questions on this draft,
2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract 
work from a logistical standpoint,
3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and
4)  Comments received from shippers thus far.

time.

",Mary Kay Miller,,
2525,"Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a 
summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA 
could purchase an ""out of the money"" call option essentially cost free, since 
its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds 
from ENA's ability to then ""move the market"" through the establishment of the 
long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested 
that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the 
marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to 
other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with 
ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for 
other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first 
pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as 
possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but 
rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier 
suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference 
between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if 
the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  

TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a 
marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable 
record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale 
of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily 
include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have 
serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing 
affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that 
applies to all interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will 
constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as 
such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's 
position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the 
transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment 
will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the 
option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso 
as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program 
would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why 
some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would 
create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps 
because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the 
underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make 
hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to 
placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for 
capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require 
TW to do so in a final order.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of 
September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC 
filing by mid-September.

2541,"You asked whether current contract approval procedures require the marketers 
to get Legal's approval on all transportation contracts.  The answer is no.  
If you look at the ET&S policy on authority to grant transportation and 
storage discounts (I can fax it to you if you don' t have it), there is a 
column for ""Pre-approved Terms"" and one for ""Non Pre-Approved Terms"".  
Contracts that are not on a pre-approved form always have to have the Legal 
Dept's approval.  Contracts on pre-approved forms with a total discount (for 
the entire contract term) of less than $1.2 million do not need Legal's 
approval; those above the threshold do. Does that make sense?  As far as I 
know our marketers have been following this.  I spoke with TK and she is 
aware of the policy, and she is also aware that she needs to show me any 
contract that deviates from our standard language.  She has also discussed 
this with Steve Harris recently to make sure he's comfortable with the 
policy.

created by their previous signatures to the Interim settlement, I believe
the term section of the Interim settlement could reasonably be interpreted
to indicate that no other change of consequence, specifically:

  Provisions that the Commission agrees not to require
SoCalGas to implement prior to January 1, 2003 include, but are not limited
to, the following:  the establishment of a system of firm, tradable rights
in SoCalGas' intrastate transmission capacity and/or receipt point capacity
that would necessitate or create the likelihood of either rate design
changes or cost shifts between customer classes; the unbundling of the cost
of SoCalGas' intrastate transmission system; the institution of full-time
daily balancing for transportation service; any further unbundling of
storage costs; the implementation of shareholder risk for storage different
than the options provided in Section VII. of this Settlement;

I therefore would be hesitant to indicate that they do not oppose any
provision of the Interim settlement.  This is kind of sticky, but we have to
be careful how we word things...

with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely 
declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to 
conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me 
like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded 
interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at 
FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very 
leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their 
identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned 
that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney 
will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.  
Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from 
Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder

2558,"We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by ""no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel""??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the ""subject to transportation and 
fuel"" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

2567,"Dear fellow signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement: 

On Friday of last week, SoCalGas and PG&E informed ALJ Biren that Altra had 
definitively declined to offer the electronic trading services that both the 
already-approved PG&E settlement and the pending SoCalGas/SDG&E Comprehensive 
Settlement contemplated would be provided specifically by Altra for at least 
an intial period.? Both SoCalGas and PG&E sent a letter and email to to the 
full service list yesterday (Tues, 9/5) informing parties of this development.

SoCalGas believes that some modification to the Comprehensive Settlement in 
necessary to take this development into account, and that we then need to 
file the modification as soon as possible with the Commission.? The ALJ has 
indicated to us that some formal filing with the Commission in response to 
this development will be necessary.

We want to work with the signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement to reach 
a consensus as soon as possible.? Our goal is to cause little or no delay in 
the processing of a decision on the Comprehensive Settlement.

What SoCalGas has in mind is modifying the settlement to remove the specific 
naming of Altra and to insert language saying that SoCalGas will select and 
contract with a third-party provider for a specified period of time, without 
identifying in the settlement who that will be.?? We also need to consider 
whether we should address in the revision to the settlement how we will 
handle the possibility that the third-party provider will not be ready to 
operate by the April 1, 2001 date the settlement provides for the monthly 
imbalance trading, OFO day imbalance chip trading, and storage rights 
trading.? SoCalGas is looking at interim arrangements that it could provide 
in-house starting April 1, 2001, until the third-party provider could begin 
service.? We also might consider what would happen if no third party provider 
can be found.

To avoid any claims that we have not complied with the settlement rules, 
today we mailed and emailed to the full service list a notice of a settlement 
conference for Wednesday of next week.? We want to file something with the 
Commission very promptly thereafter.

2575,"I swore I would be one of those people who said never and really meant it.   
Well, I guess ""they"" are right . . .     
Clay and I have some news.  (No, I am not pregnant.)  But, we are buying a  
house in Dallas.  We close on it two days after my arrival in London.   
Thankfully, Clay will still be here.  We will rent it out over the next year  
while we are away.  Our move in date will be sometime next summer, depending  
on our tenants' situation.   
So, about the never say never part.  The house is in south Highland Park.   
Gasp!  We never expected to buy a house this soon.  And, I NEVER--I repeat  
NEVER-- expected that we would move to Highland Park upon graduating from law  
school, if EVER!  In fact, it was a condition of our marriage--I knew that we  
were going to end up in Dallas, but I made Clay promise that we would not  
have to settle in the Park Cities.  He promised, crossed his heart, hoped to  
die, and the whole bit.  All summer, we have been neighborhood shopping in  
Lakewood and East Dallas, an area that is close to downtown with wonderful  
homes and a sort of Austiny-feel.    
We spent some time checking out real estate cites on the web during our  
down-time at work, on a strictly just-for-fun basis.  We loved looking at  
older homes.  We dreamed about eventually getting something that was very  
livible for the time being but that would be really fun to update and  
restore.  Independently, we both came across a house in south east Highland  
Park (near the McKinney and Knox Henderson area) that was built in 1925 in  
the Craftsman style--our favorite.  We drove by it and checked it out on the  
internet for about three weeks.  Finally, we decided to call up a realtor and  
go see it.  We immediately fell in love--wood floors, beautiful original  
fixtures and ""rookwood"" fireplace, 9 foot ceilings, great backyard, etc.     
During the three week period, I had a huge and slightly dramatic internal  
debate about living in this area.  Would this mean I was destined to a life  
of suburban-driving, PTA morning, bubble head-ism???  Would we ever be able  
to escape our parents who live merely 5-7 minutes away?  Was I, deep-down,  
really a total snob?  If not, would I become one?  Would I have to go to the  
neighborhood Tom Thumb?  Would I become my mother?  
The bottom line was that we loved the house--the craftsman style lets us to  
combine Clay's desire for traditionalism and my love for modern design.  (In  
other words, it's a place where my red leather couch and his stuffed deer  
head might live comfortable together.)  Also, we really loved the location (6  
minutes from Downtown; right by our favorite restaurants and bar spots; and  
very close to the Katy Trail--Dallas' jogging biking trail).  So, I decided  
that we could make  Park Cities life work. . . I would just have to  
concentrates on the things that I always have said I WILL do, rather than the  
things I have said I would NEVER do.  I will invest in the lives of needy  
people; I will keep painting; I will remember that people, instead of things,  
make the world go 'round.   
After much prayer and consideration, Clay and I put down a REALLY low-ball  
offer on the house.  We negotiated for about a week, and the sellers finally  
accepted our offer.  We feel terribly blessed, and our prayer is that our  
home can be put to use for God's purposes.  (And, perhaps, a TX-OU party??)   
I am thankful for a husband who was fortunate enough to save every penny he  
ever earned and every little birthday check he ever received--and for a  
father-in-law who helped us get an excellent interest rate.   
So, that's the news . . . let the making fun of Jessica begin . . . I  
certainly deserve it.  Too bad I am leaving the country in a matter of  
days!!!    
Hope you guys are doing well.  I will have email in London, so shoot me one  
whenever possible!  You can reach me via Clay's cell phone until Friday  
(214)649-6914.  Sorry this message was so long.  Much love and big hugs to  
you all.

2576,"Per your request, here is my summary of the conversations that we have had to 
date about complying with the new marketing affiliate requirements in 
Standard L.  Frazier, Maria or Susan -- jump in if I missed something.  

New Standard L Requirements

Shared Employees.  Reporting on shared employees & facilities (161.3 
(l)(2)(i) and 161.3(l)(2)(ii)(c) is the easy part -- as we have no shared 
employees and I think we have only minor shared facilities which are 
disclosed in our standards of conduct.  Thus, we may want to tackle the 
shared facilities by posting our Standards of Conduct.

Relative Position of Entities in the Organization.  With respect to 161.3(l) 
(ii)(A).  Frazier has put together a idea about showing the relative position 
of the pipeline and the marketing affiliates in the corporate structure.  
Here's a sample of how the Northern reporting chain would look: 

Enron Corp.
 Enron Pipeline Holding Company
  Enron Operations Corp.
   Enron Pipeline Company
    Northern Natural Gas


Pipeline Org. Charts, Titles, Job Descriptions (and names of supervisory 
employees).  Section 161.3(l)(ii)(B) is probably the hardest part of the new 
requirements.  Frazier took the task of getting with HR to pull together 
initial org charts, titles and descriptions.  Since then I saw the new SAP 
employee system which lists job titles & descriptions.  Perhaps HR can get 
the information from there.  My ""to do"" is to get a couple samples of how the 
similar employee org. chart data is presented on the electric side in OASIS.


Bambi -- I'll make sure to include you in our next discussion.  Frazier - 
have you had a chance to talk with HR -- let us know when you are ready to 
get back together to discuss.",Maria Susan Frazier Bambi,,"Enron Corp. Enron Pipeline Holding Company Enron Operations Corp.

2578,"Hi, Sooz,  Was just wondering how you're feeling.  It's getting a little
boring here and especially difficult to lay around when I keep thinking of
all I have to accomplish.  Supposed to have that pastel workshop tomorrow and
half day Sun. but don't know if I'm up to it.  Good luck with the party!

2579,"Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under ""anti 
gouging"" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df    ",Stan Mike Moran Mike,100 50 up to $14/MMBtu 1,Cal CPUC FERC

Just returned from the Workman Gallery to pay for the painting--which, by the
way, I really like.  It's so nice to know you like something immediately and
don't have to sneak up on it for another look to make up your mind!  Anyway,
I was asking Wally about her gallery--she's been in business for 20 yrs, and
I'm sure in that time there were some really bad times for her here in
Austin.  I was telling her about you, and she said the woman who owns Sloan
Jordan Gal. in the arboretum is an attorney here in town, and is sure she
must have a business manager to run the place.  (Gail or Gayle something.)
Anyway, she said we should call her and invite her to lunch so you could talk
with her.

K, J & G are coming in Sat. for Karin's haircut.  Always anxious to see
Grayson.

Hope our tickets to ""Chorus Line"" are good.  I'm really looking forward to
it.  The performance starts at 2:30--a decent hour for you to get here.  We
can go out for drinks and dinner afterward.

surviving spouse.  Any community property issues between Greg and ex should 
have been settled in the divorce proceedings.  But it's been a while since I 
looked -- I will ask Bill for a second opinion.  

In any event, a will is a good idea, especially when kids are involved.  If, 
God forbid, the worst should happen, you can bet that ex + kids would make 
life even more difficult for you in what would already be a tough time!  Bill

2601,"On January 13, 2000, FERC issued a Section 7(c) certificate for 
Transwestern's Gallup Expansion.  The Commission's order contained two 
conditions:  1) that Transwestern file its discounted rates within 15 days of 
the order, and 2) that Transwestern restructure its relationship with Enron 
Compression Services so that Transwestern will have sufficient operation 
control over the motor at the Gallup compressor station to assume regulatory 
responsibility for the motor's operation, and that Transwestern file a report 
with the Commission stating how it complied with this condition.  
Transwestern accepted the  certificate January 14, 2000 but reserved the 
right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order.  On January 18, 2000, 
Transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the 
condition that Transwestern file its discounted rates.  Transwestern has 
already filed with the Commission the discounted rates it will charge its 
expansion shippers, subject to a request for confidentiality.   Transwestern 
intends to file a request for rehearing of the January 13 order explaining 
why the Commission erred in ordering Transwestern to publicly disclose its 
discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure

2609,"Main Entry: al?tru?ism
Pronunciation: 'al-tru-""i-z&m
Etymology: French altruisme, from autrui other people, from Old French, 
oblique case form of autre other, from Latin alter
Date: 1853
1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others

We got to talking about you at lunch today.  Rudy mentioned that in effort to 
get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him 
by consuming
so much of his time requesting reports.  My understanding is that your 
typical response to this is ""I am the most altruistic person.""  I am sure you 
recognize the hypocrisy 
laden in this statement.  If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not 
care if his acts are recognized or not.  In fact, the true altruist hopes 
only that his acts benefit
those to which they are directed.  We may have to downgrade you to ""concerned 
individual"".                       

But given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings I thought you would might 
like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr.

Goes to Washington Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 a.m.  If you haven't seen the 
film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic, 
extremely unselfish
young man who takes on the corrupt political machines of Washington, D.C.  
The film ranked 29th on AFI's (The American Film Institute) top 100 films of 
the Century list,
and is tied for first place on the Sscott5 Greatest Films List..

FYI- Neither you nor Nick have been removed from the group email, I simply 
haven't sent one out in the past two weeks.  I will make sure you both 
receive my next 
brilliant composition.  I must say I was tempted to remove you given your 
complaints about receiving all of the follow-up commentary and a lack of 
appearances.

2610,"Okay, so I'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend ( I haven't spent a weekend in Houston during April and can't imagine why I wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep).  Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion:

I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie.  On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Barton Springs piece).

The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday.

Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.  I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend.

I'm sorry I never got in touch with you last weekend, but I had the wrong 
phone number with me and didn't have enough brain power to think of using 
Information.  I don't think I would have been much fun anyway since I pretty 
much just ended up sleeping the whole weekend.  In fact, I fell asleep in the 
car on the ride back to my sister's house after the game and my parents 
decided to just leave me in the car.  I think I was probably out there for an 
hour before I woke up (needless to say I was very confused).  Anyway, hope 
things are going well for you and Clay.  I know everything must be kind of 
crazy for both of you right now with finals coming up and all of the 
interviewing you've both no doubt been doing. 

I really want to get a chance to see you and chat...I don't feel like we've 
had a good one in forever.  I will be in Austin over Thanksgiving for the 
game, so we could try to touch base then if you're going to be in town.  If 
not, I'm sure I can manage at least one weekend trip during December if 
there's a good weekend for you.  Just drop me  a line when you get a chance 
and let me know what's new with you.

RE:
Exchange Provided Order Tickets - FINAL REMINDER


Please be reminded that effective July 1, 2001, NYMEX will no longer provide 
order tickets to the COMEX Division.  All members and firms currently using 
Exchange provided order tickets will have to purchase their own tickets.  The 
Exchange will not guarantee inventory on form types (futures/options, 
3-part/4-part); it will only guarantee a supply of order tickets until July 
1, 2001.  As the current inventory is depleted it is permissible to 
interchange remaining forms in stock.  There are no restrictions concerning 
the recordation of option orders on futures order tickets or future orders 
being recorded on option order tickets; provided all relevant order 
information is recorded.

If members would like a list of the current NYMEX vendors that provide these 
order tickets, they can contact Ray Russo at (212) 299-2515.

Should you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact me at 
(212) 299-2072.

eliminate this concept, I just want to make certain that everyone is in 
agreement as to how this swap will terminate.  [Do we want partial 
terminations based upon partial asset sales?]

2.  Assuming that termination occurs upon sale of 100% of the assets, I need 
to be sure that the word ""sale"" is sufficient.  Should we use ""financial 
close"" or some other term of art?  I have concerns that a sale may be 
contingent or subject to some waiting period.

RE:  Exchange Provided Order Tickets


Effective February 1, 2001, NYMEX will no longer provide order tickets to the 
COMEX division.  These order tickets are no longer an integral part of trade 
processing and members will have to purchase their own order tickets.  After 
February 1st the Exchange will no longer guarantee that order tickets will be 
available, as we expect existing inventory to be depleted.

If members would like a list of the current NYMEX vendors that provide these 
order tickets, please contact Ray Russo at (212) 299-2515.

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING BASED UPON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTIES TO THIS 
PREPAY

(1)  The Toronto Dominion (Texas) master agreement with ECT is a restricted 
master.  It was negotiated for a prepay several years ago and is not 
necessarily market (or ENA) standard.  It should be reviewed immediately by 
legal and credit.

(2)  The Morgan Stanley Capital Group master agreement is very old.  IT IS 
NOT AN ISDA .  It is a 1992 Master Energy Price Swap Agreement (limited to 
simple transactions and commodities).  The terminology is not even ISDA 
terminology.  This master has been on the credit/legal radar screen for 
upgrading to an ISDA.

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas



The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading
Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange. ",J. Robert Collins Jr.,"half billion dollars $3

Further to my voicemail message of this afternoon, attached is the ""merger
letter"".  As it happens, both Chase and Morgan had ISDA agreements in
place.  The letter selects the Chase agreement (which, as you know, we
amended earlier this week), as the preferred agreement, and terminates the
Morgan agreement.

Please review and call me (212-270-2673) if you have any questions.  If the
letter is acceptable, please call me and I'll arrange for execution copies
to be sent to your attention.

Thankyou again for you help.

Indeed, we=01,ve been hard at work implementing changes for ShareBuilder.

We=01,ve just expanded our Research section, something many of you had=20

?  Interactive historical charts for stock performance.
?  Earnings estimates and financial data on public companies.
?  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings for each security.
?  Detailed company profiles.
?  Real-time market updates.

We have also installed a number of tools that you can use as easy-to-use=20
calculators that let you plan college savings, retirement, tax calculations=
=20
and so on.  These are provided as part of our Research area and will always=
=20
be available from our Home page.

Another important change regards the start of ""decimalization"" in the=20
securities industry - namely, quoting stock prices in decimal amounts inste=
ad=20
of in fractions.  This is something that affects everyone in the securities=
=20
industry and is intended to provide investors with simpler and more efficie=
nt=20
share pricing over time.  Decimal quotes officially began on August 28th at=
=20
the direction of the SEC for a small pilot group of stocks.  The pilot grou=
p=20
will expand significantly later this month.  Eventually, this system will b=
e=20
phased into the entire industry for all stocks. This is what it means for=
=20
you- if you are buying any of the stocks in the initial pilot group, then y=
ou=20
future purchases and quotes will be presented in decimal form; all other=20
stocks will continue to be quoted and traded in fractions.  The ShareBuilde=
r=20
stocks that are currently affected are listed below.

2725,"Re:  the speech.

(1) Both the Governor and Steve Reynolds thanked us for the speech and stated 
that it was exactly what they were looking for when they invited us to 
speak.  The Governor wanted the Commission to understand what was going on in 
energy markets outside of the Wyoming borders.

(2) I received a strong reaction from PacifiCorp's reaction to the notion 
that the electric utility industry was moving towards lower interaction costs 
(at the retail level).  Another representative for one of the coal concerns 
made the same comment.  These comments took us towards a discussion of what 
went wrong in California and retail restructuring of electricity.  

I partly agreed with PacifiCorp--i.e., I agreed that we were in a state of 
transition in the wholesale and retail markets.  I also pointed out that:  
(1) we couldn't look at California and reach any conclusion other than they 
messed up; (2) we didn't have an entirely free market in electricity in the 
West--i.e., it's a hybrid of regulation, etc.; and (3) that the model 
discussed in my presentation applied to more than just electricity (a point 
that the Gov. also made).  I said that it applies to wholesale electric 
markets in some areas, coal markets, gas markets, and that the model applies 
in wholesale markets even if the retail markets remain fully regulated.  

I pushed hard to take the discussion away from retail wheeling, restructuring 
etc., because the focus in Wyoming is and will be the commodity and how to 
maximize the value of that commodity for Wyoming.  The Governor on a number 
of occasions tried to steer the discussion in this direction (i.e., away from 
retail).  

(3) Nancy Vanderberg (El Paso--a former Enron employee) sends her regards.  
She asked a question about the impact of the virtual integration on Wyoming.  
I told her that it was affecting Wyoming producers and consumers.  

(4) The CEO from Lower Valley Electric asked how Wyoming can benefit from 
competition in commodity and noted how WalMart uses predatory pricing to kill 
off smaller local competitors.  I responded with the usual--make sure no 
barriers to entry, when the price gets high enough competitors will take on 
WalMart, etc.

(5) Another member of the Commission asked what could be done immediately.  
In response I plugged RTO West and urging FERC to move up the timeline on 
RTOs, ensuring that all customers are treated the same, etc.  The Gov. gave a 
number of strong nods to the suggestion that we expedite RTO West, etc.

(6) The Gov. mentioned wind resources several times in the littany of energy 
resources available to producers in Wyoming.   He also pointed out 
deficiencies in Wyoming-East connections on both gas and electric as well as 
deficiencies in Wyoming-Calfornia pipeline constraints.  


A few more notes on the meeting yesterday in Cheyenne (FYI)

(7) The Governor and the lead staff person on the Energy Commission (Steve 
Reynolds) are both very interested in pursuing discussions with Enron.  I 
affirmed your interest in meeting with the Governor and indicated we would be 
contacting them to arrange a date that was convenient.

(8)  These guys are serious and dedicated.  The Commission was given a $1 
million budget and authority to take legislative and regulatory positions on 
behalf of the state.  During the meeting the Commission approved a series of 
additional meetings, working groups and advisory committees.  Sue Landwehr 
and I will check back with Steve over the next few days to get a list of the 
meetings, working groups, etc.

(9) My conversations with Steve Reynolds clearly indicates that the Governor 
and the Governor's staff are familiar with how commodity markets 
work--particularly ag products.  They understand the concept of basis and 
also understand that energy commodity markets work best when there is 
adequate transmission capacity, gas pipeline capacity and rail capacity.  
They also understand that their are some contraints on the transmission 
system (a complete constraint moving east, off-peak constraints moving north, 
south, and west), limited take away capacity on the one major pipeline 
serving the state (Kern--perhaps due to downstream constraints), and some 
problems with the cost of rail transportation (if not a constraint).  While 
they have a working understanding of all these things, they haven't been able 
to put it all together in a cohesive way.  

(10) Wyoming wants to produce more energy for the west (and the rest of the 
country), but wants to avoid the boom and bust cycle of a resource dependent 
state.  (For example, the state moved from a $250 million deficit in FY 1999 
to an approximately $750 million surplus in FY 2000).  They also want to 
diversify the state's economy and bring economic development.  For example, a 
major focus of the state's Business Council has been to recruit ""server 
farms""--because of their load and high load factors.  They talked about 
co-locating server farms and generation along the southern tier of the state 
(which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth available). 

(11) The Wyoming PSC held a meeting yesterday afternoon on hedging.  In his 
comments to the Commission, PSC Chairman Steven Ellenbecher said that the 
state should clarify the utility's responsibility to either:  (1) build their 
own power plants; or (2) acquire a portfolio of resources and hedge.  Steve 
talked alot about the volatility in gas markets and electric markets and how 
the utilities that owned their own generation faired the best in 
2000/2001--because the generation acted as a hedge against market prices.  
Steve was also supportive of gas restructuring at the retail level--but 
silent on electric restructuring.","Steve Reynolds Nancy Vanderberg Steve

2729,"?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--""contributed to Edison's undercollection"" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the ""undercollection"" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

2743," It is critical to our nation's energy future  to achieve robust competition 
in wholesale power markets in order to ensure that electricity can move most  
effectively from where it is produced to where it is most needed. To that 
end, this Administration will strongly encourage the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission( FERC)  to actively exercise jurisdiction over all 
aspects of electricity transmission in interstate commerce and place all uses 
of the grid under the same rates, terms, and conditions.  This jurisdiction 
must also be extended by Congress to cover non-FERC jurisdictional power 
authorities.

2744,"I bring this Minnesota bill to your attention thinking that it may be one  
state that we can point to as moving forward rather than backward as a 
response to California.  This bill would absolutely not have moved if 
California had not been on the radar screen--for the first time in four 
years, the leadership insisted that the caucuses move something out of 
committee on energy.

WHile customer choice did not ultimately survive (it got knocked out towards 
the end of the committee votes), there was a general agreement by committee 
members that MN had to prepare for retail access, but that they needed to get 
the wholesale market in better shape in preparation.

By the way, the enviromental community was very very confident that they were 
going to get a mandate for a 10% renewable portfolio standard by 2015, and 
they were then going to make Minnesota the poster child to promote mandated 
RPS across the country.  Their mandate turned into ""goals"" to be met by 
utilities, and they are not happy.

2746,"This is a follow up to my September 19 e-mail.  The attached revised trial schedule was issued after the hearing held on Tuesday.  It reflects a recognition by the ISO of errors or omissions in its data relating to neutrality adjustments, resolved settlement disputes, penalties and OOM purchases.  It postpones the end of the proceeding until March 8, to provide time for correction of these deficiencies prior to undertaking the rest of the schedule.  Hearings on the various issues will be bifurcated- the hearing on Issue 1 (mitigated market clearing price) will be held 12/17-21, while the hearing on Issues 2 and 3 (amounts of refunds and offsets thereto) will be held on 2/11-15.  This outcome is good because Issues 2 and 3 were not split up, and additional hearing days were incorporated into the schedule.  The immediately upcoming events include an ISO sworn statement on Issue 1, due 10/9, and participants' simultaneous responsive testimony on Issue 1, due 11/6.

I would expect that the ISO will take approximately 3 weeks to re-run its numbers to correct their neutrality adjustment errors, and this will result in a new (and likely increased) claim against us.  Initially, ISO had claimed approximately $38MM from us, and their last erroneous iteration indicated that they owed us $1MM.

I have asked Gloria Ogenyi to lead this effort for us.  We will need other groups to appoint a Lead for their teams as soon as possible (I will work with Evan, Legal, and Product Development to find out the appropriate people).

I fully concur with Rogers that within all new Product Development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity.   As important, just because we don't want to attract new business in a given market doesn't mean that our responsibilities have ended.  We need to ensure that our Product Development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term.  To ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations, I would recommend that Gloria be on the Product Development sign-off sheet.

In addition, we have already begun reviewing obligations, etc. for our current market activity (both wholesale and retail).  I will talk with Gloria to build the matrix of issues you referenced.  Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations.

The objective of this program is not to teach you how to do a deal, but rather, to give you a better understanding of how basic financial principals contribute to the structure of a deal.    It will also provide you with insight to Enron deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work that goes into putting one together.

When you leave the program, you will have:

R	An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to Enron's transactions.
R	A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the ""deal space"" and how the financial principals discussed 	relate to 	Enron deals.
R	The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an Enron deal.

2757,"Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:

2758,"Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Fines:

     I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

EOL:

We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

We believe Dynegy created a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs.",Phillip Dynegy,two cents,VAR

As you may remember, we last met at the Directors' conference in Barcelona,
last October.

On that occasion, I asked you whether you would be agreeable to the idea of
meeting some of the top executives of a client that I am serving in France,
EDF and even giving them a speech at their marketing conference. Given the
short notice, this turned out to be impossible at that point in time since,
at that time, you were ""booked"" for the following three months, if I
remember well!

You also told me that, provided you received some ""advanced notice"", it
would not be too difficult to organise the encounter at a different date
that the one I had then mentioned.

I am thus sending you this message to find out what is the earliest date we
could meet with you, preferably in Texas, since our client executives would
like to take advantage of the encounter to meet not only you, but also some
members of your management team.

Once I have a reply from you, I shall inform our client of the dates you
suggest and get back to you to finalise detail of when we could travel to
Texas and who we would like to meet, ideally .

I hope all is well with you and I look forward to reading your response to
this message.

Following on from our brief discussion during your last visit to London, I 
just wanted to give you a heads-up on where we are with the Du Pont/ETOL 
steam/power deal given the discussions you and Harold had with them earlier 
in the year.  Based on prior experience in getting to closure with Du Pont, 
there is a chance that someone senior from Du Pont will put in a call to you 
or maybe Lou/Tom to express disappointment on progress and encourage Enron 
concessions, resulting in premature deal closure for us.

ETOL has tabled a blend-and-extend deal to Du Pont, in which they have shown 
interest to get to closure.  However, they just want to transact on the major 
value items for themselves now and then deal with other Enron value items 
next year in good faith.  We have indicated that we will commit Enron 
resource to get the whole deal done as soon as possible, specifying a Jan 01 
start, and will not allow cherry picking.

Whilst the overall impact to ETOL is PV neutral, the deal does substantially 
reduce long term volume risk on what is already a deep in the money deal for 
us.  The motivation for DuPont is that the deal results in immediate annual 
savings, around $3m in 2001, which fits with their corporate goal to deliver 
energy savings.

If you are called by Du Pont and need more info let me know.  We want the 
whole package from them.

Our main concern (and the reason we would like a 10- business day time

the staffing and bank pre-arrangements to be able to put an LOC in place
within a shorter period. Since we don't currently exchange collateral,
posting a LOC would not be something we do in the normal course of business.

Leonard, who was the lone Republican to vote for the bill yesterday, is
meeting with Republicans now to try and get their support.  It is widely
held that his rationale for voting for the bill was because he was concerned
that if the bill did not get out in its current form, liberal Democrats
would have amended the bill to look more like the original bill. This is
likely the reason why they need Republicans now.  Assembly session begins at

[1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash 
After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority 
is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature 
looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its 
monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing 
its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism 
from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority 
escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and 
fuel cells at [18]. 
[18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority 
(from [1]) 
Is the California Power Authority a dangerously 
out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting 
back some state control over electricity supplies? 
The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the 
Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter 
and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. 
The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember 
Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair 
of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob 
Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal 
authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, 
SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the 
Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping 
the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly 
the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, 
Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy 
Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps 
between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. 
Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer 
Power and Conservation Financing Authority. 
Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and 
heads of other agencies the Power Authority must 
work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose 
Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector 
of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed 
Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal 
to have it buy peaker output. California Energy 
Commission members said they are at policy odds 
with the Power Authority's siting plans. 
In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said 
that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil 
peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not 
able to respond quickly enough to balancing power 
needs. ""The letters of intent already approved by the 
Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb 
that power given the outlook for net-short need."" 
Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority 
power will be via contract, not the spot market. ""Selling 
on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky,"" said 
Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. 
The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently 
in the position of actually being able to acquire 
new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to 
underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in 
limbo and the California Independent System Operator 
is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority 
cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic 
house in order, and an Assembly investigation might 
jeopardize that [J.A. Savage].

2812,"Governor wants to cut costs of power 
Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- With an economic ""perfect storm"" and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. 
But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. 
""If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?"" asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. 
And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. 
""Good luck!"" former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. 
Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. 
The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. 
""This could save billions of dollars,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis' power contract renegotiation plan. 
Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is ""not targeting every contract"" because the pacts have been ""extremely valuable in keeping the market stable."" 
The governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. 
The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. 
The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. 
Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. 
The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. 
The liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing ""perfect storm"" of fiscal calamities. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. 
The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. 
Burton has called ""for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts."" 
The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. 
Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. 
The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. 
Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. 
But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. 
The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. 
""We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'"" said Calpine's Cartwright. 
If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be ""very, very severe,"" but also ""they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them,"" Cartwright said. 
His comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. 
Heller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis ""is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts."" 
""Last spring,"" Heller said, ""power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals.""",Davis Steve Geissinger Gray Davis Peter Cartwright Pete Wilson Doug Heller Barry Goode Phil Angelides John Burton Burton Wilson Calpine Cartwright Heller,multibillion-dollar billions of dollars more than $40 billion 69 multimillion-dollar $12.5 billion the billions of dollars up to $14 billion $20 billion-plus about $100 billion,Calpine Corp. the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights GOP Stanford University Public Utilities Commission Senate PUC The Western Power Trading Forum Calpine

A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs group commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to California.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? ""What we do in life echoes through eternity"".  I think of these words often and believe them more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and internal to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere.  

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal appreciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportunity to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where these changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to earn your trust and respect.  

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advance of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For those not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take some additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work and business demands permitting.

Thank you.

2818,"
This note is to report on two electricity legislative developments: the Aug. 2nd introduction of an anti-RTO bill (or at least anti-mandatory RTOs) and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black, the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this Fall.

1.  H.R. 2814 (Reps. Tom Sawyer (D-OH) and Richard Burr (R-NC))

On Aug. 2nd (the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess), the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced H.R. 2814, the Interstate Transmission Act.  The legislation is bad because, among other things, it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs, with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs.  Also objectionable is that the bill would ""limit"" pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a ""reasonable transition mechanism or period"" for additive charges.  The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO.  The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form, structure and operating entity of any RTO.

In addition to the RTO language, the bill has the ""old"" version of the NERC reliability legislation in it.  The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs, repeals Federal Power Act sec. 203 on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company.

Barbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep. Sawyer's district.  Rep. Burr is from North Carolina, so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him.  I am checking into where Duke is on this issue.  Rep. Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin -- so his support for this legislation is significant (see Andy Black comment below).

2.  Andy Black Meeting

Andy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation.  He is only meeting with a few companies on a one-on-one basis -- Enron, Reliant, Dynegy and TXU.  His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day.  If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes, the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment.  The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill, the issue will be ripe for consideration in a House-Senate conference committee.  Here is a run down of my comments and Andy's comments on specific issues.

a.   RTOs

Chairman Barton supports RTOs.  At a minimum, the draft will affirm FERC's authority as the commissioners have requested.  Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation.  Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee.  He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs.  Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps.  However, Andy asked me to look at sec. 3 of the Sawyer-Burr referenced above, which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs.  I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the Sawyer-Burr bill is based on voluntary RTOs.  Hopefully, he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects.  I will strongly encourage him to ""do the right thing"" in that regard.

b.   PUHCA

The draft will use the Pickering bill (H.R. 1101).  Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill.  Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enron's records -- even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliate.

c.  PURPA

Prospective repeal.  On back up power, they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state.

d.   Interconnection

They have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like.  I am contacting EPSA to get the details.

e.   Net Metering

They are likely to include the Inslee bill to require ""net metering.""  I explained our concern that the bill's mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers -- including EES -- even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve; that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES (per Jim's helpful comments yesterday).  I need to get more information to Andy.

f.   Transmission Jurisdiction

Thankfully, Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction.  Specifically, the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale -- the draft will not get into the bundled/unbundled issue at all.  The draft will bring munis, co-ops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes.

g.   Siting

On siting, Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches.

h.   Reliability

On a negative note, Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERC's version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support (i.e., not PJM).  I explained our concerns.  He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version.  He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate.

i.   Negawatts

I raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list.  He said he is open to considering it again, but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the ""California bill"" earlier this summer.

?			Comments due November 19th

?
As discussed on the last Gas Issues Working Group conference call, attached are draft EPSA comments on FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on pipeline capacity recall.  EPSA opposes the NOPR because it (a) will reduce competition in the secondary market for transportation services and (b) may reduce the pipeline operational flexibility needed by electric generators.   Thus, EPSA urges the Commission not to impose a broad based recall requirement throughout the natural gas industry but rather gain experience with this difficult issue in individual Order No. 637 proceedings.

2820,"On today's call:

It is clear this paper's value is as much to get EPSA member's educated as it is to educate FERC staff.  Julie S. was adamant the FERC staff need some input. I trust her judgement so I too support  getting a ""leave behind"" to them even if EPSA's position is still evolving.

I think we can support Craig Roach's advice, which is in the draft, to go for the Economic Capacity test, which is a simplified Delivered Price Test.   As with any test, the devil is in the  details but everyone on the call seems this test can be kept simple. Craig agreed to send me an example of such a test. 

Most of Jim's issues got raised in the call and will be incorporated in the draft.

The tension/dilemma of trading off 1x, supplier-specific MBR certificate for a blanket MBR certificate to any participant in a properly structured RTO came up several times.  Everyone recognizes that we'll need a replacement for hub-N-spoke before RTO's will obviate the need for certificates altogether.  That being said, I still think we should support such a trade because it keeps a beneif of  RTOs (everone gets MBR) highly visible.

The highlight of the call was Huntoon's/Dynegy's request to raise the stranded costs created by changing the standard for MBR.  Julie said it would not pass the laugh test but he would not back down.  I tend to agree with Julie:  if you built an asset on getting market based rates and because of a change in standards you are forced to cost-of-service, I am hard pressed to agree you have a valid stranded cost claim (i.e., you will still get return of and return on your plant).  I think it is better to focus on the going-forward impact of bad tests (e.g., loss of investors, loss of market participants, etc.)

Finally, all of Chriti's comments were essentially addressed between the 1st and 2nd drafts. 

Because the call got unwieldy, Julie allowed another round of comments, due mid-day Tues, with the hope of getting it out the door next week.

Please review my attached comments by COB Monday.  I would like to forward them onto EPSA late Monday.

Janet -

1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.

Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.

I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA (for customers already on DA).  Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter.

My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this (maybe?) and our #1 priority is to work to get the PG&E model adopted across the state.  Any news on how SCE and SDG&E will move forward?

2863," As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

2864,"Hello Joseph (""Me""),

I went to the party...it was nice, as they always are, lots of very low cut 
dresses and people politicking ...not my first choice of how I like to spend 
my Saturday nights !!   Are you going to the ENA party ?  I am not surprised 
you slept most of the weekend ...you were exhausted on Friday...I could 
barely get a smile out of you :<)
I was prepared to play ""crisis hotline"" this weekend....I thought at some 
point you might start feeling out of sorts and need to talk.  I'm curious how 
much of last Wednesday nights conversation you remember....hummmmm  !?!?
I'm heading to Vegas Wednesday ...returning Friday evening ...decided  it 
wasn't a good idea for Jay to meet me out there...severing the ties is 
tough...don't you agree ?!?!
Melba, who is in production, is out today...with hope, she will return 
tomorrow and we can set something up tomorrow afternnoon  ...that's what I'm 
shooting for, if she doesn't return, I'll leave a message for her to set 
something up with you.

Have a nice afternoon ...glad you caught up on your sleep !





",Joseph Jay afternnoon  ,,the ENA party
2865,"There will be a little soiree at my place around 7:00 this Saturday night 
before the Enron Christmas party.  Anyone is welcome to show up, so if I 
missed anyone, sorry.  Cocktails & hors d'oeuvres will be served.  Just bring 
yourself and your date (if you have one).  I'll have beer, wine and some 
other various alcoholic beverages.  Live entertainment will be provided by 
Big Daddy Kayne.
I live on the corner of Fannin & Capitol at the St. Germain.  Go in the walk

 Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game agai=
nst the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear. =
 Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Oper Error Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for o=
nly 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the b=
all 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a=
 starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some w! or! =
k at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 11/18/01 We=
stbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defen=
ses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often=
 after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Update=
d 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once b=
y Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have=
 a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - BCWD's Updated 11/1=
8/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 ca=
rries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very t=
hin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caugh=
t two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate=
 for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie=
 Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed=
 for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a s=
core. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the=
 goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of =
the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caugh=
t 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yard=
s and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numb=
ers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.=
  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passe=
s for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone agai=
n. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin a=
t wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Kar Bombs Updated 11/18/01 Terrell cau=
ght one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consisten=
t enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  M! arty Booker , WR CHI - BCWD's=
 Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at=
 Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout=
. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces=
.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limi=
ted Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still n=
ot proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD=
 - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against O=
akland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been =
down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact=
 that he held out for the entire preseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against=
 Jacksonville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid r=
eceiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable total=
s.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Starboy Updated 11/18/01Flutie's recent struggles=
 continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he=
 faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   =
Stacey Mack , RB JAC - God Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing ya=
rds on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the=
 Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Upda=
ted 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 =
yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in=
 the league and is a must-start every week.   Jerry Rice , WR OAK - El-Gato=
 Updated 11/18/01 Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for=
 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every=
-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fa=
ntasy numbers when the matchup is right.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/18/01 Banks was carted ! of! f the field in the second quarter =
of Sunday's game at Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graha=
m.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 11/18/01 Favre threw for 262 ya=
rds and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was intercepted three times and=
 lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play in recent weeks, Favre's pot=
ential for big games makes him a must-start every week.  Corey Bradford , W=
R GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Bradford caught three passes for 117 yar=
ds against Atlanta. The Green Bay wideout is still too inconsistent to be c=
onsidered a solid Fantasy player.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Update=
d 11/18/01 Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs =
and two interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.  Bob =
Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Christian rushed for 40 ya=
rds and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green Bay. The Falcons are using=
 him more often, and Christian makes a good backup RB rig! ht! now.  Elvis =
Grbac , QB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 11/18/01 Grbac threw for 261 yards, two=
 TDs and was intercepted four times by the Browns. The veteran QB has been =
a big disappointment this year and should not start for most Fantasy teams.=
  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Brookins rushed for 89 y=
ards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie is a servicable, yet unsp=
ectacular Fantasy player who should give you some occasional TDs down the s=
tretch.   Tim Couch , QB CLE - Hurricanes Updated 11/18/01 Couch threw for =
only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at Baltimore. The Cleveland =
QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup right now.  Benjamin Gay ,=
 RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Gay saw his first extensive action of=
 the year, carrying the ball 18 times for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. H=
e displayed good vision and lateral quickness, and Gay is definitely worth =
picking up if you need help at RB.   James Jackson , RB CLE - God Updated 1=
1/18/01 Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel W=
hite shared carries in his place.   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - God Updated 11/1=
8/01 Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith a=
ppears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless =
you lack depth at RB.  Chris Chambers , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/18/0=

2883,"		ISO Market Participants:
		On April 26, 2001, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) issued its ""Order  Establishing Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring
Plan for the California Wholesale Electric Markets and Establishing an
Investigation of Public Utility Rates in Wholesale Western Energy Markets.""
One of the fundamental principles of this Order is to:
			""Require sellers with PGAs as well as non-public
utility generators located in California, that make sales through the ISO's
markets or that use the ISO's interstate transmission grid (with the
exception of hydroelectric power), to offer all their available power in
real time during all hours.""
		The Order also requires generators covered by the Order to
report certain generator performance data  to the ISO.
		On April 27th and 30th and on May 7th, the ISO issued Market
Notices on the Order's requirement for submission of generator performance
data.  Since that time, the ISO has received several questions regarding the
applicability of the Order to Qualifying Facilities (QFs).  By this
Supplemental Market Notice, the ISO clarifies  the Order's applicability to
QFs as follows:
		Applicability
		The Order sets forth a ""must-offer"" obligation on certain
generators, requiring these generators to  offer to the ISO, in real-time,
all available capacity not under contract.  At Section II.B. ""Selling
Obligations,"" the Order provides that the  following categories of
generators are subject to the must-offer requirements:
*	Those generators with Participating Generator Agreements (PGAs);
*	All sellers into ISO markets, including non-public utility sellers,
that own or control generators located in California;
*	To the extent all sellers of energy that own or control generators
in California (including non-public utilities) are not selling ""into ISO
markets"", the Order includes all sellers that own or control generators in
California (including non-public utilities) whose power uses the
ISO-controlled interstate transmission facilities.
		The Order applies to all QFs in California. All QFs in
California use the interstate transmission facilities operated by the ISO,
whether supplying power under power purchase agreements (PPA) with the UDCs
or engaging in bilateral transactions.  Whether or not a QF must comply with
the reporting requirements outlined below depends on the specific
circumstances applicable to the facility.
		If a QF supplies all of its power pursuant to its power
purchase agreement (PPA) with the UDC, the QF does not have available
capacity subject to the ""must-offer"" condition and it does not have to
comply with reporting requirements outlined below.  In these circumstances,
the power generated under the contract is already scheduled with the ISO and
is serving load in California.
		If a QF has either: (1) a PPA with the UDC that has expired
(or who has received a regulatory or court order allowing the QF to sell the
contracted-for capacity to third parties) or (2) capacity in excess of the
amounts under contract to the UDCs, then the QF is subject to the
""must-offer"" condition and it must comply with reporting requirements
outlined below.
		Reporting Requirements
		In addition to establishing a ""must-offer"" obligation, the
Order requires generators to provide certain operating data to the ISO to
enable it to verify the amount of available capacity from each generating
unit as defined above.  Each above-defined generating unit must submit to
the ISO data on:
1.	Pmax;
2.	Pmin;
3.	Unit ramp rate;
4.	Heat rates (for units using natural gas as their primary fuel);and
5.	Emission rates (for units using natural gas as their primary fuel).

2885,"Effective Trade Date March 1, 2001, the ISO will implement a new Charge
Type, CT3999, to account for the Interest and Penalty Charges on unpaid
balances.  Since December 2000,the ISO has been allocating interest and
penalties to CT 1010.  All future charges, beginning with Trade Date March
1, 2001, will be reflected in Charge Type 3999.  Interest and Penalty
Charges will be made through manual adjustment (Type A) records and will be
based on the current interest rate plus 2% penalty (compounded annually,
calculated daily).  This is a monthly charge and will be posted to the last
trade date of the month.

Effective on the Preliminary Statement for trade date 3/1/01:

This notice is intended to inform participants as early as possible of the
new charge type.

2886,"The following are a few more details related to the April 26 FERC order:

1. Implementation date is May 29 per the FERC order, not June 1 as I
indicated in the MIF meeting.

2. Gas prices will be available in the new OASIS site starting 8:00 am on
May 28.  See http://oasisp.caiso.com.
If for some reason, OASIS is not able to publish the prices, we will be
sending out the prices via e-mail to all market participants and/or system
messages display in the SI workspace.

3. Replacing the bids for gas-fired generators with proxy bids during
mitigation hours:
*	We will determine mitigation hours by checking system status between
45 and 10 minutes before the start of an operating hour.  The decision will
apply for a whole hour.  We will not operate hours partially under
mitigation and partially under non-mitigation.  A report indicating which
hours are mitigation hours will be published on the new OASIS site.  The
latest status will be posted at the top of each operating hour.
*	For generators in the control area only, that we have visibility to
(individually scheduled unit, gross metering), we will be checking for
available capacity, and we will be extending or inserting Supplemental
Energy bids on behalf of the SC to include the extra capacity.  The bids for
the additional energy will be priced on the proxy curve.

4. Extending or inserting bids for must-offer generators by the ISO:
*	For generators in the control area only, that we have visibility to
(individually scheduled unit, gross metering), we will be checking for
available capacity, and we will be extending or inserting Supplemental
Energy bids on behalf of the SC to include the extra capacity.  The bids for
the additional energy will be priced at $0.
*	Units awarded regulation will not be subject to ISO capacity
checking, and therefore not subject to bid extending or inserting.
*	If a unit has not submitted a supplemental energy bid, we will only
generate a new Supp Energy bid for that unit if it appears to be available
and dispatchable during real-time.   In order to facilitate that we are
using the following criteria: the unit is a combustion turbine, the unit has
a non-zero hour ahead schedule, or the unit has been awarded ancillary
services.

5. Submittal of single Heat Rate and Emission Rate points, or no points:
*	For those units that have only submitted data for one operating
point, and are capable of generating over multiple operating ranges, or in
general cases where we believe the data to be inadequate, we will substitute
the operating point(s) with the data from current or pre-existing RMR
contracts where possible.  If RMR data does not exist for a unit, we reserve
the right to use other data from other sources to replace the submitted
data.
*	For those units that have not submitted any data, we will assume the
unit is a price taker and generate proxy bids at $0.

6. For those of you trying to cover your GMMs:

	A SC asked about what happens when they have to overgenerate above
their Hour Ahead schedule to cover their GMM, and then we dispatch them the
difference between Pmax and their HA schedule to comply with the FERC order.


	Example:
	SC has a 31MW unit.  Their GMM is 0.967, or about 1 MW of losses.
They usually submit an HA schedule of 30 MW, and generate at 31 MW to cover
the GMM.

	The answer is that A unit that keeps the ISO apprised of its
availability in real-time and performs in accordance with its bid
characteristics when dispatched should not receive penalties.
	A unit with a Final HA Schedule of 30 MW that is dispatched for the
additional 1 MW and generates 31 MW according to meter data will not be
penalized under CT 485.  The Total Obligation for CT 485 for a unit that is
dispatched for Incremental Energy is Final HA Schedule + 90% of Instructed
Incremental Energy.  The Total Obligation for the hour is compared to the
hourly meter value for that unit and is not adjusted for transmission
losses, i.e.. GMM is not taken into account. (Currently, penalties for
failure to perform are assessed on an hourly basis, however CT 485 may be
assessed on an interval basis in the future.)  So the Total Obligation for
the unit is 30 MW + .9 MW ( 90% of 1 MW) = 30.9 MW which is less than the
meter of 31 MW.  For CT 485 purposes, this unit will not receive any
penalties.
	It is important to note that there is a 10% tolerance or 2 MW for
Instructed Energy less than 20 MW on CT 485 penalties.  If the unit is
instructed for less than 20 MW, 2 MW will be taken off of the Instructed
Incremental Energy instead of 10%.  This means that any unit that has an
Incremental Instruction for 2 MW or less would not be flagged for CT 485
review.
	For other Settlement charge types such as, CT 401 and No Pay charges
on Spin, Non-Spin, and Replacement, a unit is required to provide the
Instructed Energy plus any transmission losses in order to receive full
credit for providing  the Scheduled Energy and Ancillary Services.

If it turns out that I need to be here earlier than 11:30, please call me on the cell phone and I'll be head this way.

Thanks and I'll see you tomorrow,

2911,"Dear Bill,

  If I remember correctly, you will be having a real-time trader meeting tomorrow.  
We were wondering if you thought it might be beneficial for Mike, Donna, and I to formally introduce ourselves (especially to the 4 new guys) at the end of your meeting and to address a few items of importance and how they affect EPMI getting paid (California, El Paso, MPC, tranny charges, and traders' logs).  Please let us know if you think our input might be useful.

Thanks,

Virginia",Bill Mike Donna,,EPMI MPC

      Notes:  Data for 1995 through 1999 are final.  All other
  data are preliminary unless otherwise noted.  Estimates for the
  most recent two months are derived from the Short-Term
  Integrated Forecasting System (STIFS). See Natural Gas Monthly,
  Appendix A Explanatory Note 7 for a discussion of revision
  policy.  Gas in storage at the end of a reporting period may
  not equal the quantity derived by adding or subtracting net
  injections or withdrawals during the period to the quantity of
  gas in storage at the beginning of the period.  Totals may not
  equal sum of components because of independent rounding. 
  Geographic coverage is the 50 States and the District of
  Columbia.

2945,"Greetings from Amsterdam.....

A few things that I have to follow up on from previous updates:

The APB (All Points Bulletin) on Kevin Watler's bike was cancelled last
month....and the reward went unclaimed.  He found the bike himself.
Amnesia?  Senility?  We'll know soon enough.  But on the other hand, I have
had three bikes stolen in an eight week span.  So right now I have no bike,
and it's pissing me off.  I thought I lived in a nice neighborhood,
obviously I was sadly mistaken, Bike thieves are running rampant on the
Keizersgracht!  Visitors Beware......

There has been a fair amount of drinking going on in Amsterdam this
summer.....here are some highlights....

Doug, Kevin Watler and Tinhead left a club in Sweden got in a cab and ended
up in Copenhagen, Denmark.  I'm pretty sure the cab driver ripped us off,
but I was involved, so that shouldn't surprise anyone.  One plus...we saw a
beautiful sunrise.

Simon left the Supper Club a few weeks ago and was later found by Watler
laying on his back on a canal bridge and singing to himself....I wasn't
there, but the rumor is he was singing, ""It's Raining Men"".  But you didn't
hear that from me....

Three weeks ago most of the German Electricity Desk took out clients to the
Okura Hotel for sushi.  We all brought dates, my date was not impressed,
I'll tell you why.....for starters, we all got bombed on hot Sake.  After
dinner we were started on cocktails.  We all decided to go to the Supper
Club for some more drinks.  I got up to go to the bathroom before we left.
Unfortunately....I walked into a wall instead.  So surprisingly enough I got
into the cab that was going to Keizersgracht 393, not the cab that was going
to the Supper Club with Simon.  In hind sight I think I made the right
call.....(see story above about Simon, same night!!!)

Eric Pierce has been having trouble riding his bike drunk this summer.  He
recently has ridden into the tram tracks and flipped over his handle bars.
A stunt that should not be attempted stone cold sober, let alone under the
influence of alcohol.....on a another occasion, he drove his bike into a
wall.   Kathryn and I are discussing the possibility of putting training
wheels on his bicycle....I'll let you know what we decide.

Speaking of bike riding....Kevin and Missy were riding back from a bar and
it started pouring down rain, I mean pouring!  So they stopped by my
apartment to get out of the rain, I was in Corsica but Eric and Katherine
were there.  Apparently the four of them found the my robe and the guest
robes and had a ""Robe Party"".  I'm hoping to hear the real story before I
die......I'm not holding my breath.  

Shockingly enough that was not the last party to be had at my apartment in
my absence....

Missy and I cooked a dinner party for twelve people two weeks ago at my
place.  I'm pretty sure everyone would agree that it was a huge success.
Only one little slip up....Missy and I forgot to serve our guests the green
tea ice cream we made from scratch that afternoon.  But don't worry, we
didn't forget to ""meet"" in the kitchen between courses and eat the ice cream
ourselves......oh yeah, we planned that the whole time.  Anyway, I passed
out at about midnight, from what I was told the party, ended at about 3:30
in the morning.

A very similar thing happened last Saturday night, but then again all of
last week was a little out of control.  I'll leave last weeks stories
(antics) for the next update, trust me, they are worth the wait....

I have an update from the human resources department....

Eric Pierce and Kathryn Adamson (engaged to be married) moved over here from
New Zealand.  He is working on the French Desk and running the Continental
Options Desk.   If anyone remembers, they are the couple I visited for New
Year's Eve in New Zealand in 1997-1998.  Anyway, they are part of the
Amsterdam Prebon Team now....

Also, I can't believe it, but I have MORE baby announcements.....Welcome to
the world, Peter Travers, Madeline (my cousin Tammy's daughter), Alex
Chandler, and the Halstead Twins (girls, I haven't heard their names
yet)......I am very behind in the gifts department, I'm thinking I'll start
sending the gifts as soon as the kids can thank me themselves.

Also, I just planned this today.......I am coming to New York for the
Weekend of August 17th and 18th.  I have a croquet tournament on Saturday
and Saturday night.  But since I never get to see everyone when I come
home....I'm throwing a party Friday night.  I'm starting it early, so
everyone with weekend plans can at least stop by, say hello, and split if
they want to.  I'm throwing it at McFadden's (Elvis, email me right away
please) and if I'm lucky we might just have the Nancy Luca Band there....!
For all that can make it, I'll be at McFadden's (42nd Street and 2nd Avenue)
from about 4:30pm on....so please stop by, you won't regret it.

That's about it from Europe, I hope to see a lot of you one week from
Friday....!

__________________________________________________________
Western Hangover

With one notable exception, peak power prices slackened across the WSCC on
the first day of trading in the New Year.  Mild coastal and southwestern
weather kept a lid on demand at the region's major load centers, while
generation output levels in California strengthened significantly in
comparison to the holiday doldrums.  Combined with the fact that spot gas
prices were weaker than they were on the last full day of trading, peak
power prices fell anywhere from .25 to 3$/MWh across the West on Wednesday.
The only anomaly in the West was the Central Rockies, where prices for peak
goods shot up by as much as 12.75$/MWh, with high end trades going through
at 37$/MWh.  ""I'm not sure why it was so expensive here today,"" responded
one trader to a request for an explanation. ""Temperatures are really cold,
and unit outages are up, but other than that, I wouldn't be able to guess.""
The low temperature in Denver was a frosty six degrees on Wednesday, though
the five-day forecast called for temperatures to warm into near normal
territory by Sunday.  Meanwhile, on NYMEX, Henry Hub natural gas futures
fell on Wednesday.  The February contract dropped 10.5 cents to settle at
2.465$/mmBtu, while March slid 11.7 cents to close at 2.443$/mmBtu.

Across the Northwest, peak power prices for Thursday delivery softened from
1.5 to 3$/MWh.  Peak goods changed hands from 22 to 24$/MWh.  Temperatures
were mild on Wednesday, and well above average west of the Cascades, with
highs in the low 50s and partly cloudy skies.  East of the Cascades
temperatures were near freezing but still slightly above normal, while the
five-day forecast called for temperatures to heat up slightly through
Sunday.  The latest six-to-ten predicted temperatures near to above normal
from January 8 to 12.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised
significantly upward over the long holiday weekend, coming in at 105 kcfs
Thursday and Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 110 kcfs Monday, and
105 kcfs Tuesday through next Wednesday.  In unit news, Montana coal-burner
Colstrip #4 (740 MW) returned to the grid Tuesday night after making
unplanned repairs.

As weather too warm to trigger heating demand lingered in the Golden State
and generation became healthier, power prices for Thursday delivery weakened
in the first trading session of 2002.  In a generally quiet, low-offer day,
market players reported trading at NP15 was especially light, as a soft spot
market in the Northwest pulled it down.  ""The market had a cautious tenor
today, but besides the new calendar there wasn't a particular reason for
 it,"" mentioned one undisturbed California marketer.  Peak goods at SP15
changed hands between 26.5 and 28.5$/MWh, with most deals done from 27 to
27.5$/MWh.  Light load pieces traded in a wider range from 19.5 to
23.25$/MWh, with unconfirmed trades heard as low as 18$/MWh.  A proposal for
more than 31 miles of new transmission lines in southern California, running
between the SCE grid and San Diego Gas & Electric, moved forward on
Wednesday.  The new capacity is needed to meet San Diego's swift-approaching
projected power shortfall.  Currently, the U.S. Department of the Interior
is studying the environmental effects of the proposal.  In unit news, a bevy
of returning units boosted generation in California.  Gas-fired Alamitos #6
(480 MW), Alamitos #4 (320 MW), El Segundo #3 (337 MW), and Morro Bay #4
(336 MW) were back in service on December 29, December 31, and the latter
two on January 1, respectively.  New additions to the out of service column
included Moss Landing #7 (739 MW) and Morro Bay #3 (337 MW).  Finally,
Calpine's Sutter Plants (546 MW) tripped off-line December 29, but was back
the following day.  Forecasts for Thursday called for above-normal
temperatures in the middle and northern sections of California, with highs
in the 57-59 degree range and lows around 50 degrees.  Los Angeles expected
highs in the mid-60s.  Little change was expected through the weekend across
the entire state, and the latest six-to-ten predicted above-normal
temperatures from January 8 to 12.

Despite a rash of unit outages, prices for peak goods weakened by up to
2$/MWh in the Southwest on milder weather and falling demand.  Peak pieces
at Palo Verde traded from 25 to 27.5$/MWh.  Temperatures across the region
hovered around normal, though the five-day forecast predicted some slight
cooling through Sunday.  The latest six-to-ten predicted temperatures to
remain near to above normal from January 8 through 12.  On the unit front,
coal unit Mohave #2 (442 MW) tripped off-line on December 27 for unplanned
repairs.  There was no ETR available.  Fellow coal-combustor Cholla #4 (375
MW) came off-line early January 1 for undisclosed reasons and was expected
back in a few days, while Navajo #3 (750 MW) came off line on New Year's Eve
with a tube leak but was back on-line by New Year's Day.  Meanwhile,
Coronado #1 (365 MW) continued to have problems with its main transformer.
It has been off the grid since December 22.

2954,"Oh wow - don't tell me you're a NUGGETS fan now! That is so wrong. I can't 
write for long just now because the ever-flourishing energy crisis is keeping 
us all very busy here at The Big Ron, as I so affectionately call it. Right 
now I'm on the cusp of either becoming a raging workaholic or cashing in my 
chips to become a professional beach bum. I know I already tried that and 
thought it wasn't for me, but trust me, one more month of this crap Portland 
weather and I'll ship myself right over to the Caribbean. And yes, I'm 
definitely coming to visit. It won't be for a couple months because this 
house move is going to set me back a bit. Let's just say I'm hoping I'll be 
so poor I'll be forced to lose weight in February. But I'm really excited - 
we move in on Friday - and the house is so cute. You have to at least come 
home to visit sometime so you can see it. I might even bring Kitty over, but 
Molly vehemently opposed the idea, and you know how Kitty doesn't like to be 
unsettled once she's staked her territory. (Big Kitty lives in daily fear.) 
Anyway, call me soon - you can call collect, or call and yelp into the phone 
and hang up - I'll know it's you and call back.

I'm stoked you're liking Denver - I really have to experience this ""Rocky 
Mountain High"" for myself. Please don't turn into a stoner ski bum and lose 
all fashion sense to the point of mistaking Patagonia and Tevas for catwalk 
wear. Hey, and you need to tell me more about this ""normal"" guy. You've got 
to watch out for those, you know - that's how the truly psycho ones disguise 
themselves. No, don't listen to me - I'll be bitter and single till I'm so 
old I have to get cats and live out my life like the crazy woman that I am. 
And this obsession with candles? You know you could head that off by setting 
up hundreds and hundreds of smoke alarms all over the house, or tell her that

2980,"I'm curious to know how my lack of recent correspondence translates to a 
neglect of my brainpower. If I didn't know better, I'd say that was a purely 
conceited statement. But, of course, being the buff brain-builder that I am, 
I know it's not.

So how are things ""down"" there in Seattle? I've been meaning to check in with 
you and Michael to make sure you didn't lose any limbs in the big Quake of 
'01. By the sounds of it you've been left with at least your digits and a 
little imagination, which isn't half bad compared to the poor capitol 
building in Olympia, whose crumbling edifice has turned into another of those 
perfunctory ""news"" stories begging the question, ""Just how much will I ever 
care?"" Last evening's t.v. news actually had the bad sense to show footage of 
city construction workers picking their noses atop the dome while a coiffed 
blonde anchorwoman alerted viewers to the ""urgency of the building's 
reconstruction"" due to its ""inability to be inhabited until 2003."" Is it just 
me, or do t.v. newspeople seem to act stupid on purpose?

Speaking of stupid, what exactly is walpurgis night? And the Pogues? I 
realize I'm showing my lack of culture here, but curiosity always overtakes 
my elegant facade sooner or later. Speaking of elegant, we're having another 
party! And Amber might actually show up for this one, being that it's purpose 
is to celebrate her birthday. First weekend in April, April 7 to be exact, 
we'll be the proud hostesses of a 25th birthday/costume party. I'd love for 
you and Michael to grace us with your presence, but it sounds like you'll be 
halfway across the globe by then. If plans change, and for your sake I 
certainly hope they don't, give us a call or just drop in on the 7th.

I've got to run - there are energy crises to be mitigated, you know. But drop 
me a message before you take off for wine country. And watch out for falling 
pieces of crumbling buildings.

I've visited with almost every department in our office trying to figure out 
what happened to this deal. Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the 
Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So 
Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he 
found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which 
they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the 
schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to 
Idaho in the hour-ahead market. 

Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better 
if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and 
kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation 
of what happened)? Just let me know, and we'll do what we can to help.

touch yet, and I can give you all the excuses in the book about how I've been 
swamped with work, play, life in general, but we both know I'm just flaky, so 
there's no point in explaining it.

Anyway, I'm so excited to hear you're doing well in your new Rocky Mountain 
dwelling, but you left me here with no good pissing and moaning (and getting 
""pissed"") buddies. So I checked out airfares to Denver, and found one for 
$118 roundtrip! Can you freakin' believe it? Anyway, you have to purchase and 
use the ticket by the end of March, so I was thinking a little spring break 
action was called for. Do you think you'd be settled enough by the end of 
March to accomodate a portly older sister for a few days? Let me know, and 
I'll do the deal.

Got to go - business abounds at Enron as usual. I'll try to drop you a line 
tonight when I have more time to write. Do you have a phone number? Amber was 
in Denver over the weekend, and she and Monica called me trying to get ahold 
of you, but I had no idea where to look. (Except somewhere in Denver, but 
from what I've heard it's a fairly big place.)

Write back soon, or call - I want to know how the internship is. But more 
importantly, how's the unlimited Starbucks coffee?

to them. The deal was originally 25 mw on peak, but was cut about 10 mw each 
hour. That's why each hour now shows 15 mw and some scraps. The remainder of 
the schedule we sold in the hour ahead market. This is a typical maneuver

Greg and Bill will be focussing on in 2001.  The first is the management of 
EPMI's physical power flows.  This entails checking out with counterparties, 
handling cuts, and ensuring that all of our risk and settlement systems

Time group.  Each day, our Real Time desk combs the market looking for 
attractive trading opportunities.  The third area is the Services Desk.  The 
Services Desk provides scheduling and settlements services to customers who 
don't have the staff or systems to do it themselves.  We have seen our 
Services business grow dramatically this year.

Greg Wolfe will be ultimately responsible for the efforts of the Real Time 
desk and our Services business.  Les Rawson will continue in his role on the

with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is 
concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski trip 
this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside, let 
alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're totally 
used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied by sun and 
not eternal grayness. 

Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber out, 
but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever 
possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out, 
and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is 
foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course 
there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got 
to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore. 

I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE 
our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to Denver, 
or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either way, I'll 
definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs, friends (or 
not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and hustle so I can

confirmation to control over other evidence.

Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master 
agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions 
should not be included when they determine their rights to call for 
collateral under the masters.

I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.  Is 
this particular to credit derivatives?

With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that 
these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by 
the Mater User.  It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the 
authority to amend the ETA.  Is the purpose of the second sentence to 
""deactivate"" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction?  
If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a 
master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected 
counterparties.  (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty 
execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC 
would acknowledge that the master did not control.)

I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy 
Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is 
impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.  If we 
actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have 
the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods 
for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to 
more than 60 days).

I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term ""Month.""  What would the Effective 
Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?  You could argue that 
it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March.  
The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day 
convention.

This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives  -  should we apply a 
different interest rate to non-US$ payments?

It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives 
trading agreements be subject to arbitration.  We rarely submit to the 
jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the 
US.  Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some 
straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.

Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we 
decided not to include one here for a particular reason?

Again. sorry for the delay.  I will be here all week and happy to discuss any 
of these points.

 - THE SPECIAL CASE OF INITIAL COLLATERAL.doc",,,
3075,"Bob / Mark,

Since our recent discussions over the above, I have checked the situation out 
extensively with the OMLX and it appears that the best solution would now be 
the following:

1. Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (""ECTRIC""), the 
Delaware incorporated company, becomes  a member of the OMLX (either as a 
pure Proprietary trader or as  a Market Maker - see point (a) below - Bob you 
need to advise me what you want here).

2. Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited (""EEFT""), the English SFA-regulated 
company which acts as agent / arranger for ECTRIC, then, via EEFT's staff in 
London, places ECTRIC's bids / offers onto the Pulpex Index in the name of 
and for the account of ECTRIC.  Acting purely in this ""arranging"" manner, 
EEFT itself would not be a member of the OMLX in any capacity.

3. Please note that if Steve is going to be the EEFT person in London who 
would place such orders onto Pulpex in the name of, and for the account of,  
ECTRIC, then Steve will need to become a ""Registered Representative"" of EEFT 
with the SFA before he can place such orders.  As you know, this status may 
either be gained by Steve passing an examination or by certain length of 
experience in the market.  I shall need to sort this out with Steve if you 
decide to do this.

4. Once EEFT has placed a bid / offer onto the Exchange in the name of, and 
for the account of, ECTRIC as the Member, if that gets ""hit"", then we can 
give-up that contract immediately to ENA's account under the Exchange's 
give-up procedure.          

Points to note:

(a) ECTRIC could join the OMLX as either a Market Maker or as a Proprietary 
Trader.  Clearly, if ECTRIC joined as a Market Maker, ECTRIC (through EEFT in 
London) would be obliged to make firm two way bids / offers for 2 1/4 hours 
during market opening hours - but so would ENA out of Houston which also has 
Market Maker status. Hence, Enron would have two sets of MM obligations, one 
with ENA and the other with ECTRIC (through EEFT in London).  Bob - Do you 
want this??  Or would you prefer to leave the Market Making obligations with 
ENA and just have ECTRIC as a Proprietary Trader??  The Exchange (Derek 
Oliver) assures me that that there is no difference in the information 
available to MMs as opposed to Prop Traders and Prop Traders can post bids 
and offers as well as hit others bids and offers.  The only difference 
therefore is that a Prop Trader  does not have the obligation to post bids 
and offers during market hours.  Please let me know.

(b) If we go this route, the OMLX would like comfort from ECTRIC's external 
US counsel  that ECTRIC would not be in breach of any US regulations by 
adopting the above structure.  In obtaining this advice, we shall need to 
bear in mind whether, in acting on behalf of ECTRIC, EEFT in London will 
place orders by electronic link or  by telephonic link (as is presently the 
case from Houston).  Mark, are you able to obtain this advice??  Please let 
me know.

(c)   From discussions with Jannine of Tax Dept., there are tax implications 
to any form of trading through London for the US, although these are not 
insurmountable.  Jannine will no doubt write you a separate e-mail with 
regard to the cost of doing such business from a Tax perspective and you 
should bear the contents of that in mind before deciding whether or not to 
proceed.  

Kind regards

3076,"As noted in the ""checklist"" for the draft master netting form, the current form of the document does not include any crossborder issues/review, but just highlights the issue.  The master netting arrangements crossborder would need to be scrubbed for insolvency/preference/safe harbor etc. rules, as well as tax matters.  We were able to get comfortable to cross into Canada on the PGE transactions, but there were extra matters that had to be handled in respect of Canada/US tax issues.  I cannot offhand remember the resolution.  Suffice to say, if the credit benefit warrants an aggregation of contracts crossborder, then due diligence for legal and tax would need to be undertaken.  ISDA opinions may be helpful, or at least a place to begin.

3100,"We are putting together a college football pool that will run every week as well as keep an ongoing cumulative score.  The tentative plan is to have it be $100/man paid upfront with weekly payouts of 50% of the pot for the high score and rolling the other 50% of the pot into the cumulative total which pays out 3 places for the whole season (Sep 1 - Nov 24).  You will pick 5 games per week assigning each game a priority of 1-5.  All games will have the line as set by the friday edition of the U.S. Today.  The scoring will then be based on the priority values, e.g. If my 5, 3, and 2 priority games win I score 10 points for the week.   The weekly payout will be 100% to 1st place unless there is a tie, the total difference between your scores and the lines for all 5 games will be used to decide the winner.  The cumulative payout will be 50% for 1st, 30% for 2nd, and 20% for 3rd, of the remaining pot.   

We are hoping to get at least 20 people which would be like $75/week and have $1000 left in the pot at the end for the cumulative leaders.  If you are interested let me know asap and also, invite whoever else you can think of, the more the better and we can maybe get the weekly payout to be more than the $100 entry fee.  ",,100 1000,

 Supper on Thursday sounds great.   We can plan to eat right after
your meetings end.  I will get tickets for the play Thursday night if you
are interested (I still go to all the plays - If you're not interested, I'll
just go on Sunday).  I'm looking forward to getting together again (I can
show you our new NMR).
 If I can do a little campaigning - don't repeat what I say here, I
don't want to get in any trouble.  I'm enclosing the brief notes from a
science building meeting last fall about the campaign.  We hope the campaign
isn't just about bricks and mortar.  It would be a great opportunity to
strengthen the sciences.  #'s 1, 2 and 3 below were particularly important
to many people.  #1 is getting scholarship money to attract good students
into the sciences.  #2 is endowment for equipment (we have a growing
endowment in chemistry and biology - I'll tell you about it when you are
here).  It is just that science has become very expensive and we would like
for this endowment to grow.  #3 is just to look at remodeling the science
building - chemistry doesn't need this as much as biology and psychology.  I
don't want you to push for these particular things - they would know you had
been lobbied!!  It is just that I hope there will be some attempt to
strengthen academics in the campaign - I'm also aware that some of our
requests may not be the most fundable items.  It is always easier to raise
big money on bricks and mortar.

EnronOnline to Australia. I'm not sure how close you want to follow progress 
but I'll copy you in until you say to stop .

 There are no  regulatory or contractual concerns that might delay 
implementation . However, there will need to be some more work on regulatory 
issues when we extend EnronOnline to non-electricity commodity derivatives.   

Last year I drafted GTCs for Power trades and amended the Password Agreement 
and ETA. These are with outside counsel for external review. 

If there are going to be any legal issues they are more likely to be on 
procedural matters. For example it is not clear yet which office 
counterparties wishing to open an account will call. If it is not here then 
we will need to develop a protocol to ensure legislative requirements in 
checking potential counterparties are followed.

Thanks for the information and access id's. 

As I indicated in my voice mail earlier today, the standard process is to run 
these deals through one central point and to ensure that a review of all 
descriptions and information related to each respective product to be traded 
is undertaken by a Legal Dept. member.   As you will note from the list of 
cc's, I have included legal dept. members involved in the physical power, 
physical gas and financial products areas.  These people will need to review 
the product definitions/descriptions - if any - on the Tradequote site, as 
well as any other items associated with these products.  Accordingly, each of 
these individuals also needs a password/user id for due diligence purposes.

I have almost completed my review of the Access Agreement and the other 
documents on the site (available without a password).  I can complete the 
review process only after Brent, Dan and Shari have completed their on-line 
product reviews and provided any comments.

number of considerations. once we form our legal view, trading, credit, 
accounting etc. would need to be involved. elizabeth we obviously have the

3121,"I've gone back through the ISDA Credit Support Annex and the ""green book"" and 
my conclusion is that unless we modify the standard form, we have to give an 
Independent Amount back to the counterparty when we go out of the money far 
enough (note that the definition of Exposure results in a negative number 
when we are out of the money reducing the Credit Support Amount below the 
Independent Amount).  The theory there is that as the market moves against 
us, we are cushioned by our ""out-of-the-moneyness"" and will be able to ask 
for support as the market moves back in our favor before we are actually in 
the money.  I'm afraid that Credit has been operating under the assumption 
that we get to keep Independent Amounts until the Transaction terminates.  We 
need to set up a system with Credit so we all know what is meant on the 
credit work sheets -- i.e. whether a cushion or up-front amount should be 
given back to the counterparty as we go out of the money or not (maybe the 
paralegals can suggest something?).  I suggest we add the following language 
(taken from the green book) when we are using Paragraph 13 and Credit tells 
us they don't want to have to give the cushion amount back, no matter how far 
we go out of the money:

 ""Credit Support Amount"" will mean the higher of (i) the amount calculated as 
provided in the definition of that
  term in Paragraph 3(b) and (ii) the sum of the Pledgor's Independent 
Amounts.

I will modify the Force Energy document to include it and, unless you would 
like to suggest alternative language, ask Tana to add it to our list of 
alternatives for Paragraph 13.",Tana,,the ISDA Credit Support Annex the Credit Support Amount Credit Independent Amounts

3133,"NOAA ANNOUNCES NEW ""ENVIRONOMICS"" PROGRAM THAT 
LINKS WEATHER, CLIMATE TO ECONOMY
Data Show Effect of Climate Conditions on Corn and Soybean Yield
and Residential Energy Needs
October 24, 2001 - NOAA <http://www.noaa.gov/> today unveiled two new indices that evaluate the effect of climate conditions on corn and soybean yield and on residential energy needs. The development of the indices is part of NOAA's ""Environomics"" program <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/environomics/environomics.html>, an effort to better understand the impact of weather and climate on socioeconomic sectors of the nation. The indices were developed by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html> in Asheville, N.C., which maintains the world's largest weather database. (Click NOAA image for larger view of standardized temperature index for Sept. 2001.)
Anecdotal statements about the weather are often used to explain variations in economic activity, and these statements are often based on perceptions about the weather that may or may not be valid. Through NOAA's Environomics program, relationships between the nation's climate and vital economic sectors of the nation are clearly defined using climate indices, which enhance the understanding of how year-to-year variations and trends in weather and climate affect associated sectors.
Thomas Karl <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/about/welcomefromdirector.html>, director of NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, said, ""Climate indices developed through the Environomics program provide quantitative information regarding climate's influence while providing historical perspective on how weather and climate conditions affecting our economy and society today compare with conditions of the past.""
The period of high energy demand and prices of the late 1970s coincided with extremely cold winters that contributed to higher residential energy usage. The Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI), which provides information related to climate sensitive residential energy demand, reflects this increased demand through historically high index values and can be used in part to explain the cause of the historically high energy demand of that time. By providing continuing updates to the index, a clearer understanding of future fluctuations in energy demand will be possible.
The REDTI tracks both unusually hot and unusually cold conditions. It varies from year to year due to variability and trends in temperature, and it responds most strongly to temperature conditions in heavily populated regions. REDTI values range from 0 to 100. Values greater than 90 indicate a much above average temperature-related energy demand and values less than 10 reflect much below average conditions.
The REDTI for the 2001 April-September season was 34, indicative of slightly below average residential energy demand for cooling and heating. Based on the 107 year record, the population-weighted REDTI value of 34 ranks as the 19th lowest value.
The nation's warm season (April-September) 2001 ranked as the fourth warmest such period since 1895, the first year of complete climate records. The preliminary national average temperature was 67.4 F (19.7 C), which was 1.6 F (0.9 C) above the long-term mean. Although the area-weighted national temperature gave the season a rank of fourth warmest on record, the persistence of average to cooler than average temperatures in some of the most heavily populated regions of the U.S. contributed to a REDTI that was below average. Energy usage statistics for 2001 will be available from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration in 2002.
While the REDTI provides information on the impacts of temperature on energy demand, the Moisture Stress Index (MSI), was developed to quantify the effect of soil moisture conditions on crop yield. It provides historical perspective on conditions such as moisture stress, that are closely associated with corn and soybean yields and is a source of information for explaining the cause of lower national yields.
The MSI ranges from zero to 100 and specifically measures the proportion of the nation's corn or soybeans affected by severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness. Values near zero indicate that few productive corn or soybean growing areas were affected by severe drought or catastrophic wetness. This index reflects conditions during July and August and is weighted by the mean (1991-2000) annual crop productivity within 344 climate divisions in the contiguous U.S. Although a number of factors affect the success of a single crop growing season, drought or excessive wetness during critical phases of crop growth have a significant impact on the nation's corn and soybean yield.
Although warmer than average temperatures coincided with drought in some parts of the country during the warm season months of 2001, conditions in the heart of the major corn and soybean crop growing regions were generally normal to wetter than normal. The corn MSI for the 2001 crop growing season was eight, and the soybeans MSI was seven. This means that severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness affected only 8 percent and 7 percent of the nation's corn and soybeans, respectively. Both index values were below average and reflect favorable soil moisture throughout a large part of the crop growing regions during July and August (the reproductive season).
The MSI for corn exceeded 40 during the drought-plagued growing seasons of 1983 and 1988 and 30 during the catastrophically wet summer of 1993, years in which corn yields were less than 75 percent of the 2000 yield. The 2001 growing season (May-September) followed several years in which national corn and soybean yields were generally high, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The low values of this year's corn and soybean MSI indicate that conditions associated with this index were again favorable for good corn and soybean yields. National crop yields for 2001 will be available from the United States Department of Agriculture following the harvest season.

3134,"Just wanted to say Hi, I know  you are at work but had to share something.
About two weeks ago, we had to go to dinner at the Peabody with some business
people in town and Jeff introduced me to someone named Cam Smith.  Jeff had
told me he was from Cleveland, MS and his dad was Dr. Smith, OK I put it
together it was Bruce Orman's nephew,  Ok I feel really old NOW!!   He is
young starting out with this particular company that sells to Jeff.  Anyway,
he remembered you and said he always liked you so much.  He gave me scoop on
Bruce and Nancy about moving to Oxford, etc.  He was really nice and quite
country talking but he is married and lives somewhere north of Memphis in Tn.
    What a small world.   Just think you could be living in Oxford town with
that Postmaster!! H A! Just kidding, I would love to see you soon.  Maybe I
can visit you one day.   CT",Jeff Cam Smith Smith Bruce Orman's Nancy,,MS Oxford

To give you an indication of the current value of your generation,  San Juan 
offers are running about NYMEX less $.20/MMBtu for most forward months.  That 
puts the fixed price about $5.50 - $5.75.  Peak Palo Verde Bids are

Q3 - $520
Q4 - $190
Q1 2001 - $125

It looks like you are in the money at least through the end of the year.

We have been looking at the transmission issue.  What substation would you be 
able to deliver to?  We can determine if transmission is available.  

Irrespective of availability, I still believe Salt River or APS will be the 
best physical bid for your energy as they can keep it in their system and 
avoid transmission.  

I would like to push forward to get ISDA swap contracts in place with BHP.  I 
remember losing a deal with Francis Mcalister a few years ago despite being a 
better offer because contracts were not in place.  Enron North America does 
not have an ISDA with BHP.  We could also push to get a physical electricity 
contract in place.  I think we have a physical gas contract.

Would you like to push ahead to get contracts in place?  Let me know.  It is 
not too early to start the process as it typically takes a month or so to 
make it happen.  What would be the name of the counterparty?  You are the US 
subsidiary of BHP correct?

Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that are fixed will not include TW transport charges.

Thanks again,

ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into the system?
