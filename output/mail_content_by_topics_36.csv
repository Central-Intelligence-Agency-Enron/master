 I want to speak to Wade myself.  He can call me at work or home. Or if you 
email me his number I will call him.  
 I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him 
work orders for normal maintenance.

 I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office.  Do you need Mary 
to come in on any more Fridays?  I think I 
 can guess your answer.

 I might stop by this Friday.

If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6 
or 12 months.  6 month payout would be $190/month.  
12 month payout would be $95/month.  Your choice.  I would like it if you 
could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so.  Does $10/hr sound 
fair?  We can apply it to the loan.

Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position 
and p&l reporting for the west desk.
My underlying goal is to create position managers and p&l reports that 
represent all the risk held by the desk
and estimate p&l with great accuracy.


Let's try and schedule a meeting for this Wednesday to go over the items 
above.

That is good news about Leander.  

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   
However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on.  

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this 
Friday.

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email 
with comments.

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I 
have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out 
tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility 
connections?  Other rezoning costs?  

What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

89,"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

happen.? When you throw the  ball 58 times with a 62% completion percentage=
,=20
great things happen.? Look  for more of the same.

QB Kerry Collins (NYG)? The  Giants may be struggling but Collins continues=
=20
to put up excellent Fantasy  Football numbers.? With guys like Kurt Warner=
=20
and Daunte Culpepper, it's  easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs=
=20
come from great teams.? Not  always the case as Collins is showing.? Often=
=20
times, it's teams with  vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco=
=20
that provides the QB  motivation to play catch-up.? Collins looks comfortab=
le=20
in the pocket and  if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike=20
Hilliard healthy for four  quarters, who knows what might happen.

QB Brett Favre (GB)? He's  baaaaack.? I said last week that Favre coming ba=
ck=20
on the bad foot would be  storybook material for a storybook kind of guy an=
d=20
Favre delivered.? 2 TDs  and 301 yards have the Packers riding high and=20
believing they can?make some  noise.? WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an=20
excellent #2 WR and RB Ahman Green  is filling the void left by Dorsey=20
Levens.?=20

QB Aaron Brooks (NO)? I may be  in the minority (imagine that...) but I was=
=20
very impressed with Brooks taking  over for Jeff Blake.? He was not a #2 QB=
=20
like Jim Miller in Chicago that  knew he'd be inserted any minute.? Brooks=
=20
was thrust into the game and  responded very nicely.? He's skinny at #205 b=
ut=20
tall (6' 4"")? Big  league arm and nice mobility.? Of particular note was hi=
s=20
tendency to throw  to WR Willie Jackson.? We'll see if that continues.? Sur=
e,=20
he's a long  shot but if you're desperate for a QB, he could be a nice =20
surprise.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD)? Hold the  presses, Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade=
=20
list.? Seriously, he's an  easy target and I'll admit to taking my share of=
=20
shots but you can't deny the  guy has skills.? Yes, there were some fluky=
=20
plays with Crockett injuring  himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw=
.?=20
(although the 3 TDs on 13  completions did make for a wild looking box scor=
e=20
for Leaf)? He's got some  weapons in Jeff Graham, Curtis Conway and his bes=
t=20
receiver, TE Freddie  Jones.? He's as flaky as they come but he might be=20
worth a look if you're  dying at QB.

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Fred Taylor (Jac)? Taylor  put together one of the best performances of=
=20
the year Sunday night.? The  fact that he did it against the very tough rus=
h=20
defense of the Steelers makes it  even all the more impressive.? This isn't=
=20
like rolling up 200 yards on the  Cowboys or Cardinals.? Clearly, there's=
=20
reason for huge hope as if he can  do this against Pittsburgh, he can do it=
=20
against anyone.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? Once  again, Lewis ran hard.? He's got to be consider=
ed=20
one of the better RBs in  the game right now.? I still worry about how=20
durable he'll be but he's  looked great lately averaging 6.7 yards per carr=
y=20
Sunday for 187 yards.? If  it weren't for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturin=
g=20
a TD here and there, he'd be  even higher.

RB Darnell Autry (Phi)? Autry  refuses to hand over the #1 RB job to Stanle=
y=20
Pritchett or anyone else.?  He's not very flashy but he gets the job done=
=20
both rushing and receiving.?  The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in=
=20
the standings and Autry figures to  be a large part of that success.

RB Ahman Green (GB)? I'd be a  little worried right now if I were Dorsey=20
Levens.? Green averaged 6.4 yards  per carry Sunday as he rolled up 180 tot=
al=20
yards.? Most importantly, was  his number of fumbles: Zero.? No one's ever=
=20
doubted his incredible physical  skills, but now he seems to be bringing th=
e=20
mental game to go with  it.

RB Mike Anderson (Den)? I hate  to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a grea=
t=20
impression of Isaac Bruce's  maddening 1998 on again, off again season.? As=
=20
you know, Davis missed  another game and once again, Anderson stepped in=20
nicely.?? By now, you  know it's tough to predict what Davis is going to do=
=20
each week so it looks to me  as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup.

RB Jamal Anderson (Atl)?  Anderson's 4.5 yards per carry reminded many of h=
is=20
1998 season.? He's  running with power and speed and finally appears to be=
=20
over the knee  injury.? I think he's been over it physically for a while no=
w=20
but it seems  he's handling the mental aspect too.

?

WRs Moving Up

WR Willie Jackson (NO)? New QB  Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being=20
thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson  responded well with 4 catches and=
=20
85 yards including 2 TDs.? Often times,  you'll see a backup QB favor the=
=20
backup WRs as they're familiar with them.?  We'll see if this continues.? I=
'm=20
guessing Brooks will get comfortable  throwing to Joe Horn this week but=20
Jackson is still definitely worth a  shot.

WR Joe Jurevicius (NYG)? As I  mentioned above, QB Kerry Collins is playing=
=20
very well. With Ike Hilliard set to  miss some time, Jurevicius should get =
a=20
chance to show what he can do.?  He's long been a Fantasy Football tease=20
showing flashes but never really having  the opportunity for playing time.?=
=20
Let's see what he can  do.

WR Terry Glenn (NE)? I've  been?high on Glenn since June.? He made me look=
=20
good early on but had  cooled midseason.? He's now back warming up again an=
d=20
for you Glenn owners,  your patience is paying off.? QB Drew Bledsoe didn't=
=20
have a TD, but he did  roll up the yards.? Once again, Glenn was the prime =
=20
target.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)? Smith  looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as=
=20
the Jags awakened their  offense?Sunday night.? Smith seems back in synch=
=20
with QB Mark Brunell  and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game.=
?=20
There may not be  enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enoug=
h=20
for  Smith.

WR James McNight (Dal)? Yes,  he's a long shot considering the horrid play =
of=20
Troy Aikman Sunday but you have  to like a WR who's getting a ton of looks.=
?=20
And McNight's getting those  looks from Aikman.? Can't make plays without t=
he=20
ball...

?

TEs Moving Up

TE Jay Reimersma (Buf)? We've  been waiting for Reimersma to return to form=
=20
and he looks to be on his  way.? He was heavily involved and seemed=20
comfortable with ""new"" QB Rob  Johnson.? He can be a vital part of the=20
offense and you have to think  Johnson will continue to utilize him.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)? Mangum's  no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a=
=20
nice target.? 4 catches for 47  yards is an improvement from what they've h=
ad=20
at TE and it looks like he's back  and healthy now.

?

Players Moving  Down

?

QBs Moving Down

QB Steve Beuerlein (Car)?  There's only so much a QB can do by himself.? He=
=20
lost Wesley Walls a couple  of weeks ago. I thought Beuerlein could handle=
=20
losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but  losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injur=
y=20
proved too much.? His OL is less  than stellar and he's just not having muc=
h=20
time to throw.? =20

QB Shaun King (TB)? King swings  back toward the side of mediocrity after a=
=20
91 yard passing effort against  Chicago.? It looked that bad too.? Even for=
 a=20
Les Steckel  Offense.? Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a=
=20
positive as  teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson.

QB Steve McNair (Ten)? Not all  the turnovers Sunday were McNair's fault bu=
t=20
he certainly had a hand in  them.? His problem remains a lack of healthy WR=
s=20
and a stellar RB in Eddie  George who can carry the load.? Last year, it wa=
s=20
McNair vulturing TDs from  George but it doesn't seem to be a problem this=
=20
year.?=20

QB Jake Plummer (Ari)? If  you're a regular reader, you know I'm not a=20
Plummer fan.? I'm especially  not a fan now that he's hurt as well.? He may=
=20
get back soon but it won't  matter for this team that's in shambles=20
offensively.

?

RBs Moving Down

RB Thomas Jones (Ari)? Jones'  was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but=20
still, you like to see a better yards  per carry average than negative 2...

RB Kevin Faulk (NE)? Either  Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is=
=20
not a very good football  player.? How else do you explain Faulk earning on=
e=20
carry while his RB  partner J.R. Redmond was inactive?? Patrick Pass got th=
e=20
bulk of the work  but was ineffective.? I'm guessing, it's the fumbling tha=
t=20
earned his spot  in the doghouse.?=20

RB Ron Dayne (NYG)? As we've  said so often in the past, Ron Dayne's=20
productivity is tied directly to how well  the Giants are playing.? If New=
=20
York is leading, you'll see Dayne.? If  they're trailing, it's the Tiki=20
Barber show.? Lately, it's been more Tiki  than Dayne.? And if the Giants=
=20
don't make some improvements on defense, I  don't see that changing.

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)?  Prentice got folks excited early in the year but=
=20
he's been disappointing of  late.? Prentice is losing carries to Jamel Whit=
e=20
and that doesn't look to  change anytime soon.?=20

?

WRs Moving Down

WR Marcus Robinson (Chi)?  Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it=
=20
appears the QB rotation is  affecting his play.? With Shane Matthews=20
starting, Robinson had 5  receptions for 53 yards.? While those numbers are=
=20
certainly not horrible,  they're not quite what we expect from Marcus.? He=
=20
could improve with  another week of practice but I'm a little concerned rig=
ht=20
now.

WR Joe Horn (NO)? As I  mentioned above, I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but=
=20
there is no way that he's  anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff=
=20
Blake.? Of special worry was  the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable=20
throwing the ball to Willie  Jackson.

WR Donald Hayes?(Car)?  Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his statu=
s=20
for next week is  uncertain.? He's a vital part of the offense and will be=
=20
missed if he can't  go.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ)? As the  Jets have struggled, so has Chrebet.? He=20
turned in another small game  Sunday with 22 yards on 2 catches.? These=20
numbers just won't get it done  for a #1 WR.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)? 2 weeks  ago, it was Amani Toomer taking the hard=20
shot.? Last week it was Hilliard  with the highlight hit.? He looks like he=
=20
may miss a game or two which is  bad news for Hilliard owners but good news=
=20
of Joe Jurevicius  owners.

?

TEs Moving Down

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl)? Kelly's  just too up and down to rely on to any=20
degree.? When he's featured in the  gameplan, he's?a nice player and can be=
=20
effective.? It's just that  it's so hard to guess what game that will be...

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ)? Another  Jet receiver that's struggling.? Becht is=
=20
frustrating as he'll show some  nice flashes and then disappear for long=20
stretches.? I'm afraid to say he's  starting to look like...a Jet's TE.

Beer! Banjos! Bock! Bluegrass!   
If you love bluegrass, the Grateful Dead, or both, this is the event for you.  If you loved the soundtrack to ""Deliverance"" but could do without the ""Squeal like a pig"", this is the event for you.  If you look forward to the rollout of Spring Bock every year, this is the event for you.  If you like yummy Tex-Mex, this is the event for you. 

This Friday night, January 18 at the Garden in the Heights, the Yonder Mountain String Band will be performing (inside the Beer Hall in all likelihood).  This band takes bluegrass to a new level and has been known to jam on one song for an hour.  They just sold out the Fillmore in San Francisco (the Mecca of Bluegrass - OK, perhaps not, but they do like good music there) two nights in a row.  Come out and join us (overalls not necessary).  This email is good for $2 off the admission ticket. 

When: Friday, January 18 
Time: 6:30  Doors open 
      7:00  Billy Bright Band (opening act) 
      9:00  Yonder Mountain String Band (they're doing 2 sets - you'll get your moneys' worth) 
Where: Garden in the Heights, 3926 Feagan 
Admission: $10 with this email, otherwise $12 at the door

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee Titans quarterback Steve McNair missed
practice Thursday for the third straight day because of back spasms and is
questionable for Saturday's game against Oakland.

""There are concerns,"" coach Jeff Fisher said. ""He hasn't responded like we'd
hoped. He's still pretty stiff.""

McNair first experienced some stiffness in his lower back late last week. In
the first quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles
tightened up. However, he stayed in the game and led the Titans to a 26-20
victory.

Even McNair is unsure of his status for Saturday night.

""If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it,"" he said. ""I'm
very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time the spasms have
stayed longer than I anticipated.""

McNair has been questionable numerous times this season with shoulder,
ankle, thumb and elbow injuries. However, he missed just one game, and is
now producing the best statistics of his career.

**********  Our View  **************

Jeff Fisher is probably the least forthcoming of any NFL coach outside of
Mike Shanahan.   Clearly, it doesn't sound good.   But McNair is a guy who
seems to always be a stretch to play and then he goes out and does well (at
least lately)   I honestly don't have any more info that what's reported
above.   It would be my suggestion that if you have a good alternative, you
look hard at him as it's awfully murky for McNair right now.

Joe

114," Tipper Gore, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered
 that her husband's great-great uncle, Gunther Gore, a fellow
 lacking in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train
 robbery in Tennessee in 1889.

 The only known photograph of Gunther shows him standing
 on the gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription:
 ""Gunther Gore; horse thief, sent to Tennessee Prison 1885,
 escaped 1887, robbed the Tennessee Flyer six times. Caught
 by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.""

 After letting Al Gore and his staff of professional image
 consultants peruse the findings, they decided to crop Gunther's
 picture, scan it in as an enlarged image, and edited it with
 image processing software so that all that's seen is a head shot.

 The accompanying biographical sketch was sent to the
 Associated Press as follows:

 ""Gunther Gore was a famous
 rancher in early Tennessee history. His business empire
 grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets
 and intimate dealings with the Tennessee railroad.
 Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to
 service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume
 his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in
 a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective
 Agency. In 1889, Gunther passed away during an important
 civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which
 he was standing, collapsed.""

124,"Hi Folks,

Once again, our Footballguy Scott Luebke throws out what he sees for this
week's Upgrades and Downgrades.

Enjoy.

Joe

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Upgrades

QB - Tom Brady - Brady has remains the starter in New England despite the
return of Drew Bledsoe from injury.  Some analysts may question the fact
that Bledsoe lost his job due to an injury, but no one can question Brady's
effectiveness on the football field.  A 258 yard, 4 touchdown performance
keeps Brady entrenched as the Patriots starter.  Keep in mind, the Patriots
have a bye in week 16.

QB - Kordell Stewart - Stewart looked good on Sunday with his second
consecutive multiple touchdown game.  Stewart finished the game with 254
passing yards, 54 rushing yards and 3 total touchdowns.  The schedule looks
good for Stewart down the stretch, especially with games against Detroit and
Cincinnati in weeks 15 and 16.

QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler has found a quality weapon in rookie Chris
Chambers.  Fiedler has been an up and down quarterback this season, but his
upside is good.  A quality schedule throughout the remainder of the season
should allow ample opportunity for solid fantasy stats.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van
Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to
match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against
weaker opponents.  Look for another quality performance against the 49ers
this weekend.

RB - Dominic Rhodes - With Edgerrin James sidelined for the season, Rhodes
has been asked to do a lot in the Colts offense.  He produced on Sunday with
147 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  Two consecutive difficult games against
Baltimore and Miami will slow Rhodes down, but a strong finish to the season
is in store.  With Manning and the passing game throwing interceptions, look
for Coach Mora to run a more conservative offense featuring Rhodes.

RB - Antowain Smith - Smith jumps into the upgrades category once again with
153 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  However, now is the time to trade Smith
away.  His value has hit an all-time high and the remainder of the season
will be difficult with Cleveland, Miami and a bye week remaining.

RB - Ahman Green - Green has struggled the last few weeks, but was able to
bust out on Thanksgiving Day with 150 total yards and 2 scores.  Look for
the Green Bay offense to revolve around Green for the remainder of the
season.  As the winter weather approaches, Favre and the passing game will
become more conservative, which will result in more dump off passes to the
talented Green.  Don't be surprised if Green receives 30+ touches/game the
remainder of the season.

RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson's statistics have suffered over the
last several weeks with the opposition focusing on the run.  In order to get
the ball in Tomlinson's hands more often, Turner called several short
passing plays to get LT in the open field.  The plan was successful as
Tomlinson caught 13 passes for 72 yards.  The fantasy playoffs look good for
Tomlinson with Oakland, Kansas City and Seattle on the schedule for weeks
14, 15, and 16.

RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst looked strong again on Sunday with 106 rushing
yards and 2 touchdowns.  In the last 4 games, Hearst has averaged 106
rushing yards/game.  With rookie Kevan Barlow separating his shoulder on
Sunday to go along with an already injured quad, Hearst will continue to see
20+ touches per game and be a quality fantasy option in the fantasy playoffs
as long as he remains healthy.

WR - Derrick Alexander - Good news for Alexander owners...it appears that he
is 100% healthy for the first time this season.

WR - Eric Moulds - Throughout the week, Moulds was complaining about the
lack of balls thrown in his direction and how the team was using him.  Well,
the complaint department contacted management and Moulds got the ball.  What
happened when the ball was thrown to Moulds?  He produced (196 yards and 2
touchdowns).

WR - Chris Chambers - The talented rookie struck once again on Sunday with
101 receiving yards and 2 fabulous touchdowns.  Chambers is the big play
threat in the Miami offense and should continue to see action.  Keep in
mind, Chambers is a boom/bust option at receiver.  He'll dazzle you one week
and disappear the next week.  This guy is going to be special, so grab him
in dynasty leagues.

WR - David Boston - Plain and simple...the man.  A few weeks ago, the knock
on Boston was his lack of touchdown scoring.  Well, 4 touchdowns in 3 weeks
should quiet the critics.

WR - Kevin Johnson - Johnson jumped back in the scoring column on Sunday
with 113 yards and a touchdown.  Johnson is Tim Couch's clear cut #1
receiver and should remain a consistent fantasy threat for the rest of the
season.

WR - Troy Brown - Brown continues to produce quality numbers on a consistent
basis.  With 7 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown on Sunday, Brown
continues to have a quality rapport with QB Tom Brady.  Keep in mind, New
England has a bye in week 16, so Brown will not be available for the
majority of championship games.  Plan accordingly.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downgrades

QB - Trent Green - Green's disappointing season continues.  He looked good
with 256 passing yards and zero interceptions on Sunday.  However, he was
unable to throw any touchdowns and that stat leads to the downgrade.  With
the healthy return of Alexander at wide receiver, Green's stock could be on
the rise in the near future.  Green's value is at its lowest point, so you
could probably get him for relatively cheap.  He's not an every week
starter, but he might have a few big games left for this season.

QB - Donovan McNabb - McNabb has looked horrendous in the pocket over the
last two weeks (221 passing yards and 1 touchdown).  His pride of wanting to
be a quality pocket passer is getting in the way of his production.
McNabb's value will be dependent on his ability to scramble and make some
plays. Right now, McNabb should still be considered a top 10 fantasy
quarterback.  However, if his lack of production continues, his stock will
drop quickly.

QB - Brian Griese - Griese's receiving options are limited, which is
directly affecting his production.  Rod Smith limped through Thursday's game
with an ankle injury.  A healthy return of Smith will boost Griese's stock.
However, Griese needs some quality production from the other receiver
position.  His production is limited, if he is forced to throw to the tight
end position the majority of the time.

QB - Daunte Culpepper - Culpepper did not pass/score a touchdown for the
first time in his two seasons as the starting quarterback for the Vikings.
Another difficult challenge at Pittsburgh is upcoming this week.

RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held out of Sunday's game with a hamstring
injury.  He's expecting to play this weekend against Detroit, but this is
not a guarantee.  With James Allen being effective, it would not surprise me
to see the Bears hold Thomas out for another game to ensure a healthy
hamstring for the stretch run towards the playoffs.  A big game looms in two
weeks against Green Bay and the Bears will need a healthy Thomas in that
game.

RB - Emmitt Smith - Smith was held to 9 yards on 9 carries during the
Thanksgiving Day game.  Until the Cowboys can establish a passing game,
Smith's numbers will remain meager.

RB - Ron Dayne - With Tiki Barber establishing himself as the first option
in the rushing game, Dayne's fantasy value has dropped very low.  Dayne had
26 yards on 6 carries.  Barber had 124 rushing yards on 19 carries, 5
receptions for 41 yards and a touchdown.  Keep Dayne on your bench.

RB - Jason Brookins - Brookins broke his foot in Sunday's game against the
Jaguars.  He is expected to be out for 4-6 weeks.  Drop him and add someone
else to the roster.

RB - Eddie George - George's disappointing season continues with 58 yards on
15 carries this past Sunday.  George is currently tied with Randy Moss for
""Fantasy Disappointment of the Year"".

RB - Maurice Smith - Smith sprained his ankle on Sunday and managed to
return to the game.  However, Smith gained a meager 57 yards on 21 carries
and seemed to be bother by the ankle sprain.  Evaluate his progress later
this week.

WR - Jimmy Smith - Smith tested positive for cocaine in his system after
being pulled over by police.  No legal action will occur, but some sort of
suspension could be handed down by the commissioner's office.  Not a good
sign as we head closer to the fantasy playoffs.

WR - Peter Warrick - Warrick suffered a bruised shoulder against Cleveland
on Sunday. He was held to 1 reception for 22 yards and has not scored a
touchdown since week 4 of the season.  Keep him on your bench until the
Cincinnati passing game reappears.

WR - Randy Moss - Moss was held to 25 yards on 4 catches Sunday night.  Moss
is the most talented receiver in the league, but appears to lose
concentration from time to time.  Keep in mind, his potential for explosive
games is enormous.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Waiver Wire

Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14
team leagues.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van
Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to
match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against
weaker opponents.

RB - James Allen - Allen stepped in for the injured Anthony Thomas and
performed admirably.  With Thomas bothered by a hamstring injury, it's
highly possible that Allen could start against the lowly Detroit Lions this
weekend.  Chicago's defense is strong and the Bears like to grind it out on
the ground.

RB - Travis Minor - With Lamar Smith averaging just 2.3 yds/carry over the
last 6 games, Minor may be given his opportunity to shine very soon.  In his
limited touches, Minor has looked good and could give the Dolphins offense a
much needed spark.

WR - Chris Chambers - This guy is good.  See description in upgrades
section.

TE - Eddie ""Boo"" Williams - I had Williams on the list last week and his
play on Sunday deserves another mention.  Although he had just 2 catches for
44 yards, Williams has explosive potential.  He nearly scored on a 25 yard
pass play, but had the ball ripped out of his hands at the last second.
With Cam Cleeland remaining out with an injury, Williams is a tight end with
quality upside.

Once the commissioner enters the matchups, all owners can
view them on the Schedule, Playoffs page.


CONSOLATION MATCHUPS DURING PLAYOFF WEEKS

The fantasy playoffs are upon us. So why leave the
non-playoff teams on the sidelines? Commissioners can set
not only the playoff matchups, but consolation matchups as
well, under the Schedule, Matchups link in the Front
Office.


PLAYOFF INFORMATION

Go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoff
tournament starts and how many rounds it lasts. If you were
lucky "" make that skillful "" enough to make the playoffs,
go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams
with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Dixon was suspended for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh for missing a team 
meeting earlier in the week. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the 
season.   

 Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Greisen replaced an injured Dave Brown in the third quarter of Sunday's game 
at Jacksonville. The second-year quarterback completed 4-of-7 passes for 46 
yards and a touchdown in his short appearance in the game. With the 
Cardinals' season lost, Greisen could get some serious playing time in 
Arizona's last two games, but he is still not a viable Fantasy option at this 
point in the season.    

 Dave Brown , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown started for the injured Jake Plummer against the Jacksonville Jaguars 
on Sunday. He was ineffective for the most part, throwing for only 135 yards 
and an interception before leaving the game with a bruised right index 
finger. Whether it is Plummer, Brown or Chris Greisen under center for 
Arizona next week, it is imperative to avoid any Cardinals' quarterback at 
this point in the season.      

 Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Plummer, still suffering from bruised ribs, missed Sunday's game against the 
Jaguars. He was replaced in the starting lineup by Dave Brown. The Cardinals 
face off against the Ravens and their top-rated defense next week, so even if 
Plummer is healthy, he shouldn't be considered a starter for your Fantasy 
team.  

 Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Meximullets Updated 12/11/00 
 McNabb was brilliant in Sunday's blowout win over the Browns.  He threw for 
390 yards and four touchdowns, proving that he is not strictly a running 
quarterback. It was one of McNabb's best all-around performances, and it 
likely helped many Fantasy owners advance in their league's playoffs. 
Unfortunately for those same owners, McNabb and the Eagles have a late season 
bye next week, so you will need to look elsewhere for a quarterback in your 
quest for the Fantasy championship.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Seahawks' defense lost three players to injury in Sunday's loss to the 
Broncos. Safety Jay Bellamy (lower back cramps), defensive end Lamar King 
(shoulder) and defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy (thumb) all left the game with 
various injuries. At this point of the Fantasy season, you should avoid 
starting the Seahawks' defense at all costs.    

 Jets , DT NYJ - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jets' defense put up a good fight against the Raiders on Sunday night, 
but were hurt by turnovers which kept them on the field for a good portion of 
the game. The 31 points they gave up to Oakland was only one more than the 
total points they had allowed in the previous three weeks. Expect a better 
performance next week against the Lions - especially if the weather is cold 
at the Meadowlands. On the injury front, defensive lineman Rick Lyle broke 
his leg against the Raiders and will be lost for the season.     

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Aikman left Sunday's game against the Redskins with yet another concussion.  
He looked dazed on the sidelines and is reportedly still suffering from 
dizziness and other symptoms caused by concussions. With only two games 
remaining in the season, don't be surprised if Aikman has seen his last snap 
of the year - and maybe his career. Fantasy owners need to look elsewhere 
than Dallas to find a quarterback worthy of starting during their playoffs.   

 Ray Lucas , QB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Lucas replaced an injured Vinny Tesatverde (groin) in the third quarter of 
Sunday's game at Oakland. Chad Pennington also saw action at QB in the game's 
final quarter.  

 Torry Holt , WR STL - Meximullets Updated 12/10/00 
 On nine catches, Holt racked up 172 yards. With Kurt Warner returning to 
form, Holt should be able to maintain a high level of play during the final 
rounds of the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/10/00 
 Though he completed just 12 of 28 passes, Brooks passed for 203 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions, and also ran 11 times for 108 yards. 
Brooks has suddenly emerged as a surprising two-way threat just in time for 
the Fantasy playoffs.       

 Jacquez Green , WR TB - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/10/00 
 The Tampa Bay wideout failed to record a catch against Miami. After some 
early-season heroics, Green has proved he doesn't deserve to start on any 
Fantasy team during the postseason.      

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - The Snake Pit Updated 12/10/00 
 With the Jets trailing 21-0, Testaverde injured his groin and was replaced 
by Ray Lucas in the third quarter of Sunday night's game at Oakland. Lucas 
threw an interception on his first drive and was briefly replaced by Chad 
Pennington on the Jets' next possession before finishing the series.   

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 12/10/00 
 The Packers' quarterback completed just 15 of 36 passes for 208 yards with 
one touchdown, one interception and a lost fumble. If you advance to the next 
round, you may want to sit Favre, who has run hot and cold during Green Bay's 
recent resurgence.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - FDIC Updated 12/10/00 
 Topping 1,000 yards for the season, Allen ran for 97 yards and a touchdown 
on 37 carries. He also caught a TD pass. Allen played well against the lowly 
Patriots, but you still might not be able to consistently depend on him as a 
Fantasy starter during the postseason.    

 Darnell Autry , RB PHI - Meximullets Updated 12/10/00 
 Despite scoring the Eagles' initial touchdown, Autry ran for just 28 yards 
on 10 carries. Newly-signed Chris Warren did not play, but Autry certainly 
feels Warren's shadow looming over him and might see his playing time 
seriously slip in the final two games.  

 Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Mean Machine Updated 12/10/00 
 The rookie back picked up just 20 yards on 11 carries. Don't trust him 
during these important final weeks. Dayne has been much too inconsistent this 
season.  

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Ramiro Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 150 yards and a touchdown. Smith looked like he 
was in his prime, evading tacklers, pushing them over and exploding away from 
them. He still has the tools to be an integral part of a Fantasy title team.  

 Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Ramiro Updated 12/10/00 
 On 11 carries, Pittman ran for minus one yard. If Jake Plummer continues to 
battle injuries, opponents will tee off on Pittman. Thomas Jones also looked 
good in garbage time and very well could see more playing time in the final 
two games.  

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/10/00 
 On six catches, Dawkins finished with 85 yards and a pair of touchdowns. As 
expected, he took advantage of the awful Denver secondary but he is still not 
a reliable starter during the Fantasy playoffs.   

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/10/00 
 While running for 89 yards on 17 carries, Richardson added eight catches for 
56 yards. He should keep the starting halfback job in Kansas City for the 
season's final two games.   

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 Reaching the end zone on the ground and through the air, George ran 24 times 
for 81 yards and a touchdown, while catching four passes for 20 yards and two 
more scores. George will definitely be the MVP of many Fantasy championship 
teams this year.   

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Murder Inc. Updated 12/10/00 
 The Jaguars' wideout caught eight passes for 147 yards and a touchdown. He 
appears to be rasing his level of play just in time for the final rounds of 
the Fantasy playoffs.      

 Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Kaufman left Sunday's game against the Jets in the second quarter after 
injuring his right knee. He was taken to the locker room for further 
examnination.  

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 On seven catches, Patten racked up 103 yards and a touchdown. Patten has 
showed signs of promise this year, but has lacked consistency when 
healthy.      

 Shannon Sharpe , TE BAL - The Rounders Updated 12/10/00 
 The veteran tight end caught just one pass for seven yards. Trent Dilfer 
appears to be speading the ball among many WRs, and Sharpe has suddenly 
become a non-factor in the Baltimore offense.   

 Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - FDIC Updated 12/10/00 
 In a valiant effort, Bledsoe completed 26 of 45 passes for 225 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions. The veteran QB might continue to perform 
well in New England's final two games.   

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 79 yards and the Dolphins' lone touchdown. 
Despite facing the Tampa Bay run defense, Smith did not let his owners down 
at a crucial time of year.   

 Corey Dillon , RB CIN - The Rounders Updated 12/10/00 
 On 18 carries, Dillon picked up only 42 yards. The Cincinnati RB still has a 
tendency to disappear against the league's better defenses.  

 Ryan Wetnight , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Wetnight suffered a concussion in Sunday's win over Detroit.

132,"Dear St. Arnold's Army:

Ho! Ho! Ho!

This Friday, November 10 will be our 6th annual Christmas Ale Pub Crawl!  And 
for the survivors, you will be mugged.  That is, you will receive a free St. 
Arnold mug.  To qualify, all you have to do is make it to four of the stops.  
This is always a fun event, but we also have a list of suggestions for all 
participants for maximum enjoyment.  But first, where will it be?  Well, it 
cannot be preannounced to specific bars, but here is the general info: 

We will be in the Greater Rice Village Area.

We will begin at 6:00 pm.  We will gather immediately before the crawl at the 
parking lot on the south side of Bissonnet just east of Kirby, next to the 
Chevron Station.  The parking lot has a sign that says Wayland Properties (or 
something very close to that).  We will look for a bar near there to start.  
Hopefully the Bentley will be parked obviously everywhere we go.  

At 7:00, we will proceed eastward on Bissonnet.
At 8:00, we will proceed south on Morningside, turning right on Quemby.
At 9:00, we will proceed south on Kirby a block or so.
At 10:00, we will proceed further south down Kirby, then left on Rice.
At 11:00, we will proceed east on University, then take a right on 
Morningside.  For this finale, we'll do a couple of bars at once on 
Morningside.  

The Hotline numbers to try to hook up with us during the crawl are: 
713-202-4557 and 281-686-5090.  Use this if hopelessly lost.

Now, for the tips for maximum enjoyment:

1. PRECOATING: Try to eat something before commencing the crawl. 
2. PACING: Too many Christmas Ales at the first stop is a critical strategic 
mistake.  This is known as ""Sprinting Too Early"" which is not advisable in 
this, a distance event.  Can have negative repercussions later.
3. MANNERS: Be patient with bar staff.  Remember, 100 or so people just 
descended upon some poor, unsuspecting crew.  They will be working as fast as 
they can, but they won't have 10 people serving us as there will probably not 
be another mass of jubilant humanity arriving upon our departure.  This is 
also sometimes referred to as the ""Bum Rush"", but in our case, it is the 
""Saintly Rush"".
4. BUDDY SYSTEM: Make sure that you are always in contact with a couple of 
people you know.  One of you is bound to notice that the pack is starting to 
move on to the next stop.  This prevents the disoriented feeling of looking 
around an empty bar and realizing that the only three people still in there 
are guzzling some inferior malted beverage and may be related to the missing 
link.
5. MAKE NEW FRIENDS: As everyone on this crawl will be intelligent and good 
looking, this is an excellent place to meet new people.  Also, you will note 
that some people become better looking as the crawl wears on.  If this 
occurs, be sure to consult your Buddy System partner.
6. DESIGNATED DRIVER: Yes, we encourage this strongly.  You never know when 
you might decide to run for president.  And even the designated drivers on 
the crawl qualify for the mug.  While pregnant wives are perfect for this 
role, it is known to be poor judgment for a husband to claim that this is the 
best part of her being pregnant.  See ""Mood Swings.""
7. ENJOY ST. ARNOLD'S BEERS: It is in poor taste to be seen quaffing anything 
else.  Ever.  See ""Curse of Saint Arnold.""

We look forward to seeing y'all out there. Feel free to dress like Santa, St. 
Arnold or Rudolph.  Actually, not like Rudolph.  Deer season just opened.

Cheers,

Brock, David, Frank (both), James, Jamie, Jesse, Pete aka the Brew Crew!

PS:  Want to sell St. Arnold's or know someone that does?  Our distributor, 
Glazers, is hiring for a couple of positions in their beer department.  I'm 
not sure what they all are, but they are probably looking for a salesman, keg 
delivery driver and service tech/line cleaner.  Anyone who is interested 
should call Leroy Krischke at 713-578-1610 or Mike Allison at 713-795-4454.

meeting on Wednesday morning.  I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so 
it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.  

Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became 
concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other 
supporters of the program.   Many of those expressing frustration are heavily 
involved in the recruiting process.   It is their commitment to both 
recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting 
talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program. 

I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would 
bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss 
them with you in a constructive manner.  Our intent is continued support and 
improvement of the program.   The meeting took place on March 28 and included 
the following:

 Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU

 Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT  

 Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida

 Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of 
Florida

 Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU

 Carolyn Barrett  EBS    

 Howard Selzer  Enron Global E&P 


Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:

One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an 
announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.  Not much 
materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be 
managed.  In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw 
that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and 
differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.  We 
feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program 
on campus. 

SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is 
impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an 
innovative company.  The July start date does not consider December graduates 
and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in 
May.  

Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed 
senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or 
communication about the program.   We hear rumors of ""tracks"", but no facts 
or details.  Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some 
had not.  

Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support 
staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily 
focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.

Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many 
of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join 
with you in some of your plans for the program.   We are concerned that 
decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum 
without what could be some valuable input from some of us.  

MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team 
and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on 
campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top 
candidates and the pride of participants in the program.  We feel that the 
focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and 
we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.

Dynegy Seems To Have Options In Enron Deal
By Rebecca Smith and Robin Sidel
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

With the stock market telling Dynegy Inc. that energy trader Enron Corp. is=
n't worth even half what Dynegy has offered to pay, analysts and investors =
are paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could ba=
rgain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal.=20
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cros=
s-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values Enron shares at $10=
.85 apiece, or a total of about $9.2 billion. But in the wake of post-agree=
ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=
tially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.=
 trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=
ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=
r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.
Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under=
 the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=
ent with Enron contains a broad ""material adverse change"" clause as well as=
 some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20
Dynegy officials performed ""due diligence"" throughout the holiday weekend, =
seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=
red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that=
 some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved=
 assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=
ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an ""=
accounting error"" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=
ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=
s.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the=
 deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=
o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=
sions ""are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=
holders."" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=
t.=20
Clauses related to a ""material adverse change,"" also known as a ""material a=
dverse effect,"" have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=
onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the e=
conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=
tions.=20
But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=
onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=
t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =
groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =
envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20
Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=
hat a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=
sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=
t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IB=
P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=
ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the =
accounting issue.=20
In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=
. Strine Jr. wrote that "" . . . the important thing is whether the company =
has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=
ions that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercia=
lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=
her than months.""=20
That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=
ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=
ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=
dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=
ld qualify as a ""material adverse change,"" or MAC.=20
A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =
is ""whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is=
 it just a hiccup,"" says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=
uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =
a court ""may be skeptical"" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agree=
ment disclosures were a surprise.=20
The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=
er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=
antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=
ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million ""topper fee"" to Dyneg=
y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20
Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces ""pending or threatened"" litigation=
 liabilities that are ""reasonably likely"" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=
e liabilities hit $3.5 billion ""an Enron material event will be deemed to h=
ave occurred,"" presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=
ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20
Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that loss=
es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=
vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=
es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by=
 officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=
enses.=20
Deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=
ron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself =
give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=
s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's =
worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=
fficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's f=

The Corporation: Acquisitions
The Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy Trading
By Louise Lee in San Mateo, Calif.

It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=
r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=
e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=
man David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=
g for more oil and gas.=20
Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=
. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's =
planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is=
 making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =
business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy=
 and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=
ile ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=
s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's ear=
nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says a=
nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming=
 a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=
il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=
vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which=
 should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=
wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have=
 margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and oth=
er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20
Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=
e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=
ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =
sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=
s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.=
=20
Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=
nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Re=
illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=
ural-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.

ALL EYES ON THE ENRON PRIZE If the deal holds, Dynegy will walk away with s=

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

As Houston-based Enron Corp. imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its fina=
nces, few would have blamed Dynegy Inc. CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat=
 back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=
sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garn=
ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20
Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=
EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =
didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and th=
e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=
wer could be: Bail us out.
So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =
Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=
ffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =
p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=
nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=
llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=
o the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up=
 Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=
gy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20
Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=
00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =
that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=
I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's be=
en incredible to watch.''=20
Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=
t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=
00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =
of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control=
 an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=
.=20
That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading=
 operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company=
 to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=
rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=
ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=
ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=
er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=
000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It woul=
d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=
h Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commerc=
ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=
h as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, =
says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=
t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=
ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=
ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=
e the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=
ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities e=
xceed $3.5 billion.=20
Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not=
 a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operati=
on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=
ooked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it =
was.''=20
But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting=
 tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=
icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=
997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=
nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is=
 still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =
weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=
ecessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities=
 Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everyth=
ing of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive ear=
nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=
rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =
Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=
s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are m=
ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to iss=
ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=
hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=
ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=
ement job with the new company.=20
Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=
g and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclip=
sed Enron's 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay's execs got more credit.=
 ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been =
at the forefront of this business,'' says Bruce M. Withers, who sold his Tr=

-he's a 15% owner of the new Houston Texans pro football team. But with his=
 bold takeover of Enron, Watson has ensured that he's off the sidelines for=

CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? You're not alone. Here's what companies should do-=
-and what investors need to know
By Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20
With Mike McNamee in Washington

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard=
 to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=
ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=
, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=
hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It=
 was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had=
 announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hide=
ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=
nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=
clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a=
 billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's=
 net worth.=20
Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=
rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=
ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=
ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory=
 that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =
companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=
ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.
Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=
e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than =
the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=
n the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company ac=
tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=
s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=
he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =
to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=
s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stoc=
k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=
uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=
ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' s=
ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =
the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20
Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =
decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =
results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=
ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=
d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=
y of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such vers=
ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcemen=
t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=
t income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =
answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20
Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=
ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are=
 woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=
mpany's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,=
 and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone wh=
o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=
counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =
noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =
those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=
nce of ongoing operations.=20
That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calc=
ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=
mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=
ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says=
 Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =
is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =
perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20
What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=
d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=
vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=
t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=
r. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =
early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=
llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=
tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=
d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=
rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20
``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=
as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of=
 hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=
gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to=
 evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=
e better all know what we're looking at.''=20
Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=
erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street=
 is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=
rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10=
.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First=
 Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=
he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=
panies.)=20
The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use=
 First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =
modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=
g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20
How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating=
 operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =
or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=
reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=
ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conv=
entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=
ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=
llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma fo=
rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter=
 within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =
the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=
P's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pr=
o forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=
rs are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=
he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired=
 KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''=
=20
That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter end=
ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=
arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=
mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=
le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' in=
cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=
r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=
,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=
les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20
Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=
ng out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=
asure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal =
is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=
ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=
ing earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =
and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, a=
s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and=
 investors are free to ignore everything else.=20
There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =
asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=
ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=
.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =
SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=
sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =
and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=
to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=
ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=
d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net=
 income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=
ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =
five years added up to only $5 billion.=20
Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=
off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of=
 hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=
arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=
scribe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=
. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Anal=
ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=
s going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers=
 analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic-=
-a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investo=
rs to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =
eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=
ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs=
 of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=
erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=
f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=
nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of=
 an asset.=20
When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=
nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group=
 included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=
AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=
ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=
s.=20
The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=
inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =
Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=
rs shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =
to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In=
 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=
ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =
In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=
r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =
still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=
other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new ru=
les.=20
The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =
changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=
ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=
es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=
mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So=
 GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=
y's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=
s out in their unaudited press releases.=20
Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=
g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=
ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=
re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a gro=
wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide=
 missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=
ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =
investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=
ay's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.=20
The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=
ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=
stort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall in=
to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=
ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=
chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=
tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=
rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=
se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=
ir pro forma calculations.=20
Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =
of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo=
ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=
hareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the =
Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f=
ar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =
was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =
Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=
olders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=
an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=
ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=
ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =
tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains=
 in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in=
 its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=
e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer=
 maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =
spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b=
reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In=
 our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t=
here for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special=
 charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=
stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =
the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=
12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,=
 and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=
tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are=
 another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to=
 customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=
ked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating=
 its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking=
 sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame=
 the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=
n't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=
s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=
hed into write-offs.=20
Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=
xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnin=
gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or c=
harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=
t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=
n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=
ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =
that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite=
 a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they=
 can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' s=
ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20
Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=
m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=
sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =
of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =
with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20
Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =
example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=
mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=
ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =
Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=
e events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, =
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =
in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=
ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors a=
re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy=
 doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=
anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=
flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=
e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=
s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value=
 falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=
ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=
o take more charges.=20
But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=
here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=
aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =
``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=
ing up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Profe=
ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''=20
While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=
es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=
ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =
investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=
funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to=
 plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB=
 Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FF=
O is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than=
 another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''=20
There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=
store GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=
ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income=
 from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens s=
ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they=
 bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their=
 press releases with the SEC.=20
At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =
numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=
bers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment=
 of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=
n is more important to investors.

High-Gloss Glossary
Companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =
on
their results. Here's what those terms mean:
DEFINING EARNINGS:
NET INCOME
The bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=
P).
Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securitie=
s &
Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.
OPERATING EARNINGS
An adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=
ted
to the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure
called ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it=
 is
not an audited figure.
CORE EARNINGS
Another term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=
e
calculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the
preparer wishes.
PRO FORMA EARNINGS
The 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime=
s
excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The
granddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that
carried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely
quoted.
ADJUSTED EARNINGS
A new term for pro forma.
DEFINING COSTS:
SPECIAL CHARGES
A general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and
therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.
ASSET IMPAIRMENTS
Charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to it=
s
current market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on intern=
al
venture-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks at
inflated prices.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS
The same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the
premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible asset=
s
acquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because o=
f a
change in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill
amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair value=
s.
RESTRUCTURING RESERVES
An accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down=
 a
portion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs an=
d
if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.
WRITE-DOWN
Lowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is
often excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cos=
t
long ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cash
costs, such as investment-banking fees.

What did the company earn? That's the most basic question an investor can e=
ver ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=
s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=
orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=
ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =
New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=
ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=
ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=
g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=
rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =
clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=
rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the=
 global marketplace (page 76).=20
The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=
sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=
odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=
s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=
t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=
od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=
rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.
A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GA=
AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=
me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=
perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there=
 are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=
ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5=
00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=
tandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=
P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =
It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =
and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agenc=
y Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=
) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=
rnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=
s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=
r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,=
 and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=
uild on. The accounting anarchy has to end.

Back in Enron's heyday, one of its rising stars was Rebecca Mark. Nicknamed=
 ``Mark the Shark'' because of her ferocious ambition, she made her name in=
 the early '90s building the energy giant's international operations, inclu=

 two years of heading Enron's ailing water company spin-off, Azurix.=20
These days, as Enron struggles to stay afloat, Mark-Jusbasche (who hyphenat=
ed her name with that of her husband of two years) is watching the action f=
rom the sidelines. And she'd like to keep it that way. ``I'm very surprised=
 and saddened by [what has happened at Enron], and I wish them all the best=
,'' she says. Beyond that, Mark-Jusbasche, 47, is not much interested in ta=
lking about Enron, which is being acquired by a small rival after a spectac=
ular Wall Street flameout. Mark left Enron with millions of dollars worth o=
f Enron shares, although she says she has sold them since.
Mark-Jusbasche spends most of her time serving on advisory boards, both at =
Yale and Harvard business schools, as well as the school where her 16-year-=

In her spare time, she seeks out opportunities for investing. Currently, Ma=

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron still optimistic of averting fina=
ncial meltdown.
By ANDREW HILL and SHEILA MCNULTY.

11/26/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron said yesterday it was still expecting outside investors to inject $50=
0m to $1bn into the group, as talks continued to avoid a financial meltdown=
 at the energy trading group.=20
Dynegy, whose rescue bid for its Houston rival is crucial to Enron's surviv=
al, spent last week's Thanksgiving holiday and the weekend reviewing Enron'=
s operations and finances.
Dynegy said it remained ""optimistic for the potential of the merger to be c=
ompleted, and in the time-frame we originally announced - six to nine month=
s"".=20
Enron's fate depends on a delicate, unofficial pact between its lenders, Dy=
negy, and credit ratings agencies, which have resisted downgrading the grou=
p's debt while the deal is pending.=20
If the pact stays in place, at least $500m is likely to be invested in Enro=
n by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, Enron's key lenders and advisers. A fur=
ther $500m is being sought from private equity firms.=20
But if Dynegy pulls out of the deal, the cash infusion could be put in jeop=
ardy and the ratings agencies could downgrade the debt to junk, triggering =
debt repayments across a network of partnerships and off-balance-sheet vehi=
cles linked to Enron.=20
Enron confirmed yesterday that it was still seeking additional liquidity fr=
om new equity investors, but would not discuss their identities.=20
Enron's crisis of confidence became more acute last week when the shares fe=
ll from $9 to $4.74 following a regulatory filing that revealed the extent =
of the group's debt burden.=20
Completion of a $1bn secured credit line from JPM Chase and Citigroup, and =
the postponement of a $690m notes repayment due tomorrow were not sufficien=
t to prop up the share price. The bonds also fell to levels consistent with=
 a potential bankruptcy filing.=20
The slide in the share price has encouraged speculation that Dynegy is prep=
aring to renegotiate its all-stock bid, now worth $9.3bn, compared with Enr=
on's market value of $3.5bn.=20
But people close to Enron say renegotiation of the deal would not in itself=

Schwab Chief's Main Theme: Diversification
By Lynnette Khalfani
Dow Jones Newswires

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- More than two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many=
 investors remain edgy. But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has=
 shown remarkable resilience.=20
Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert=
s say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep =
their wits about them.
In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o=
f Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera=
ge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista=
kes they should avoid.=20
Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20
In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi=
nk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's per=
ceptions about risk have changed?=20
I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=
e risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing =
in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=
tions]. There's risk in real estate, too.=20
So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=
r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=
arned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock a=
n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20
What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? T=
hat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh=
anistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in =
the markets?=20
I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W=
e were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin=
g is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this co=
untry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th=
e strength of our government.=20
There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've h=
ad many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about a=
ll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret=
ty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't ge=
t better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully=
 before the economy goes up.=20
There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resourc=
e and buying power that's definitely available for new investments.=20
What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past =
two or so months?=20
They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn=
't use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After =
Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20
Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going=
 to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o=
f fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: ""Thi=
s is still the time to invest.""=20
My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, ""I just don=
't want to be in the stock market at all."" And it's just the time that peop=
le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20
Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post=
er child of the last cycle. Or people say, ""I'll get back in [the market] w=
hen I see the economy turn around."" Well, by the time they see that, it's t=
oo late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.

Enron Pursuing a Cash Infusion Energy: Company is seeking as much as $1bill=
ion as it tries to shore up its endangered acquisition by Dynegy.
From Bloomberg News

Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. said talks are continuing with potential investors f=
or an infusion of as much as $1 billion as the biggest energy trader tries =
to avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by Dynegy Inc.=20
An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened finances may prompt =
Dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction, which is=
 valued at $23 billion in stock and assumed debt.
Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in cash but would=
n't divulge details. ""We are not going to discuss the particulars of who we=
 are talking to,"" Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Sunday.=20
Shares of the Houston company fell by 48% in the last three trading session=
s on the New York Stock Exchange. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the s=
tock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to pay in th=
e acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will g=
o through as planned.=20
Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., Blacksto=
ne Group and Carlyle Group for a private equity investment, said industry a=
nalyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.=20
The firms have declined to comment.=20
In a conference call Nov. 14, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon=
 said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to=
 receive $500 million to $1 billion from those sources.=20
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690-millio=
n note due this week, gaining more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy=
 Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was ""encouraged"" by the commitment to=
 extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $450-million credit fa=
cility. He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.=20
Enron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from ChevronTexaco Inc.=
 as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In return, Dynegy received preferr=
ed stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural G=
as Co. pipeline. Under the deal's terms, if Dynegy and Enron fail to merge,=
 Dynegy can acquire the pipeline company.=20
But Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy's right to the pipeline =
might be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc=
., which accepted the asset as collateral for $1billion in loans to Enron.=
=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's attempts to secu=
re financing or whether more cash for Enron is a condition of keeping the m=
erger alive.=20
Enron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investi=
gation of the company, which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratin=
gs cut.=20
The company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week ago that it has=
 less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left.

Dynegy Optimistic That Enron Merger Will Succeed - FT

11/26/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) remains optimistic, after further re=
view of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) finances last week, that it will be able to buy=
 the company, the Financial Times reported Monday.=20
Dynegy said that it, ""remained optimistic for the potential of the merger t=
o be completed, and in the time frame we originally announced - six to nine=
 months,"" the FT reported.
Critical investment in Enron by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup will procee=
d only if an unofficial pact between Enron, Dynegy, and Enron's lenders and=
 credit rating agencies remains intact, the report said. Investment from th=
ese two is likely to total between $500 million and $1 billion, while Enron=
 continues to look for a further $500 million from private equity firms.=20
The deal suffered a setback last week, when a regulatory filing revealed a =
greater debt burden than some investors had realized. Enron's share price f=
ell following the report, to $4.74 from $9.00.=20
A $1 billion secured credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase and an extension of=
 a $690 million repayment due Tuesday weren't enough to keep the share pric=
e from falling. This led to speculation that Dynegy was considering renegot=
iating its all-stock bid, now at $9.3 billion, compared with Enron's market=
 value of $3.5 billion, said the report.=20
Renegotiating the deal wouldn't have any impact on Enron's finances, unname=
d sources told the FT.=20
But if Dynegy pulled out of the deal altogether, there might be no cash inf=
usion from J.P. Morgan chase and Citigroup. Credit ratings agencies could t=

His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it 
would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on 
July 1.  Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth 
transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen 
would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance 
review being based on his work for ENA.  Stephen is very talented and will no 
doubt do a great job at EBS.  During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his 
heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct 
reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our 
other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.  It was his 
failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs 
Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.   It is the r
elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that 
category.

Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.

288,"Dear Larry:
 We are currently completing the improved modeling to include the
effect of flow regimes, which I am sure that you recall that in our meeting
the last time, we agreed that this will be a major influence on both the
quantity of solvent and time required to clean it up. It is probably the
most important modification to the model. It has been a major efforts. We
hope to complete this part by June 20th. Then we will perform the rigorous
model testing.  With the continuous testing we have done on every module
independently, I do not expect us to run into any major difficulty, hence I
expect that to be done in one week to 10 days. We will then begin to conduct
parametric runs for the TW system. We will analyze the results and come up
with a summary of what it means and how that will affect economics, etc. So,
with all these, I will be able to prepare a comprehensive progress report by
July 15th. I hope that this schedule meets your approval.
 The flow regime & time-of-contact work is something that we did not
anticipate originally but which came up in the course of the review that
you, John and Tiny had with us at Penn State. I believe that it is really
important as some of the initial results are showing. So, I am grateful for
your input. It has taken a little more time (perhaps more than little) to do
it but we are very very close to completing this part. I believe that it
would be worth the effort.
 I have been told by the Office of Research that our current contract
expires at the end of the month unless you sign the ""no-cost"" extension.
This document should have reached your desk according to them. I am not sure
that you'd recall; we have been able to conserve funds on the project
because I have 2 of the students (they are from Venezuela) working on the
project being sponsored by their own Govt. and hence we have not paid them
from the project. I would appreciate your prompt approval of the no-cost
extension of the contract so that the University would not stop us from
continuing. When I submit my comprehensive progress report in mid-July, I
suggest that we meet thereafter to discuss the results and direction and at
that point, it would be necessary to discuss the finance as well.
 I appreciate the support that I have received from all of you. I
look forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,
Michael

290,"Byron/Tiny, I spoke to Ken Jacobs with the Forest Service and have attached 
his e mail below concerning the Forest Sevice's choice for the building.  I 
have informed him that our new piping and ancillary equipment will remain 
white which is consistent with the existing equipment.  He had no problems 
with this.  I also had asked him if there was a name for the brown which the 
FS uses on their signs and he did not know of a specific name, so I think the 
best thing would be to match as closely as possible.


The Forest Service would like the new Compressor Building to be painted
dark brown.  The color should be close to the color that we use for our
signs.  Call me at 520-214-2464 if you would like to discuss this.

liquids collection SoCal wants to take at our Needles facility.  Ralph said 
that SoCal will be undertaking a study on their pipeline to determine why the 
concentration and liquids volume of PCB's has reduced into their system in 
the past couple of  years (97-2000). I shared with Ralph and up until this 
year, we have not had liquids at the Needles facility since 1994.  He stated 
that they have seen reduced concentrations and are curious as to why this 
trend is occurring (sounds like good news to me).  He said that their data 
shows the following:

 1998 liquids concentrations  only 1% regulated at the federal level

 1999 liquids concentrations only 8% regulated at the federal level

Ralph has requested that SoCal be allowed to collect a  liquids sample at the

the collection.

involved early whenever there are transactions involving personnel issues.  
You haven't involved me in this deal -- I learned about the fact that there 
are employees and unions from my clients in HR.  That makes me and the legal

Based upon your memo and our due diligence effort to date, is there any 
indication of (a) any steps Daishowa has taken to put the committee required 
under the Pay Equity Act or (b) any increase in compensation that would be 
consistent with the Pay Equity Act and therefore enable Daishowa to dispense 
with the need for a committee?  Is there any way to currently assess what 
potential liabilities could be or to view any industry data on this issue 
that may indicate how extensive liability could be???

The main concern is that we are negotiating with Daishowa to be in a position 
to undertake, as of closing, all responsibilities associated with all matters 
disclosed, unless there is a legal noncompliance issue (e.g., failure to 
maintain proper permits).  Since the requirements of the Pay Equity Act have 
not been identified to management as a concern, I need to ensure that this is 
a real issue (mostly from a $'s exposure standpoint) vs. something so remote 
that it should not even be discussed.

Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

BRUSSELS, July 26, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Financial and logistical problems as well as unattractive prices have diminished Europe's attractiveness as a market for Indonesian hardwood pulp suppliers, who were blamed for the dramatic fall in hardwood pulp prices. 
On top of that, reported action in Italy by an environmental group against a paper producer said to be buying Indonesian pulp is another factor that may have stemmed the flow of Indonesian hardwood to the region. 
While the action was said to be ""nothing new"" by one importer of Indonesian pulp, he conceded that buyers were asking more questions about the timber source for these products in the wake of the campaign. Another supplier added, ""This means that certain customers will not use Indonesian pulps anymore.""
Separately, the environmental group Friends of the Earth has mounted a high profile campaign in the UK against the use of non-plantation hardwood in papermaking.
Prices near bottom
Market pulp prices remain hard to pin down. As one buyer put it, ""All the numbers are low and all the numbers are fluid."" Eucalyptus pricing is particularly elusive as more deals which are a mixture of regular and spot business emerge. As gross prices for regular business net down to something very similar to spot offers, there is a genuine reason to believe that the bottom has been reached for this grade.
Northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) prices slipped gently between FOEX's July 17 figure of $478.91/tonne and $477.27/tonne on July 24, although most buyers agree, and sellers concede, that new deals for regular business are likely to be done at $460/tonne. Spot prices for NBSK are even lower at a price below which many North American producers fail to break even. Downtime was insufficient to prevent these break-even levels from being reached. There is little room for spot prices to fall further.
More downtime can be expected in the Norscan countries as a result of such weak prices. Norske Skog Canada has announced a further 14,000 tonnes of market pulp downtime, which brings the company's third quarter market pulp curtailment up to 28,000 tonnes.
If inventories remain static for the next two months, during a period when they traditionally rise, and then fall during the fourth quarter, this would set the scene for prices to creep up again in the first quarter next year or even before. A strong dollar and poor worldwide economic performance will hamper any rapid change in the pulp market's fortunes though.
Evidence that the market is approaching a period of price stability is mounting. One supplier reported, ""We have already had some requests from customers to price pulp for July and August, which is an indication that they think we have reached the bottom.""
Pulp consumption in June dropped by more than 5 percent compared to May, according to UTIPULP figures. The participating countries reported consumption of 1,044,359 tonnes in June, which left stocks virtually unchanged at 1,046,052 tonnes. This equates to some 28 days' worth of pulp.

SAN FRANCISCO, July 17, 2001 (Forestweb) - International Paper Co. (IP) took 80,000 tonnes of market pulp downtime in the second quarter and is likely to take the same amount in both the third and fourth quarters, the company said today. 
IP executive vice president and chief financial officer John Faraci made the comments in the company's conference call today, in connection with the release of second quarter results showing a $313 million net loss. 
An IP spokesman said there were no further details. 
The second-half plan would be about the same rate of market downtime the company has taken since the beginning of the year. 
Last month an informed source said that from January through April, the company had taken 130,000 tonnes of total pulp downtime, including 25,000 tonnes for maintenance. 
That would average 26,250 tonnes per month of market-related downtime for the first four months of the year, about the same as the 26,700 tonnes per month average for 80,000 tonnes per quarter.

	REEL TIME SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT
November 14, 2001 

  <http://www.reeltimenewsletter.com/images/hori525.jpg>

	
	Retail Review:  October Retail Sales Up 7.1% To A New 8 -Year Low

The strength of retail sales impacts advertising expenditures and thus paper consumption. This supplemental report will review several items related to retail sales and advertising spending so the title is only partially descriptive - but I couldn't pass up the opportunity

The title story first. The October increase in national retail sales of 7.1% over September should be accompanied by a chorus of ""Happy Days are Here Again"" - but let's take a closer look. Auto sales were up 26.4% in October due to a 0% interest promotional program, which was obviously a great success, but is unrepeatable. Excluding auto sales, national retail sales were up only 1% over depressed September sales.

When comparing October of 2001 to October of 2000, retail sales, excluding autos, were up only 1.6%, which according to The Dismal Scientist, is the slowest year-over-year growth in at least 8 years. Furniture, home furnishings, and electronic retailers all had lower sales than in October 2000, while apparel sales were flat. Early anecdotal reports in November seem to point to modest improvement over October. There will be a Christmas season but it won't be robust and it's too early to break out into song.

Ad Pages and Survivorship Bias

The Magazine Publishers Association reported that year-to-date ad pages through August were down 11.2%. However, September ad pages were down 9.9% and that brought the year-to-date decline to 9.2%! How can ad pages be reduced from a negative 11.2% year-to-date to a negative 9.2% year-to-date by the inclusion of a one-month decline of 9.9%? It's not easy.

""Survivorship Bias"" can be the manipulation of a reality TV show or, in this case, provide the answer to our ad page dilemma. MPA ad pages are calculated each month by comparing the year-over-year change of a specific list of magazines. New magazines are only added at the beginning of each year. However, when magazines cease publication during the year, both last year's ad pages and this year's ad pages are eliminated. Since magazines which cease publication during the year will almost always have ad page declines greater than average before closure (and a 100% decline after closure), the elimination of these magazines from the survey creates a positive bias - a survivorship bias. Only surviving magazines are considered.

It was the closure of The Industry Standard in August that was largely responsible for the ad page anomaly between the August and September year-to-date data. Ad pages in The Industry Standard were down 76% through August, but since there was no September publication, this magazine was no longer included in the survey and this huge drop in ad pages was no longer represented in the data.

This year has been an especially difficult year for magazine publishers. Through August, more than 60 titles were eliminated, and many were not new publications. Nineteen had been in business prior to 1990 and five had start-ups between 1928 and 1959. Mademoiselle ends a 66-year run in November.

Since all these closures will be purged from ad page data, the real ad page decline is significantly greater than that being reported.

October Ad Pages

Monthly reports of year-over-year ad page declines had bottomed in May and, while still negative, had improved for three consecutive months. Absent the events of September 11, October ad pages would have likely declined between 4 and 8%. October was, however, the first month of ad pages to be impacted by September 11 and was down 16.8% from October 2000.

Catalog Sales

Catalog Age tracks 17 publicly traded consumer catalogers and indicated that 8 out of 17 of these companies had reported a net loss in the second quarter.

September 11 events, the anthrax situation, and another postage increase sometime in the next 9 months are exacerbating what was already a very difficult economic environment for catalogs.

When Will The Economy Bottom?

Most economists are expecting a short, mild recession, which will bottom in Q1/02. We won't argue the point very hard but still expect the bottom a little later, hopefully by Q2/02. Since retail is about 2/3's of our economy, any turnaround will have to be accompanied by an improvement in retail sales. Until this turnaround takes place, print advertising and print consumption will remain under pressure.

This credits the proposed Enron Grandfathering plan to have the remainder of 
the time to Oct. 15, 2001 in which to achieve full activation of the written

While there are substantial numbers of law suits filed over this final rule, 
the outlook for any satisfactory court action is unlikely, as is action from

There have been a number of questions concerning the Ray Bowen's memo of February 11th regarding approvals for purchases (iPayit) and payments (iBuyit) and approvals for Employee Expense reports.  ETS is trying to change the procedures which were put in place so what I state today could be different tomorrow.

As of February 20, 2002 the following procedures are to be followed for the Gas Logistics community:

	All iBuyit items must be approved by Rod Hayslett.  The iBuyit system has been or is in the process of being changed so that Rod has the final approval before orders are placed.  I believe our ETS buyers are ensuring that all requests are approved by Rod.  To help Rod out it would be in your best interest to state a business need for the requested purchase as well as company, cost center and under which category in the budget the item was budgeted for (Approved Project Number; Blanket number; expense GL acct (52504500 - pc equipment), etc.  Rod should be the last in the chain for approvals. IT should proceed with its normal chain of approval (supervisor, Director, VP etc.) prior to being sent to Rod for his final approval.

	All iPayit items must be coded and sent to Rod Hayslett for final approval.  As in the iBuyit system, Rod should be the last in the chain for approvals.  All internal approvals and checking for correct coding should be completed prior to being sent to Rod for his final approval.

	All IT Employee Expense reports must be coded and sent to Shelley Corman for final approval.  All internal approvals and checking for correct coding should be completed prior to being sent to Shelley for her final approval.

	Other Items:
?	All invoices should be processed in iPayit and should be sent to accounts payable far enough in advance so that they may be processed in the system.
?	For invoices that must be paid in 2-7 days, sign-off from the following is required - Shelley Corman, Rod Hayslett, and a Cash Management Committee member (see me and I will help walk you through the rest once sign off is received from Shelley and Rod).  Urgent Payment Request form filled out.
?	For same day payment, sign off from the following is required - Shelley Corman, Rod Hayslett, and George Wasaff.  The cut off time for sending current day payments to the AP processing team is 12:00 noon and for next day payments 3:00pm.  Again see me after signatures and I will walk you through the process. Urgent Payment request Form filled out.
?	Urgent Payment Request Forms are located on the ISC Website and the iBuyit website.  These forms are used for all exception payments i.e. payments outside of iPayit.

I hope this helps.   cvb

378,"Dear NAESB Board Members:

During the FERC meeting on December 19, the Commissioners addressed the 
creation of a standards organization within the context of its standardized 
market design effort and issued an order providing guidance on the formation 
of a standards development organization for the wholesale electric industry.  

FERC noted in the order that they expect a single, industry wide organization 
by March 15.  If the industry fails to reach a consensus on its own, the 
Commission will either choose or set up one itself; or institute proceedings 
to accomplish that.

There was specific reference to the confidence that the FERC has in GISB and 
its process -- including voting and the relationship with the FERC when 
policy disputes arise.  Further noted was the recommendation that the 
wholesale electric standards setters should ensure similar consensus building 
processes.  Coordination with reliability, retail electric and natural gas 
standards setting and wholesale natural gas standards setting activities is a 
necessity.

The order providing guidance is attached.

Best Regards,  Rae

Understanding there are many nuances and directions for discussing a contract 
restructuring with the QFs, I am attaching a general outline of a potential 
structure we (Chris Foster and I)  would like to pitch to Wheelabrator.  
Could you look this over and provide your initial comments.  I have thought 
of providing more specific terms in regards to sharing % and potential up 
front payments for the optionality but would like you input.  For example, we 
could apply an option value to the deal.  In Wheelabrator's case, the 
intrinsic reverse toll (ie our ability to provide market based power to the 
IOU using SRAC at 9210 HeatRate) is in the range of $4-5 MM for the Malin gas 
pricing and $9-11 MM if we assume the combined Socal/Malin curve.  If we 
lower the contract heat rate to 8500 the intrinsic value drops about $2 MM.  
The other alternative, which may be the easiest to sell,  is to just agree 
with the IOU/PUC on a lower heat rate and the Malin curve.  

Another value upside, and probably the highest value in the short run, is to 
be able to optimize the QF contract deliverability obligations. (ie.  in a 
very simplified case, if the obligation is only 80 percent, then deliver 80 
%). 

I will give you a call or call me when you have a free moment.

418,"******************
SVMG Energy Committee members,

GE-San Jose recently took delivery of four mobile generators
(provided by GE Rental Energy.) These units will be used to provide partial
power for our operations during rotating block outages affecting GE's site.
Each generator is 800 KWs in size and uses diesel fuel. The fuel tank is an
integral part of the generator, located underneath the engine itself. These
mobile generators were permitted for air emissions under a statewide program
and are referred to generically, for that reason, as Statewide Registered
Portable Generators.

The San Jose fire department, which must grant a permit in order for
these generators to operate, inspected the units last week and then refused
to grant the approval. The reason given was that the fuel tanks constitute
storage tanks containing a hazardous material (Class III-A combustible
liquid) and therefore should meet special requirements for permanent tanks,
including the possibility that the tanks be stored underground. Our own
reading of the California fire code does not lead to this conclusion and
seems to be, in fact, silent on the issue.

Furthermore, we think rented portable generators permitted to
operate in the Statewide Mobile Equipment Program should not require local
fire permits.  In any case, we believe the mobile generators are presently
installed and widely used across the San Jose Fire Department jurisdiction,
if not the whole State and that most companies haven't identified their use
to the City.

Given the perilous state of electricity supplies, we would obviously
like to get past this and start using the generators.

So....a heads up....if your facility is storing diesel fuel in
""non-permanent"" tanks, you may be subject to a cease and desist order down
the road.

My question for the group is...does anyone have any experience in
this matter and can, therefore, offer some insight or advice?  I would be
particularly interested to know if you are using any portable emergency
generators in your San Joes operations.

Regards,

John Redding",John Redding,,"SVMG Energy Committee GE-San Jose GE Rental Energy GE Statewide Registered

AES Expresses Interest in Enron's India Project

BOMBAY, India -- Power giant AES Corp. said it ""would consider getting 
involved"" with rival Enron Corp.'s $3 billion Dabhol Power Co. project in 
India, but Dabhol's backers so far don't see AES as a serious contender to 
buy out the troubled electricity venture. 
The 740-megawatt Dabhol project hasn't produced power for more than a month, 
because of a payment and tariff dispute between the company and its sole 
customer, the western industrial state of Maharashtra. Enron officials have 
said it's unlikely any buyer would step in now, with Maharashtra insisting on 
renegotiation of the project's 1,444-megawatt second phase and contractors 
delaying its completion because of unpaid bills.
""We don't see that opportunity now,"" agreed Surender Singh, AES's executive 
director in India. ""They have to get [the dispute] resolved first."" But he 
added, ""We are not denying we have an interest."" 
In a statement issued in India yesterday, AES said it has made ""no formal 
proposal to any stakeholders at this stage,"" but Mr. Singh wouldn't comment 
on reports that the company had talked with one of Dabhol's lenders. He also 
said AES wouldn't consider buying into the project unless it gained 
management control. 
Houston-based Enron has been trying without luck to sell a 15% stake in 
Dabhol. Enron holds 65%, and the rest is split among General Electric Co., 
Bechtel Corp. and the cash-strapped government of Maharashtra. Enron is 
believed to be looking for a way to leave the Dabhol project entirely. 
The politically charged rate dispute appears increasingly to be heading for a 
lengthy legal mediation, since Maharashtra is asking for much steeper tariff 
reductions than Enron is willing to give. Also, Enron may wish to avoid 
negotiating a new power-purchase agreement, which would allow a recently 
formed state regulatory commission to claim jurisdiction over the project's 
rates. The commission has already won the first round of a court battle 
trying to assert its authority, though Dabhol is expected to appeal. 
AES, Arlington, Va., is known for its willingness to take on political risks. 
Still, some Dabhol officials worry that AES's vague expression of interest 
will further muddy Enron's situation in India. The first of several local 
newspaper articles quoting AES officials as wanting to take over Dabhol 
appeared on June 16, just as Dabhol and its lenders were winding up a crucial 
bargaining session with Maharashtra.

California Energy Firm Subsidiary Puts Rockville, Md., Headquarters on Hold

D.C.

Reporter (TM)

The California energy crunch has forced a PG&E Corp. subsidiary to delay its 
plan for a new $100 million headquarters in Rockville. 
PG&E National Energy Group was expected to start construction this summer on 
the 450,000-square-foot complex in Tower Oaks, a business campus off 
Interstate 270.
The plans are now on hold because of financial problems within the parent 
company that are rooted in the California power crunch, a spokesman said. 
Another PG&E unit, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., filed for protection from 
its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in April. It 
listed an $8.9 billion deficit. 
That unit, which has 13 million customers in California, suffered when the 
state changed its electricity regulations and the company was forced to buy 
increasingly expensive wholesale power without the ability to pass the rising 
costs to its customers. 
""Even though our companies are completely separate, we believe it is prudent 
to put the project on hold and focus on other parts of the business,"" said 
David Mould, spokesman for National Energy Group. 
The company develops and operates electric and gas power plants, and operates 
one of the nation's largest energy-trading businesses. 
It announced a new $550 million line of credit from several investment banks 
last week and said in a statement it would use the money for working capital 
and to ""establish a credit identity that is independent of PG&E Corp."" 
National Energy Group currently occupies 320,000 square feet in Bethesda. It 
has about 650 employees. 
This summer, the company expected to begin construction in Tower Oaks on a 
10-story office building with roughly 280,000 square feet and an adjacent 
building with about 140,000 square feet. 
Mr. Mould said he did not know when construction might begin, but that the 
company is ""still committed"" to the project. 
A spokesman for the Tower Cos., the north Bethesda group that is developing 
Tower Oaks, declined to comment yesterday. 
National Energy Group's decision to delay the project is ""disappointing,"" 
said Stephen Christian, business development specialist for the Montgomery 
County Department of Economic Development. 
But the department, which helped National Energy Group plan the new 
headquarters, believes the company will eventually get the project ""back on 
track,"" Mr. Christian said. 
A spokesman for the Electric Power Supply Association said power companies 
across the country are proceeding with expansion plans, even though some 
government officials and industry leaders believe the problems in California 
could signal a national energy shortage. 
""The situation with PG&E is unique because of the situation in California,"" 
said Mark Stultz, vice president of public affairs and marketing for the 
trade group, which represents power marketers and generators. 
Energy giant Enron Corp. said yesterday it is nearing completion on a 1.2 
million-square-foot addition to its headquarters in a Houston office tower. 
Meanwhile, Orion Power Holdings Inc., a Baltimore company, said it still 
plans to build new electric plants in Southern Maryland and Kentucky. 
Other companies are planning plants in Fauquier and Loudoun counties in 
Northern Virginia, although elected officials in those counties say they are 
not needed.

INDIA: AES interested in Enron's Indian power plant.

06/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 28 (Reuters) - The Indian subsidiary of U.S. electricity firm 
AES Corp on Thursday said it ""would consider getting involved"" in the 
controversy-ridden Dabhol power project if an opportunity arose, but said it 
had made no formal proposal so far. 
U.S. energy giant Enron Corp could pull out of the $2.9 billion project as a 
result of a bitter dispute with the Indian state utility that has contracted 
to buy the power.
The wrangle had given rise to speculation that AES India could take over the 
project from Enron's Indian subsidiary, Dabhol Power Corporation. 
In a press statement, AES said it had neither made any formal proposal to 
stakeholders nor received any. 
AES was among the first global firms to enter India when its government 
liberalised the power sector in 1992, and has so far invested a total $155 
million in two separate projects. 
In 1998, it purchased 49 percent of Orissa Power Generation Corporation, when 
the eastern Indian state of Orissa's power assets were privatised. 
In September 1999 it also acquired the Central Electricity Supply Company of 
Orissa. 
AES initially came into India intending to develop and operate a coal-fired 
power plant in Orissa. But the project was delayed and is still under 
development. 
Enron's investment in the power plant, on the western coast of India, is the 
country's single largest direct foreign investment. 
But Dabhol Power Corporation and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board are 
now in the midst of an acrimonious row that threatens to scupper the 
high-profile project. 
The power firm claims the state utility has reneged on its contractual 
obligations by defaulting on payments, while the utility claims Dabhol has 
also violated several clauses in the contract. 
The dispute has brought bad publicity to Enron and hurt India's image among 
foreign investors, including other global power firms which had eagerly 
entered the potentially huge Indian power sector. 
""The commitment and willingness of parties to a contract...is an important 
consideration for our investment decision in any project,"" said AES's press 
release. 
""This is the basis for both our current investment and for any future 
investment we may make in India or any other country.""

Bush kicks off summer of fund raising with $20 million dinner
By SHARON THEIMER
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Republican lawmakers and donors partied around a giant ""W"" 
at a presidential dinner that raised more than $20 million for GOP 
congressional candidates. 
The Wednesday night dinner opened what party officials say will be a summer 
of fund raising by President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and Vice President 
Dick Cheney for Republican House and Senate candidates.
The invitation offered those contributing $25,000 and up ""the option to 
request a member of Congress and their guest to complete your table of 10."" 
The biggest donors got a chance to mingle with President Bush and Cheney at a 
predinner reception. 
Bush thanked contributors profusely in an 18-minute speech that touched on 
his policies on tax cuts, education and defense. 
""Make no mistake about it: This dinner has one goal in mind, to make sure 
Denny Hastert remains the speaker of the House and to make sure Trent Lott is 
the majority leader of the United States Senate,"" he said. 
More than 4,000 tickets were sold for the $2,500-per-plate event, topping the 
record $11.7 million the GOP's House-Senate dinner took in last year, when 
former President George H.W. Bush was the main speaker. 
Donors in tuxedos and gowns dined and drank around a giant gold ""W"" that 
reached to the rafters at the Washington Convention Center ballroom in honor 
of President Bush. Grilled tenderloin, sweet potato and corn souffle and 
assorted desserts were on the menu. 
Those hoping for quality time with the president may have been disappointed. 
He and Cheney left before the salad plates were cleared. 
Hastert of Illinois, Lott of Mississippi and former House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich of Georgia were among politicians mixing with contributors. 
The dinner program listed dozens of corporate sponsors representing a wide 
range of industries, including Microsoft, American Airlines, Philip Morris, 
Enron, AT&T, Dow Chemical, Walt Disney and eBay, to name a few. 
Bruce Gates, a lobbyist for the Health Benefits Coalition, was one of the 
event's co-chairmen. The group of insurers and business associations is 
fighting pending Senate legislation that would give patients broad rights to 
sue their managed-care plans. 
Co-chairman Jim Anderson of the National Association of Wholesaler 
Distributors, which is also a Health Benefits Coalition member, dined at one 
of the head tables with Cheney. Anderson said he has taken part in several 
House-Senate dinners. 
""We do it because we support the policies of this administration. We support 
the policies of the Republicans in the House and Senate with respect to the 
issues our members care about,"" Anderson said, citing taxes, labor-management 
relations and health care. 
The Republican and Democratic parties are both raising money at a record clip 
for next year's battle over House and Senate control. 
And both are rolling out star power - political and otherwise - to do it. 
Wynonna Judd entertained donors at Wednesday's GOP fund-raiser. Roberta Flack 
is performing at a $1 million Democratic National Committee event Thursday 
night. 
Former vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman is the featured guest at 
the DNC fund-raiser. The Connecticut senator, Senate Majority Leader Tom 
Daschle of South Dakota and former President Clinton have all headlined 
Democratic fund-raisers in recent weeks and are expected to do more this 
summer. 
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is inviting big donors to spend 
July 6-8 on the Massachusetts island of Nantucket dining and sailing with 
Daschle and more than a dozen other senators. Those giving $20,000 in 
federally regulated donations or $50,000 in unregulated ""soft money"" are 
invited. 
The McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill pending in Congress would ban the 
large soft-money contributions the parties commonly take in at big 
fund-raisers.

State energy crisis may imperil future of deregulation, consumer choice
By DON THOMPSON
Associated Press Writer

06/27/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - California's energy crisis may claim a substantial victim: 
deregulation itself. 
""Never again will we embrace a free market - it's too expensive,"" Gov. Gray 
Davis' chief energy adviser, S. David Freeman, predicted Wednesday.
""The marketplace is blind to the need for cleaner air, it is blind to the 
needs of consumers in a shortage, and it produces a shortage with its 
volatility,"" the former head of the Los Angeles and Sacramento municipal 
power agencies told a Senate committee plotting California's energy future. 
The state's flawed 1996 law freed wholesale electricity rates while capping 
retail power prices, leaving the state's three investor-owned utilities 
trapped in between. 
Now the state has signed $43 billion worth of long-term energy contracts, and 
created a power authority that could build its own power plants. 
Its Public Utilities Commission stands ready to bar businesses from freely 
swapping power providers - the incentive that prompted deregulation in the 
first place. 
Davis wants lawmakers to approve buying the electricity transmission lines 
from two of the three cash-strapped utilities, and wants to buy the lines of 
the state's largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, out of bankruptcy 
court. 
Consumer groups say the state should buy the utilities' hydroelectric 
generation and other assets as well, as part of a return to regulation and a 
shift to publicly owned power supplies. 
""Look what deregulation and handing our electricity supply over to a bunch of 
private companies has done for us - 50 percent (rate) increases and $20 
billion in surcharges. Thank you very much, but no thank you,"" Harvey 
Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights said last week. 
He argued the state should buy all three utilities at their current 
""fire-sale prices"" - ""We're talking about picking them up for a 
dime-for-a-dollar when they're totally out of cash."" 
Enron Corp. President and CEO Jeffrey Skilling is among those urging the 
state to do the opposite and create a truly open market. Public power only 
drives up costs and lowers accountability, he said. 
""If you had an open competitive marketplace and not put restrictions on that 
marketplace, I guarantee you the price of power in California will be 
significantly lower,"" he said in a San Francisco speech last week entitled, 
""The arrogance of regulation."" 
""California needs to get deregulation right and the rest of the country needs 
to get deregulation right,"" Skilling said, shortly after he was hit by a pie 
thrown by an irate electricity consumer. 
That means giving consumers more immediate price incentives, other free 
marketers told the Senate Energy Committee Wednesday. 
Tiered electricity rates would reward consumers who confine their electricity 
use to lower, cheaper ""tiers"" of energy consumption. 
Real-time electricity meters would let consumers see the price they are 
paying at any given time of day or night, encouraging them to, say, run their 
clothes dryer at 3 a.m. when power would be cheaper. 
Business' demand for choice drove the deregulation movement, when industries 
sought the ability to choose among energy wholesalers or generators rather 
than being locked into buying their money through a local utility. 
But PUC President Loretta Lynch predicted the commission will block that 
choice Tuesday, for fear departing customers will leave residential and other 
small consumers to pay a larger share of the $8.2 billion the state has 
authorized for power buys. 
The move was panned by generators and business groups as a step backward. 
Southern California Edison Vice President Bob Foster predicted the state will 
end up regulating all three legs of its power grid: generation, transmission 
and distribution. Regulation is needed to smooth out the boom-and-bust 
business cycle that California has seen so graphically in the last year, he 
said. 
Freeman predicted the state will likely wind up with some sort of ""hybrid"" of 
government regulation that will rein in the excesses of a free market. 
""It's impossible to say at the moment whether the (investor-owned) utilities 
will revive,"" he warned. If they do, he said their corporate boards may opt 
to chase the higher profits of the open market while shedding their 
transmission and distribution systems to state control. 
Yet Freeman and California Energy Commission Chairman Bill Keese predicted 
residential and business consumers may soon see the sort of freedom of choice 
they now could only dream about, once fuel cells, photovoltaic generation and 
micro-turbines become commonplace. 
""The future perhaps belongs to a whole new set of competitors,"" Freeman said. 
""These central station power generators are not going to have it all to 
themselves.""

Pennsylvania's First Successful CDS Auction
?
An important new regulatory skirmish has broken out before the Pennsylvania=
 =20
Public Utility Commission (PUC) over which company has won the right to=20
provide  default generation service to 300,000 customers of PECO Energy, an=
=20
Exelon  Company. This skirmish is actually good news for consumers and is t=
he=20
fruit of  the 1998 PECO Energy restructuring settlement agreement, a landma=
rk=20
document  that ended a ferocious regulatory war when all combatants signed=
=20
it.=20
?
The =01&peace treaty=018 includes a requirement that PECO Energy bid out de=
fault =20
service for 20% of its customers, and PECO has done so. Green Mountain=20
Energy  Company is now challenging PECO Energy=01,s decision that New Power=
 won=20
the auction  to provide the settlement=01,s mandated default service.=20
?
Both Green Mountain and New Power are offering those 300,000 consumers  sma=
ll=20
rate reductions compared to customers receiving default service from PECO, =
=20
and more electricity generated from renewable energy resources.=20
Specifically,  New Power and Green Mountain are offering generation service=
=20
to Rate R  residential customers for approximately 5.54 cents per=20
kilowatt-hour. That offer  is 3.11 cents per kilowatt-hour less than PECO=
=20
Energy=01,s unbundled generation and  transmission rate of 8.65 cents per=
=20
kilowatt-hour and 0.11 cents per  kilowatt-hour less than the shopping cred=
it=20
of 5.65.=20
?
The consumer savings that these offers represent is masked or reduced by  t=
he=20
stranded cost payments that consumers must pay PECO Energy. Indeed, were it=
 =20
not for stranded cost payments, the New Power and Green Mountain offers=20
would  reduce total bills by about 3.11 cents per kilowatt-hour, or 20%.=20
?
The dispute between New Power and Green Mountain is noteworthy because it =
=20
proves that companies will compete vigorously to provide default service if=
 =20
shopping credits and lengths of contracts are set at reasonable levels. It=
=20
also  shows that renewable energy portfolio standards can be met=20
economically.  Finally, the result of this case will switch more customers =
to=20
competitive  suppliers in one day than the total number who switched in=20
California over a  period of nearly three years.=20
?
When the PUC anoints New Power or Green Mountain as the winner, if all =20
299,300 consumers opt to stay with the CDS provider, the total number of =
=20
customers in Pennsylvania that will be served by a competitive supplier wil=
l =20
jump to more than 850,000. Of this total, 504,000 will be residential=20
customers  of PECO, a number equal to 37% of the PECO residential class.
?
CDS Background: In Pennsylvania, there must always be a =01&default=018 sup=
plier =20
or =01&provider of last resort=018 to assure that service is always availab=
le to=20
all  customers. The incumbent utility is the default supplier, unless the P=
UC=20
decides  otherwise. The default supplier must provide generation service to=
=20
customers who  do not have a competitive supplier either because they chose=
=20
not to shop or did  not find a willing supplier at an acceptable price. The=
=20
PECO Restructuring Case  Settlement initially defined CDS service in=20
paragraph 38:
?
=01&On January 1, 2001, 20% of all of PECO=01,s residential customers -- =

=20
of a  Commission-approved energy and capacity market price bidding process.=
=20
This  service shall be referred to as Competitive Default Service (=01&CDS=
=018).=018
?
The same approach was used in the other Settlements in the GPU, PPL and APS=
 =20
restructuring cases. CDS reflects an effort to assure that there is at leas=
t=20
one  other large competitor in each market. CDS also has a renewable=20
portfolio  standard (RPS), even though there is no RPS for regulated=20
utilities in  Pennsylvania. The winning bidder must supply:=20

=01&=01(2.0% of its offered energy supply for CDS service from renewable  r=

=20

renewable energy increment shall increase by annual increments of 0.5% =20

?
This increasing renewable requirement continues indefinitely, meaning that =
=20
in year four of the CDS there will be a 3.5% renewable requirement, 4% in=

PECO issued its initial RFP for CDS on April 6, 2000, and Shell Energy =20

PECO and New Power negotiated a complete contract that is before the PUC  f=

the =20
shopping credit, while residential heating customers on Rate RH would pay=

1.02%  less than their shopping credit. For a Rate R customer, this would=

As you've heard from Paul, I'm going to be working with your team to devise 
some very specific and concrete strategies to enhance the way you, both 
individually and as a group of co-workers, contribute to achieving the 
business goals established for your office.  

I'm going to be on your conference call this coming Thursday to give you an 
overview of the process Paul and I have discussed. I'll try to answer 
questions and give you as much insight and ""comfort"" as I can. I know it's a 
bit awkward working on an effort such as this with someone you've never laid 
eyes on. It was for that reason I was hoping that I'd be able join your staff 
meeting in person this week and meet you ""face-to-face"" but the stars didn't 
align quite right so that's just going to have to wait a few weeks. The 
trusty e-mail system and the telephone will just have to suffice for our 
initial work together!

The first part of this process is to get some ""base line"" data so that there 
is a sort of ""level playing field"" of information that we're working with. 
Recognizing that you're already deluged with surveys and assessments, it is 
only after great consideration that I'm asking you to complete the one that's 
attached to this note! Frankly, there's just no easy way to get this initial 
perspective so I hope you'll understand. 

Here's what I'd like you to do: 
 - Complete the assessment - it's only 25 items in length and all are pretty 
straightforward.
 - Print off a hard copy and hold on to the assessment! Just keep it with you.
 - When we ""talk"" on the conference call this Thursday, 4/13, be prepared to 
work with me on setting-up
    a time for you and me to have about 45 minutes or an hour to go over your 
responses in some detail - on the      telephone, unfortunately.   

I'll write this to you now and will say it to you in the future -  everything 
we discuss is strictly confidential. My interest is only in establishing some 
understanding of the work climate within your team. 

After I've gathered the assessment and discussion information and have had a 
chance to review and digest it, I'll be coming out to your fair city for an 
""off-site"" workshop. I'll tell you more about that on Thursday in addition to 
setting some dates on which to hold the workshop that will work for all of 
you (I know that's going to be the challenge!) 

One final word (or two): My intention in this work with you and your team 
will be strictly focused on the ""here and now"" and on what future, specific 
action items we can identify and implement that will enhance your individual 
and team performance to produce the desired business results.    

Talk with you on Thursday and I'm looking forward to working with you.

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Stumbling points in California's deregulated power

There is concern that California's early restructuring problems will throw

""As California goes, so goes the country,"" Massey said.

 Hope to see you soon.

Hey Everyone,

Attached below are invites to a couple of overnight affairs I am organizing
up on Mt. Tam in August.  I have reserved the West Point Inn on both August
4 and August 18th.  It is usually a great great time.  People hike up
there, and hang out all
afternoon and evening and then sleep over.  We cook dinner and do various
things in the evening (ie games, singing, guitar, etc.).  EVERYONE helps
with the process (ie cooking, cleaning, etc.).  In the morning we will make
up breakfast.

The cost is $50 per person.  This covers lodging ($30 per person), snacks,
dinner, drinks, and breakfast.  People should not have to bring anything to
eat or drink except for maybe water for the hike.

I usually try to have a mix of couples and singles to make it fun for
everyone.  I hope you can make it.  Let me know if you are interested.

478,"I don't agree Edison's premise -- that ""direct access customers contributed=
 just as much to SCE's procurement costs undercollection as bundled service=
 customers."" We need to make clear that we don't buy in to their rhetoric.

Here's my reasoning.

DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers. SCE had to bu=
y power to serve the bundled load.  SCE did not buy power for DA customers.=
  SCE's purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high =
wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for =
the undercollection. I can make the argument that the undercollection is SO=
LELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE.

There are two big reasons that back me up: AB 1890 and Top-down rates.  I w=
ill explain.  The utilities got what they wanted out of AB 1890 -- payments=
 of $30 plus billion in so-called stranded costs and a real delay in any co=
mpetitive retail market until their costs were paid off.  One of the tradeo=
ffs, however, was that the utilities were at risk FOR HIGH PRICES in the WH=
OLESALE MARKET.  Everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or =
bad hydro years, the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their bill=
ions by the 3/31/01 deadline. That's the risk they agreed to.  Now, they ar=
e claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more.  This is in dire=
ct conflict with the statute. I can make the argument that the statute requ=
ires SCE to assume this risk and therefore any undercollection is theirs al=
one -- now the CPUC can bail them out -- but that doesn't make ESPs subject=
 to any presumed ""undercollection.""

Now to the rates.  At the beginning of DA, the utilities did not want to do=
 a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and the =
retail busness from T&D. So, they did a ""top-down"" calculation.  This meant=
 that there had to be a ""credit"" put on the bills of DA customers to accoun=
t for the costs the utility avoided by having the customers switch to DA. S=
o, the PX Credit structure was a direct result of the utilities unwillingne=
ss to unbundle specific components of the rates.  Next, although bundled cu=
stomers rates were capped, the decisions from the CPUC made it clear that t=
here was no similar cap for DA customers -- their rates and bills would be =
whatever was charged by their ESPs.  However, when the utilities filed thei=
r tariffs with the CPUC, they added a cap for the PX credit that was neithe=
r proposed nor authorized by the Commission.  Enron attacked it, but got no=
where, until WPTF and Enron brought it up in the 1998 RAP Proceeding. Our a=
rgument was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA cust=
omers -- and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilit=
ies avoided by not serving DA customers.  We argued that anything less is f=
undamentally unfair and anticomeptitive.  The utilities must have thought w=
e had a good case, because they agreed to settle. The settlement was accept=
ed by the Commission in the proceeding. Everyone understood that eliminatin=
g the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to allow the PX Credit to FLOAT AB=
OVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were high. So, we have a legal right to r=
eceive the full PX Credit/Negative CTC which is separate and distinct from =
any undercollection associated with bundled customers. It seems as if we sh=
ould be able to prosecute this legal right. (keeping in mind I am not an at=
torney)=20

In summary, we have leverage and should use it.

I hope you had a good Thanks Giving with no power emergencies. I would also

contact with several very interested VCs. And this is where some validation
and a spokesperson would be most beneficial to us.

At present Ariba has validated our technology and their Director of Global
Network Operations has agreed to be a spokesperson for this phase in
Cambira's evolution. In fact, we are discussing a potential joint
development effort for service integration with them. We are hoping to
secure similar support from Enron, and this is really where I would like to
direct desire. I know your schedule is very busy and I appreciate your

DALLAS, May 21 (Reuters) - El Paso Corp. had no incentive to inflate natural 
gas prices on its pipelines to California because it had hedged most of its 
gas to third parties before prices took off last year, the gas company's top 
executive said on Monday. 
The Houston-based company is currently fighting price-gouging claims brought 
to federal regulators by the California Public Utility Commission and that 
state's two largest investor-owned utilities, PG&E Corp.'s . Pacific Gas & 
Electric and Edison International's Southern California Edison.
El Paso Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer William Wise told 
Reuters he expects his company to be cleared once it makes its case to the 
U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in hearings this week. 
""The last piece we think is very elemental and so easy to understand is that 
we hedged our capacity into California. If we thought the gas prices were 
going to go up, we wouldn't have hedged it. We were hedging it because we 
thought prices would be flat or down,"" Wise said in his first interview on 
the topic since El Paso began fighting the accusations several months ago. 
Even SoCal Edison's main witness admitted during testimony last week that it 
would be irrational for a market manipulator to hedge like El Paso did, Wise 
said. Ninety percent of El Paso's gas was hedged to others in the period 
during which the company was alleged to have raised prices. 
On Monday, lawyers for El Paso continued fighting those accusations in 
proceedings before FERC Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner. 
The California trio alleges El Paso, California's largest natural gas 
supplier, withheld capacity on its four pipelines into the state from March 
through November 2000 in order to inflate prices. The CPUC alleges that cost 
Californians an additional $3.7 billion. 
Even in the worst case, if Wagner substantiates the claims and orders El Paso 
to refund some of the money it made, Wise said the exposure will not be 
great. 
""I think in total last year, we didn't make more than $100 million in 
California,"" Wise said during an interview following El Paso's annual 
shareholder's meeting in Dallas. 
The FERC already rejected a related accusation from the CPUC, which charged 
El Paso rigged bidding in a capacity auction for its main pipeline into 
California to favor a sister company. 
Wise said he was confident that El Paso would prove that it did not withhold 
pipeline capacity, as the company's accusers have alleged. 
The genesis of the complaints to FERC is a desire by the utilities and the 
CPUC to shift blame, Wise said. 
""They're attempting to deflect away from decades of bad policy and bad 
business decisions, both by the public utility commission and by the 
utilities in which they did not build power plants and they did not build 
natural gas infrastructure within the state,"" Wise said. 
The most glaring infrastructure problem is the limited capacity to move gas 
inside of California, especially from south to north. The utilities 
traditionally countered that by storing natural gas, but Wise said they made 
a critical mistake last year by selling stored gas at an arbitraged profit. 
""They depleted storage, and by the time they figured this out, they needed 
every bit of capacity just to serve the market and they had no capacity to 
refill storage,"" Wise said. ""Economics 101 would tell you you're going to get 
prices spikes, and that's exactly what happened."" 
ACQUISITIONS STILL ON RADAR 
Outside of California, Wise said that EL Paso will remain an active acquirer, 
given its track record of executing mergers and acquisitions like its recent 
$24 billion purchase of Coastal Corp. 
""Do we buy an electric utility? Do we buy more (exploration and production)? 
The market should expect us to do merger and acquisition activity within the 
playing field that we have a demonstrated expertise in,"" Wise said. 
Asked whether he had any interest in hometown rival Enron Corp.'s Portland 
General utility, which is on the block again after Enron's $3 billion sale 
with Sierra Pacific Resources Corp. fell through last month, Wise answered: 
""The utility side of the business is not my favorite side of the business. 
The generation side of a utility could be interesting,"" Wise said.

Former TVA director signs as Enron lobbyist

05/21/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Johnny Hayes, a former Tennessee Valley Authority 
director, has been hired to lobby Congress for electric wholesaler Enron 
Corp., a potential TVA competitor. 
Hayes, who resigned from the three-member TVA board in January 1999 to become 
the top fund-raiser for Al Gore's presidential campaign, registered this 
month to lobby for Houston, Texas-based Enron, The Knoxville News-Sentinel's 
Washington bureau reported Sunday.
Enron is one of the nation's largest energy companies, reporting $101 billion 
in revenues last year compared to government-owned TVA's $6.7 billion. 
Enron spokesman Eric Thode confirmed Hayes has been hired to work for the 
company, but refused to say his salary. Enron paid another lobbyist $415,000 
last year, records show. Hayes' salary at TVA was $118,400 annually. 
Hayes, a former Tennessee economic and community development commissioner who 
lived in Gallatin, did not immediately return calls to The Associated Press 
for comment. 
Stephen Smith, executive director of the TVA watchdog and environmentalist 
group Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said he is concerned about a TVA 
insider joining ranks with a potential TVA competitor. 
""As a board member for TVA, one knows where a lot of the skeletons are 
throughout the agency,"" Smith said. ""What is always a concern is when you 
step out away from the organization, do you potentially now profit from that 
and turn it against consumers in the Valley?"" 
Hayes was hired to lobby ""on energy issues, TVA-related, kind of a host of 
issues that would affect that area and be related to energy,"" Thode said. 
The lobbying ""may include TVA, but it would be a variety of things,"" he said. 
""We're looking at things, projects all over the nation at all times."" 
TVA and Enron have done business before. TVA contracted with Enron to provide 
power during peak periods in the summers of 1998 and 1999. When Enron failed 
to deliver, TVA sued and recovered more than $200 million. 
That experience also resulted in TVA deciding to devote money that might have 
been used to trim its $26 billion debt to buying more peak-power gas turbines 
of its own. 
Hayes, who registered under the company name of Sideview Partners Inc., also 
signed up to lobby for Gas Generation, a subsidiary of Tractebel Power Inc. 
of Houston, and Voith Siemens Hydro Power Generation, a Pennsylvannia company

POWER POINTS:Great News! Long-Term Contracts Jeopardized

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Those looking for even the slightest bit of good news 
for the state of California can find it in Friday's San Jose Mercury News. 
""California is in danger of losing more than 40% of the power it has lined up 
in long-term contracts,"" says the lead of a major article, because 
Republicans in the state legislature didn't back the $12.5 billion bond deal 
last week.
Getting out of most of those contracts would be the best thing to happen to 
California in a long time. 
Since the state went on its long-term buying binge, forward prices for power 
in the western U.S. have been falling steadily. Gov. Gray Davis announced $43 
billion in purchases lasting up to 20 years on March 5. Contracts for summer 
power at Palo Verde, Ariz., a key western trading hub that feeds a lot of 
power into California, have fallen to $390 a megawatt-hour from a high of 
$600/MWh in late March. Further out, power for 2004-2006 at mid-Columbia 
River, a key trading hub north of California, has fallen from $58/MWh in 
February to $49/MWh today. 
Companies like Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Dynegy (DYN) that took advantage of 
the state's buying binge are looking pretty fat and happy. In fact, they have 
affectionately started calling the governor Gravy Days. Enron Corp. (ENE), 
which has been selling aggressively for two months, according to traders, is 
looking like a genius as usual. Generators that held out, like Reliant Energy 
(REI) and Duke Energy (DUK), may be sorry that they did. 
It's been a long time since those long on western power have felt serious 
pain in the markets, but that time has come. Power generators may not make as 
much profit this summer as last, and power traders that have taken long 
speculative positions may liquidate supplies for far less than they bought 
them. As was seen in the eastern U.S. power markets last summer, long 
positions can turn out just as painful as short positions. 
For California, the good news is that maybe spot purchasing costs this summer 
won't be as bad as once expected. The bad news is that the state government 
is by far the biggest ""long"" in the bearish forward market. It's safe to say 
that the $43 billion in contracts signed in March have declined in value by 
15%, or $6.5 billion. That's almost as big of a financial disaster going 
forward as everything that has gone on since last summer until now. 
Granted, this is a sort of damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don't situation. 
Barring the utilities from the forward market during the first three years of 
deregulation was one of the most expensive public policy mistakes in U.S. 
history. California should do some forward purchasing now, and it's such a 
behemoth that it will move the market up when it does so. And, when it gets 
done buying, prices will come down simply because it stopped. 
But that's a footnote to the mismanagement of the financial side of the 
energy crisis. Early this year, when the state started down the path of 
mega-purchasing, there was no shortage of advice not to do so. Long-term 
prices were embedded with too much of today's supply-demand imbalance. The 
state would have been much better off dealing with the imbalance first - 
since it would have to do that anyway - and gradually securing forward power 
as declining prices reflected the improving situation. 
Since then, the state has done a great job of crushing demand. Electric usage 
is already down 9% from where it was expected to be thanks to a conservation 
efforts and a slowing economy, and people haven't even seen their 30% higher 
bills yet. Similar reduction has been seen in power consumption in other 
western states and in natural gas usage nationally. This is likely what has 
been behind much of the downturn in forward power prices in the West. 
This column started with a false ""good news"" lead. It would be great for the 
state if, after the state's credit rating sinks further, sellers exercised 
their option to tear up the five- and ten-year contracts. But they won't do 
that. The prices are too good from the sellers' perspective. Calpine, which 
has signed three such contracts for the state, said immediately that it has 
no intention of reneging on its agreements. And Gary Ackerman, director of 
the sellers' association, told the Mercury News that he didn't expect power 
companies in general to back out of the deals. 
But there may be some real good news for California. The Davis administration 
hired dozens of people that have little or no experience in energy trading to 
purchase billions of dollars of power. Perhaps they are quick learners. This 
week presented an excellent opportunity for the state to pick up what it 
needs - summer power for this year only - on sale. Low prices in the daily 
market Monday and Tuesday drove the summer contract prices down to $325/MWh, 
which is cheap by recent standards. The contract price moved up to $390/MWh, 
but the state took advantage of the opportunity while the window was open. 
""The week's condition in the market place helped. We were able to procure 
some energy for June through September,"" said state spokesman Oscar Hidalgo. 
And, hey, there were no blackouts this week.

512,"Kenny's comments are absolutely false or, at best,  grossly misleading.  We 
need to respond to him.

The NUMBER ONE problem we have in California that is delaying our proposed 
power plant developments is securing ERCs.  My discussions with Calpine 
indicate that ERCs are their biggest problem as well.  (And in case someone 
hasn't noticed, the two most active developers in CAlifornia are Enron and 
Calpine.)  Air quality laws are definitely slowing us down, and slowing 
others down, which keeps the new, cleaner plants from being developed.  As I 
have mentioned before, this is actually making air quality worse in that the 
older, dirtier plants are running more.  Further, if you do the math, we will 
probably never make up for the dirty air that is created by keeping the dirty 
plants in business because of grandfathering, while the clean plants don't 
get done because of ever more rigorous BACT standards and lack of ERCs.    

Having said that, I do not agree that we should send a message that we want 
to relax or suspend the standards.  (However, getting 2ppm plants on line, 
which will put out of business the 100+ppm plants - as Calpine indicated to 
me happened in Texas - makes the point that maybe a relaxation or suspension 
is the environmentally appropriate thing to do.)  All in all, though, I 
believe that sucha common sense approach will go nowhere in California 
because the little people in the regulatory positions as well as the public 
will make sure that we pay for such a message.  Having said that, I will 
repeat the key things that we should be promoting, in my opinion:  1.)  stop 
the EPA from tightening the BACT standards to ever increasing levels of 
insanity.  (GE will not guarantee the present, and new, EPA requirement of 
2ppm, which EPA ""determined"" with no new operating data.  They just did it 
because they could.)  2.)  Stop making up rules for RACT adjustments.  (Kelly 
Brodbeck is working very hard, for example, to develop a program in the Bay 
Area to retrofit boats with clean burning engines to create ERCs.  A high 
level staff guy at BAAQMD ""believes"" that we should be RACT adjusted, 
probably making the program uneconomic.  There isn't even unanimity for this 
position on his staff.  However, this position if it sticks is irresponsible 
in light of the fact that the boats can just keep on doing what they are 
doing.  We are creating ERCs, which the BAAQMD will take a portion of in 
their haircut, and in using the ERCs, we will eventually put out of business 
the dirtier plants.  So, our program gets RACT adjusted and the air gets 
dirtier...)  3.)  Allow for payment of mitigation fees in lieu of buying 
ERCs.  There is precedent for that, but this has to be run through the SIP 
and the EPA.  Again, the in-lieu fees can be used for gov sponsored ERC 
developments (e.g., electric lawn mowers, electric water heaters, etc.), 
which will clean the air.  I am aware that Sandy is working with the CA 
legislature on this.  Go Sandy!

513,"Assemblywoman Corbett will likely propose  amendments at Monday's Rev & Tax 
Cmte hearing on her AB 128x. Apparently,  the amendments will require that 
the PUC set a ""fair price"" for  electricity.? Any charges above that fair 
price?will be subject to the  proposed excess profits tax.
Also of interest is that the excess profits tax  would attempt to apply to 
out-of-state companies that sell energy into  California.? They are going to 
try to impute nexus to the out-of-state  generators by arguing that they are 
deriving economic benefit from selling into  California and that creates 
nexus.
Finally, it appears that the Suspense File will not  be invoked in this case 
because that policy only applies to Regular Session  bills. Obviously, AB 
128x is a Special Session bill.

523,"There is 4 proposed decisions that came out today. The CPUC is set to vote =

them tomorrow.  Here is a quick overview:

1) Two decisions address how much money is collected for going forward=20
electric energy costs and how much of that is paid to CDWR. Average rates a=

to increase 3c/kWh.  Further the AB1x  1 c/kWh is to continue.   Thus, the=

total increase, relative to rates in effect in year 2000,  is 4 c/kWh=20
($40/MWh). Lynch was very unclear how this rate would be implemented for=20
residential customers (a tiering proposal will be heard separately and take=
=20
30-45 days to implement).  One of these decisions addresses how to measure=
=20
past undercollections but as far as rate increases go, they are to cover on=
ly=20
going forward costs.
2) One decision addresses QF issues.  I have not seen the PD (It is expecte=
d=20
out shortly).  The Wood PD revises his revised PD of last week (yes, a=20
revised, revised PD) as follows:
a) Requires QFs to be paid on a going forward basis (as of 4/1/01). Utiliti=
es=20
to pay within 15 days upon presentation of an invoice.  No help for past du=
e=20
amounts, however.
b) Change the SRAC energy index from Topock to Malin.  Such a change will=
=20
lower the SRAC energy by =01&4 c/kWh=018.  This is a 15% to 25% hit to SRAC=
=20
relative to the status quo, which is based more or entirely on Topock.
c) Calls for workshops to further refine the gas basis for SRAC and address=
=20
other factors in the SRAC formula such as heat rates and O&M factors=20
d) Works with Section 390, as is, does not depend on a legislative change
i) Thus the reason why SRAC is based upon a border price index.
e) Overall cap (i.e. 7.9 c/kWh) is dropped.
The fourth decision addresses an investigation of the utility holding=20
companies.  Basically the CPUC is going after utility holding companies for=
=20
funds to reduce the past undercollections.

Further Notes taken by Sue Mara during the press conference:

Lynch and Wood Running the meeting

Lynch started out castigating FERC for the ""failure to act"", sellers for hi=
gh=20
prices forcing CA into this action.  Has some charts in the press package. =
=20
Talked about how wonderful the Govs proposals have been.  Said net short is=

ts=20
-- this doesn't address the ""$ for the hot dog, which is being taken care o=

Treasurer to issue bonds.  Continues to castigate FERC throughout the call.=
=20
Wants new appointments to FERC from the states -- ""our cries have fallen on=
=20
deaf ears""

Lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow:

1.  Wood's proposal -- modified -- Order the IOUs to pay the QFs beginning=
=20
4/1 on a going forward basis only.  Modified existing formula in Section 39=
0=20
(Legislative change to this section did not pass yet).  Shifts the gas inde=
x=20
from Topoc (where Wood says the prices are being mnipulated) to Malin, wher=
e=20
prices have been more stable.

2. Sets the CA Procurement Adjustment -- Orders the IOUs to pay the DWR for=
=20
purchases.  At one point she said that the order would be for all power for=
=20
purchased by the state beginning Jan 19; at another point she said that the=
=20
payments are for going forward costs. ""It's time to pay the power bills for=
=20
California.""  CPA calculated based on the ""residual"" method, rather than th=
e=20
proportional method.  Payments to DWR made on the proportional method,=20
however.

3.  Lynch alternate setting a 3 cents/kWh increase in accordance with AB 1X=
.=20
(The ALJ decision said no rate increase.) Makes the 1 cent temp charge=20
permanent (didn't say if its additive with the 3 cents) Believe this covers=
=20
ALL needs on a going forward basis.  According to  ABX 1, small customers=
=20
with 130% over baseline get no increase, small customers with 200% increase=
,=20
get a 9 % increase -- the rest get socked, I guess.  Adopted TURN's=20
accounting proposal.  Will look at rate design in a future proceeding.  Tak=
es=20
IOUs 30-45 days to charge the rates; will conduct a rate design proceeding=
=20
during that time period (see # 5).

4. Orders an investigation into the Utility holding company structure to se=
e=20
if it is best for the public utilities.

A new proceeding was also identified.

5.  Lynch is issuing an Assigned Comissioner ruling proposing a new rate=20
structure. (I presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use) =
=20
Need information from DWR to calculate rates and DWR has not yet provided=
=20
it.  Described the need to have a record on this. As mentioned in #3 above =
--=20
would expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30- 45 days.

In one of the above orders, Lynch said that she orders the utililities to g=
o=20
after sellers using all legal means for the unjust and unreasonable prices.

I'm still listening.

larger commodity charge because SDG&E customers will receive a lump sum 
reimbursement from SDG&E over those two months. SDG&E customers will expect

may be detrimental to EESI to the extent the customer does not curtail and 
EESI is expected to cover the cost of the penalties per our contract with the

pay the penalties.  The plan does provide for putting the customer in a 
Rotating Outage queue
if the customers fails to curtail on two occassions.  In my opinion, there

 CONTENTS Recession Risk is Rising, According to Research by Professor 
Kenneth Rosen FCC Commissioner to Speak at Workshop on ""Regulating on the 
Technological Edge"" Thomas Siebel Inaugurates Second Year of Fisher Center 
Seminar Series Former Oracle President and COO Ray Lane Predicts the Future 
for Dot-Coms  Dean Emeritus Earl ""Budd"" Cheit Honored by Cal Performances New 
Faces at Haas Haas in the News Happening at Haas Haas Celebrations


RECESSION RISK IS RISING, ACCORDING TO RESEARCH BY PROFESSOR KENNETH ROSEN
The risk that the US economy is headed for a recession is rising, according 
to new research by Prof. Kenneth Rosen, co-chair of the Fisher Center for 
Real Estate and Urban Economies at the Haas School, and his co-author Amanda 
Howard, senior analyst at the consulting firm RCG. Rosen and Howard based 
their conclusion on a study of eight leading economic indicators.

""While advancements in technology have enabled notable productivity 
improvements, those gains are over-stated,"" say the authors about the 
argument that increased productivity levels will continue to ward off a 
recession. ""The US sits on the high end of an economic seesaw, held up by a 
series of related -- and increasingly less sturdy -- imbalances.""

High oil prices, a tight labor market, and a potentially weaker dollar will 
encourage price and wage inflation, and potentially even higher interest 
rates, say the authors. At the same time, likely declines in foreign 
investment and venture capital funding would encourage the stock market 
bubble to burst and thus reduce consumer spending.

As the technology sector continues to contract and without venture capital 
funding to support the large percentage of unprofitable Internet businesses, 
a substantial number of jobs will be lost, argue Howard and Rosen. Under 
these circumstances, the record level of private sector debt and the negative 
personal savings rate would become increasingly problematic.

""It is the interaction of all of these imbalances that make the risk of a 
recession so great,"" conclude the authors. 

FCC COMMISSIONER TO SPEAK AT WORKSHOP ON ""REGULATING ON THE TECHNOLOGICAL 
EDGE""
 Federal Communications Commissioner Michael K. Powell will give the keynote 
address to the ""Regulating on the Technological Edge"" workshop on Friday, 
October 20, at 4:00 p.m. in the Arthur Andersen Auditorium. All faculty, 
students, staff, and alumni are invited to attend this speech. 

Powell has served as a commissioner since 1997. Prior to joining the FCC, 
Powell was chief of staff to the Antitrust Division of the Department of 
Justice. He earned his JD from Georgetown University and clerked for a judge 
on United States Court of Appeals before he joined the Washington DC law firm 
of O'Melveny & Meyers LLP. In his practice he focused on regulatory matters 
involving telecommunications, antitrust, and employment law. 

This speech is the only event in the workshop series that is open to the 
public. The regulation workshop is an invitation-only event for academics, 
regulators, and industry leaders geared towards addressing the issue of 
regulation of emerging technologies. For more information, contact Anita 
Patterson at 510-642-4233.

THOMAS SIEBEL INAUGURATES SECOND YEAR OF FISHER CENTER SEMINAR SERIES
 The founder of one of the fastest growing companies in America, Thomas 
Siebel, chairman and CEO of Siebel Systems, is coming to Haas to share the 
secrets of his success with the Haas community on Tuesday, October 31, as the 
first speaker in this year's Fisher Center E-Commerce Executives Seminar 
series. 

All students, faculty, staff, and alumni are invited to attend the seminar, 
which takes place Tuesday, October 31, from 12:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. in the 
Wells Fargo Room. Seats will be given on a first-come, first-served basis.

Siebel Systems provides an integrated set of e-business application software 
that enables multi-channel sales, marketing, and customer service systems to 
be deployed over the Web, call centers, the field, resellers, retail, and 
dealer networks.? Siebel Systems has grown from $50,000 in revenues in 1994 
to $791 million in 1999. 

Siebel was recognized as one of the top 25 managers in the world by 
BusinessWeek in January 2000 and Siebel Systems was named the fastest growing 
company in 1999 by Fortune magazine. Siebel has authored two books on 
selling. His current book Cyber Rules, which details his business principles, 
was published in April 1999. 

Siebel began his career as employee number 50 at Oracle, after earning his 
bachelor's in History, a master's in Computer Science, and an MBA from the 
University of Illinois.? In 1990, he left Oracle and became CEO of Cayenne 
Systems, which he renamed Gain Technology and merged with Sybase. In 1993 he 
founded Siebel Systems.

FORMER ORACLE PRESIDENT AND COO RAY LANE PREDICTS THE FUTURE FOR DOT-COMS
Raymond J. Lane, former president of Oracle Corporation and new general 
partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & 
Byers (KPCB), will give his vision of the future of the New Economy to the 
Haas community on Friday, November 3, at 4:00 p.m. This event is the first of 
the 2000-2001 Business Faculty Research Dialogue: Shakeout in Cyberspace: 
What's Next for the Dot Coms. The event is open to the entire Haas School 
community. 

Since his change in positions, Lane has been quoted extensively that he 
believes the venture business is going to shift from just funding companies 
to playing an even larger role in building those companies. He told the 
Associated Press that KPCB will help to create the survivors in the impending 
dot-com shakeout. 

Lane has stated that the changes at Oracle announced by founder Larry Ellison 
sped up his departure, which he announced just before the July 4th weekend. 
Lane left Oracle with no severance package and had to give up $300 million in 
unvested stock options. Lane originally joined Oracle as president of Oracle 
USA after working as a senior partner in the consulting firm of Booz Allen & 
Hamilton. 

Lane has also stressed that his leaving Oracle was part of trying to create 
balance in his life, noting that the KPCB offices are just 5 minutes from his 
house. In addition, Lane and his wife have an 18-month-old son at home and a 
second child due in November. More information on Lane can be found at 
http://www.kpcb.com/.

The Business Faculty Research Dialogues will be sponsored again this year by 
the Clausen Center for International Business and Policy and California 
Management Review. 

Lane will speak in the Haas School's Arthur Andersen Auditorium at 4:00 p.m. 
on Friday November 3. There will be a reception at 5:00 p.m. following the 
lecture in the School's Bank of America Forum. Please contact Meredith 
LaCorte in the dean's office to reserve a space at either the lecture or the 
reception.? She can be reached at 510-643-2027 or in email at

revised sheet (there was a math error in the original), and my adds to Kim's

Kim's assumes that the $9,5 million includes pluses from things like dep/gain 
on sale, while mine assumes that it doesn't (i.e., Kim subtracts them, I add 
them).  No big deal, we just need to make an assumption and go with it.

573,"DJ PG&E Says Won't Try To Escape Rate
                  Freeze For Now >PCG 

                  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 


                  SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones)--PG&E Corp. (PCG) won't try to 
lift California's
                  state-mandated rate freeze before the end of the transition 
to a deregulated market,
                  saying it wants to protect its customers from volatile 
power prices, senior company
                  officials said Wednesday. 

                       ""We aren't moving at this time to end the rate freeze. 
But that view might change in
                  the future,"" said a senior company official, who requested 
anonymity. 

                       PG&E invited reporters to its headquarters Wednesday 
to discuss plans for repairing
                  a ""not workably competitive power market"" and several steps 
the utility plans to file
                  with federal regulators to do that. 

                       One proposal that is expected to be filed with the 
Federal Energy Regulatory
                  Commission is a return to cost-based rates, where the price 
for power would be
                  predetermined based on generation costs. The company wants 
to temporarily put an
                  end to market-based rates. 

                       The utility will also request that California's 
independent system operator reduce the
                  wholesale power price cap to $100 a megawatt-hour from 
$250/MWh. 

                       Company officials said those steps would allow them to 
recover billions of dollars in
                  unpaid power costs and would stabilize wholesale power 
prices and protect retail
                  customers. 

                       PG&E said generators would still be able to make a 
profit on power sold in California
                  with the reduced cap, and the company doesn't believe the 
state's power supply would
                  be in jeopardy from such an action.

Doing better next time.
I'm sitting here wondering at the age of 35 what makes ME happy. Do I really
know? What can I do to find out. What about those those things that do not
make me happy? The only thing to say in with you in mind. Is. You've managed
to be at both ends of the spectrum and not all by yourself. What I'm getting
at is. . . The only time(s) I've experienced periods of pain (with one
exception) with you is when you're involved with ANOTHER MAN. . . . . . . .
PREOCCUPIED on your part. That was someone more important to you, and was
that way for awhile. Now recent developments have occurred that's telling my
heart that history my be repeating itself. I know what you've told me, but
it seems all too familiar. Hey, this is me. Do what you want and who you
want to. I know that sounds familiar. You said, that things at Work and Home
have you mentally preoccupied. What's different from the first 2 times you
remembered and then with the last 3 times you forgot? Coincidence?  We both
know that Kevin will always be that Lazy/Self-Centered/Spoiled Brat of an
A##Hole, until he wants to do something for HIMSELF. As for work. You got it
good. I understand about that Childish-boy you call a Co-worker. And
everything associated with that mess. I could very easily use that same
excuse you did about forgetting anything. Have I ever forgotten you on
anything, regardless of what was going? ? ? Well. . . I'm waiting. ? ? ?
Sometimes I think I should be more of a Self-Centered/High Strung A##hole
and look out for myself. Maybe I wouldn't feel the I do about a lot of
things. But then again, Back to what's real. We're not Married, just
friends. At least, when I was reminded of that last week. Do whom that makes
you happy. You're a grown woman.
Well, I'll be here for you to tell me how wrong I am about everthing that
I've said. And I want you to do it with both barrels.

P.S.
I thought Birthdays other than Valentines Day and X-mas was a day that you
can show that special person how special they are to you. That must have
something I read in a Far Side cartoon clip or fiction novel somewhere.
Maybe I'm asking for too much.

You are hereby cordially invited to a pre-holiday office lunch this Thursday at approximately 11:30 a.m, courtesy of the Trading Attorneys.

LEGAL NOTICE:  Christian Yoder and Steve Hall (hereinafter ""we"" or ""our"" or ""us"" ) intend to pay for the food (which will probably, but not necessarily, be pizza and salad) with post-petition Chapter 11 salary dollars that have already cleared our respective individual bank accounts and, therefore, by joining us in the meal (""Lunch"") you will not be exposed to any retroactive claw-back risk by way of the Cash Account Committee.  We are also investigating the possibility of providing a limited quantity of a certain kind of beverage (""Beer"") under a provisional waiver of the defunct pre-petition Company's drinking policies, subject to approval by the Estate's Liquor Control Board which is being sought on an expedited basis.       

We feel like making this modest holiday gesture for several reasons: 

1.  It has been a pleasure working with you all during the past year.
2.  We are optimistic about this office's prospects in the upcoming year.
3.  American Express forgot to cancel our Corporate Cards.

We hope you will join us for a free lunch as we look forward to a prosperous New Year.

Until we are able to obtain company-sponsored credit cards, when incurring company expenses it will be necessary to use personal credit cards or cash, which can then be submitted for reimbursement through the expense report system.   You may want to refrain from incurring any reimbursable expenses until we receive further assurances from the company that they have the processes in place to pay them.  As information becomes available about administrative operations, I will relay it to you.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

HR is wishing you a Happy Friday! 

We've got some little treats by our desk area...

Stop by to say ""hello"" (and grab a chipper)!",,,
612,"
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.",,$1 billion an additional $200 million $3 billion more than $1 billion,JPMorgan JPMorgan Chase & Co. Salomon Smith Barney Citigroup Inc. Our Northern Natural Gas Company Transwestern Pipeline Company Houston Chronicle Enron Enron Updates
613,"During the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we=
 are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor buil=
d out given the state of the company today.  We appreciate people's concern=
s about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be redu=
cing unnecessary expenses.  Let us begin by saying that we share these conc=
erns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditu=
res without a great deal of thought.  We would also encourage people to tal=
k to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing=
 certain things.  In short, we have decided to continue with the college re=
cruiting, although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire. =
 We have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple=
 of weeks.

Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting?
During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a p=
resence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading=
 schools in the northwest.  This past year we finally reached critical mass=
 and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts.  Although we are unc=
ertain about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best lon=
g term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the north=
west.  We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at mo=
st schools.  We have identified the best people from each school and have a=
lready made plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays.  =
The cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit =
that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as pa=
rticipants in their on-campus recruiting programs.  We also realize that it=
 is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job.  It is our be=
lief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities=
 of employment may be somewhat diminished.  Finally, we would like to empha=
size the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody.  We will i=
nterview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions ba=
sed on the needs of the office.  Before extending offers we will consider t=
he potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron e=
mployees in other offices who have been redeployed.  Stated another way, we=
 don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enro=
n who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people alread=
y here at risk.  We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are mor=
e certain about the state of affairs in the company.

How Will the Floor Move Play Out?
We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks.  While we =
still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause fo=
r a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money o=
n this.  When talking to the build out team today it became clear that dela=
ying would accomplish several goals.  First, it allows us to get final arch=
itectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can mo=
re precisely peg down the costs before moving forward.  Second, it gives th=
e build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move=
.  Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes=
 sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right n=
ow.  While we still think that we are going to move forward with this proje=
ct, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do=
 right now.  In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team w=
ith firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, o=
r delay again. =20

As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, rel=
iable information becomes available.  We recognize that this is a very hard=
 time for everyone.  Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep=
 up the success of this office.

The trouble with having two computers is that I have the same things on both
of them, but I forgot to move my updated Blue Chip list over to the one I
used to send today's newsletter. That is an outdated list. Sorry about that.
You can discard that list because it is about two or three weeks old. The
list below is the bona fide, up to date, real Blue Chip list:

Eric / Jeffrey - I'm going to be in Austin on Friday, and would like to stop 
by the plant around 9 am to check it out.  I'm playing phone tag with Chris

Water consumption/make-up at Austin is as follows:

Water Make-up rate from the water plant into the demin tank is 120 gpm
Water Usage Rate of the plant at full load is 234.4 gpm

Therefor, when the plant is not running, the tank (300,000 gallon capacity) 
is filled at the rate of 120 gpm;
when the plant is running flat out, the net drawdown on the tank is 114.4 gpm 
(234.4-120=114.4).

If you do the math, if you start out Monday morning at 6 am and run the plant 
for 5 days a week for 15 hours a day, then come Friday evening at 9 pm, there 
will
be 44,400 gallons in the tank.  It will then take you 35.5 hours to fill the 
tank again which is Sunday at 8:30 am.  If you do the math, you could 
potentially run the plant for a full 15 hours on Saturday, but at the end of 
the day you would only have 6,240 gallons left in the tank and you could not 
fill it in time for Monday morning.

GE's performance program states that the LM6000 without water injection has a 
NOx level of about 200 ppm.  Our SCR reduces NOx about 80% (down to 5 ppm) 
WITH water injection.  WIthout water injection and starting at 200 ppm the 
SCR is probably not going to give you 80% effectiveness, but it might keep us 
under the instantaneous NOx limit set out in our permit (~100 ppm).  I will 
have to do a little more research on this one.

Based on some initial calculations that we did early on, with a constant 
pipeline pressure, heat rate improves by approximately 50 btu/kwh (HHV) for 
every 10oF of drop in ambient temperature.  When we run the plant this 
summer, we can obviously get some better data.

Hope this helps,

632,"David, I have a problem with the RAC comments made on page #2 of the DASH.  
Specifically, the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the 
reader (ie) what is your opinion?  Is this a good sale or can significant 
recovery (on a risk adjusted basis) occur if we convert the sub debt and 
infuse more equity?  Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given 
the possible recovery of this sector?  

The DASH is deficient in its view of Basic's prospects given current energy 
prices.

Jeff/Dick/Ray, what are your opinions?

Independent of the desire to move on - what is the right call - I do not want 
to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring.

637,"Kevin, I am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the 
increased MW's given well known industry issues with the 501F technology.  
Further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in 
any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower 
than 90 degrees at site.  Likely the buyer will run any spread option value 
or multiple value based on 90 degree output.

I may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue 
rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the MW's at any time 
but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse.  Given that 
the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really 
get.  Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of 
Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed 
for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer.

The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost 
savings to fund their fee ($9.0M) rather than further increase to the capital 
cost of the facilities.  As well, given current accounting language, any fee 
we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized 
so I would like to find ways for this to be self financing.

My knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and 
adjust tactics with EECC as necessary.

I do remember working on an assignment agreement regarding the assignment of 
the Columbia Energy contracts with MSCGI  to Enron North America Corp.  I 
will need to find the document.

It is my understanding that, with the exception of one deal, all the deals 
between ENA and MSCGI are firm deals of greater than one month duration.  ENA 
uses the GISB for month or less firm deals and interruptible deals of any 
length as recommended by the Gas Industry Standards Board.  For firm deals 
that are longer than one month, ENA uses a master firm agreement if one 
exists.  If there is no master firm agreement, we send out our General Terms 
and Conditions with our confirmation.  That answers your question of why 
Ellen sent our GTC when there is a GISB in place.

It appears to me that you and I need to work on getting a master firm 
agreement in place.  Please let me know your thoughts.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

OIL PRODUCTS
Congratulations to the US Oil Products Trading Team!  On October 4, 2000 th=
ey=20
successfully completed a deal with a volume of 2,400,000 barrels with a=20
Notional Value of $80,640,000.  This is the highest Notional Value associat=

with an EOL trade.

Kudos again for another great deal. They have done another large=20

STEEL

product.  The contract has been drafted and is currently being discussed wi=
th=20
customers.

Financial Hot Rolled Steel will be posted on EnronOnline, allowing the stee=
l=20

and smooth cash flow.  Over time, forward price curves with transparent=20
pricing should allow the steel industry to also benefit from improved acces=

The next challenge will be to educate the steel industry about financial=20
swaps and derivatives as risk management tools.  The $300 billion steel=20
market should provide an excellent growth opportunity for Enron.

762,"Howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in Volume 
Management's initials in OSS.  I need some information for Daren before it 
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for 
11/97 forward.

I've done some research as follows:

1/95 shows delivery on transport contract #012-82269-02-002 (Southeastern 
Marketing Co. as counterparty)

1/96 thru 10/31/97 shows delivery on transport contract #012-27182-02-001 
(Esperanza Marketing Corp as counterparty).

11/97 thru 12/97 shows delivery on 089-41500-102

1/98 shows delivery on  089-41500-101

No other transactions at this meter since 1/98.

Some questions I need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport 
contracts through 10/31/97 and then started to be allocated to the 089 
contract later?  Are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to 
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used?   Or should the transport 
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11/97 forward?  Each 
item indicates a delivered volume, so either a transport  or sale is taking 
place.  

All the information that is supplied on the UA4 report is need a contract for 
9,448 MMBTU.

Since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it 
was assigned to me, it's difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used 
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in 
CPR or OSS.

786,"Changing counterparty names on Sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact 
to any downstream processes.  

I hope the following will give more clarification.   

Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail! 

Thanks,
dg  3-9517


Sitara / Unify - Process
* Scenario - Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had 
been pathed, scheduled & bridged back from Unify.
* Impact - zero impact to Logistics & Volume Management, absolutely 
harmless.  Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues.
* Process - 
Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B.   
Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline.  
The new name (ctprty B) does bridge over to Unify.
Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify (gui display does not change)
Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify.  The field is now 
highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (gui display changes only at high 
level, not on path)
The Scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re-path
If re-pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path

Unify pushes back the deal number & meter to Sitara (not ctprty info)
Balancing works on deal number & meter only (not ctprty info)
The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara (where all 
information is correct)
Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tie-out.  
(all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match 
up perfectly)
Settlements utilizes information in Unify.  
Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which 
would create two notification entries
If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re-draft would occur.
(note:  there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now)


Autonoms ""Tom's words of warning"" - 
Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after 
deals were pathed and nominated.  Basically it would change a key on an EDI 
path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already 
nominated to the pipeline.  If the scheduler re-nominated, data at the 
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct 
the problem.  In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to 
manually cut the original nominated volume.  This is not an issue with Unify 
(as explained above).

819,"Gentlemen,

In considering the solution about the Plant index number recorded in most of 
the Visupro tables I have discovered one issue we will have by not having 
this on the SQL server.  Since the Plant index number records the sequence by 
turbine, we can use this to detect when gaps in the data occur.  In 
particular, in the Errdev we expect a consecutive Plant index number for each 
turbine ID and status message.  

If we push the data to the SQL server and create an auto number, the status 
messages for each turbine will have a sequential auto number, but NOT be 
consecutive.  Using the Plant Index number has become a very useful field in 
analysis of the Errdev data.

We need to store the Plant Index as it is written.

Comments?

821,"Executive Summary
Marion Horna and Kurt Anderson requested an explanation of how the EW 1.5 
Availability was computed.  In addition,  Barry Riffe and Jeff Duff have 
expressed concerns that there is confusion between the EW 750 owners, I.E., 
and EWC on how to categorize (OOH, UAH, or other) the direction curtailment & 
windshear curtailment for availability computations.   The attached memo is 
the result of a throrough review of the Exhibits in the 1.5 contracts that 
define availability and the UAH & OOH clauses which are similar between 1.5 
and 750 project contracts.  This memo doesn't include a thorough review of 
the Technical Specs or Germainisher Lloyd design recommendations for 1.5 
projects.  This draft memo proposes that:

 1)  EWC should not be penalized for direction curtailment and windshear 
curtailment losses to availability IF that curtailment is in accordance with 
 the Tech Spec of Germanischer Lloyd recommendations or requirements.   
Neither the UAH term or the OOH term in the contract apply.  
 The corrections applied to correct for windshear in previous EW 750 reports 
were made to compensate for the limitations of controller counters.

 2) Only those Offline Hrs ordered  by the organizations specifically 
mentioned in the OOH clause in the contract should be included in the OOH 
term in 
 the contract.  For example, if the owner is not specifically mentioned in 
the OOH clause then their orders for offline turbine should not be included in
 OOH.

The availability resulting from this computation will not penalize 
availability for all reasons that the turbine didn't produce power in good 
winds.  There will be events that prevent turbine production but do not lower 
availability, ie.  high winds, direction curtailment.

	What are the different systems that we use (SAP, ECCS, TIS, Hyperion, Tax Data Warehouse, Corptax, TKS)?
	How do I read the close schedule that the TST sends out every month?
	When are final pre-tax SAP reports available for viewing?
	What is the deadline for writing DARS rules?
	What is a topside entry?
	What posting level should I use when writing a report out of ECCS?
	And many others...

Over the past few weeks we have generated a list of which status counters are

I took that list and indexed it by counter so it show all the faults that 
actually (according to our simulation) increment a given counter. I also 
included the faults that we could not test and the counters they 
theoretically increment. 



If you have time could you please check to see that the given faults are 
incrementing the correct counters using the proper definitions of 
availability. Specifically, there are several highlighted items in the second

Europe May Need 69,000 MW by 2005; What Generation Mix Will the Continent
Use to Reach that Goal?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Demand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five
years may prompt the need for an additional 69,000 MW of generating capacity
to be built, according to a new report from Financial Times Energy. The
additional capacity includes the proposed capacity for Spain through 2004,
but also includes Finland, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
At the same time, concerns about supply and demand in Europe are being
exacerbated by Germany's plan to reduce its reliance on nuclear power.

ANALYSIS: If FT Energy's projections for necessary generation additions
in Europe are accurate, I think there are some real challenges that the
Continent will face in reaching this goal. First off, for perspective,
let's be clear on the amount of generating capacity that FT Energy is claiming
Europe will need by 2005. The figure of 69,000 MW is roughly equivalent
to the generating capacity in the state of California or the ERCOT system
in Texas. When we consider also that the United States consumes about double
the amount of power that Europe consumes, the projection that Europe will
need an additional 69,000 MW of new generating capacity is a staggering
proposition.

Granted, like other developed areas of the world, Europe's energy consumption
has grown over the last two years. According to data included in its report,
FT Energy claims that demand for power in Europe has risen from 2,409 
terrawatt-hours
(TWh) in 1998 to 2,446 TWh in 1999, an increase of about 1.5 percent per
year. While this may seem like a minimal increase, it is important to note
that in some European markets growth has exceeded that average. For instance,
estimated new capacity additions through 2005 are mainly concentrated in
Spain, France, Germany and Sweden. The growth in demand, coupled with market
liberalization, has created many opportunities in Europe for the construction
or purchase of generation assets.

Although reportedly 60 percent of the electricity market across Europe
has been liberalized to date, the Continent remains rather disjointed as
it is composed of 16 national markets that are all approaching privatization
at different speeds. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands began their
privatization movements in the early 1990s. Spain required its state-owned
utility companies to begin divesting their assets in February 1999, a process
that will continue through 2007. Germany decided to open 100 percent of
its market all at once in April 1998. And France resisted efforts to 
privatize,
and only began to liberalize its market under pressure from the European
Union. Consequently, although Europe may in fact need the 69,000 MW of
new generating capacity that FT Energy has projected, the type and extent
to which new generating capacity will be built in Europe will depend on
the energy policy of each independent nation. A variety of restrictions
may be found that will limit the opportunities to generate this huge amount
of capacity.

Each European country is developing its own policy toward privatization
and, by extension, its approach to generation development. I can't examine
the policy of each country in this forum, but I think a look at Germany
is warranted, both because it is a major component of Europe's total energy
market and because Germany poses some interesting dilemmas that will impact
the Continent as a whole.

Germany has largely been considered the crown jewel of European deregulation,
due to the fact that the totality of the German market has been opened
to competition. It follows that generation coming from Germany should 
contribute
a large percentage of the Continent's future power needs. However, a large
percentage of Germany's power has come from nuclear power, but that has
all changed over the last year. After the Social Democratic Party formed
a coalition with the antinuclear Green Party, nuclear energy became an
unacceptable energy source. The German government has essentially put a
moratorium on nuclear power, and in fact decided to eventually shut down
19 nuclear power plants in the country. Just last month, Germany's two
largest power producers, RWE AG and E.ON AG, announced plans to cut output
from their nuclear plants as a reaction to the squeeze on prices that has
developed since Germany liberalized its market. The measures amount to
a reduction of about 10 percent in Germany's overall power generating 
capacity.


Moreover, nuclear energy has generated over one-third of Germany's nearly
500 billion kilowatt-hours of annual electricity demand, and one-third
of Western Europe's total electricity supply. As the future of nuclear
power in Germany looks rather dim, big questions surround what will replace
nuclear as a power source in this country that is critical to Europe's
energy industry.

Coal currently produces about 50 percent of the power generation in Germany,
but as a result of the country's attempts to lower emissions, coal also
appears to be on a decline. Also, in Germany, as in the rest of Europe,
coal-industry subsidies will come to an end as early as 2005, making it
less economical to invest in coal-fired plants. At the same time, other
countries like France are exploring clean-coal technologies, but it is
questionable how much this production will contribute to the overall demand
across the Continent.

Generally, natural gas has been considered the ascending fuel that will
take the place of nuclear power in Europe, given the seemingly abundant
supplies of natural gas in Russia and the North Sea. However, as demand
across other continents such as Asia and Africa also increases, this may
impact the prospects of securing natural gas in Europe. In addition, there
are no effective rules across Europe for third-party access to private
pipeline grids, also putting into question the future of natural-gas supplies.
Also, as we have seen in the United States, as demand for natural gas 
increases,
so will the prices, which could impact the viability of natural gas a primary
power source.

As a result, much of the attention in Europe has turned toward renewable
energy. In fact, the German government wants to double renewable energy
output to 10 percent of total energy demand by 2010, using such forms as
hydroelectric and wind power. This seems consistent with what the rest
of Europe is doing. The United Kingdom also said that it wants to generate
10 percent of its electricity from renewable resources by 2010. Scandinavian
countries already have become predominantly based in renewable and 
low-emission
forms of energy, with hydroelectric power comprising more than half of
the Nordic region's total electricity production.

Wind power in particular is being given a great deal of attention in Western
Europe, with projects in Germany, Denmark and Spain ranking among the 
fastest-growing
in the world. Again, according to the U.S. DOE, wind power is projected
to grow by 1.9 percent per year in Western Europe. This growth prospective
is pretty dismal, and casts doubt on whether or not renewable energy will
be sufficient to meet the demand in Europe. Renewable energy works fine
when planning overall energy needs, but it rarely can be relied on to meet
peak demand. The laws of nature ensure that wind blows when it wants to
and the sun shines when it wants to, which can make peak planning based
on renewable energy difficult if not impossible. This being the case, many
critics say Europe's current move toward renewable energy is completely
unrealistic, arguing that it would take nearly 2,000 wind turbines to equal
one nuclear plant. In addition, the growth for renewable energy is plotted
over the course of ten to fifteen years. FT Energy marks the year 2005
as the point at which Europe will need the additional 69,000 MW of generating
capacity.

In addition, despite the fact that coal-fired generation poses pollution
problems, it is still a comparatively low-cost form of generation. This
will make it difficult for renewable energy sources to emerge in the absence
of a strong worldwide commitment. The U.S. Department of Energy projects
only a moderate increase in hydroelectric and other renewable forms of
energy through 2020, just enough for renewable energy sources to maintain
a slim 8-percent share of the total world energy consumption.

So what is the answer to this contradiction between the apparent need for
new generating capacity in Europe and the restrictions on power sources
that could help the Continent to reach its supply needs? First, keep in
mind that I've focused on Germany because it plays such a pivotal role
in Europe as a whole. However, the restrictions on nuclear power are not
necessarily indicative of the approach of other European countries. For
instance, the neighboring Czech Republic is embracing nuclear power by
opening a plant in Temelin. The question is, without Germany's contribution
of nuclear power, will Europe be able to derive enough capacity from other
power sources and other countries? Although the 69,000 MW goal seems very
ambitious, Europe as a whole may get closer to this goal through the use
of merchant plants. As competition continues, wholesale power buyers are
demanding shorter-term contracts, which in turn is supporting a growing
trend toward merchant plants throughout the Continent. Presently, only
the United Kingdom has moved aggressively to merchant power, but there
are signs that the trend is extending to Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
and even Germany. In addition to compensating for the move away from nuclear
power, merchant plants could also support a renewed growth of Europe's
natural-gas market. Yet, as we have seen in California, the plant siting
process offers its own array of regulatory hurdles, and it is not clear
if European governments will facilitate plant siting in various countries.
Plus, the merchant plants that are being discussed are all primarily 
natural-gas
fired, which again raises risks of relying so heavily on one power source.

Moreover, just as North America enters what could be a very volatile winter
due to our own brand of energy supply problems, we are finding that the
problem is not limited to our part of the world. It is, of course, unknown
if Europe will meet its additional supply projections of 69,000 MW by 2005.
Yet, at the same time, it is clear that demand on the Continent continues
to rise while traditional forms of power supply are on the decline.

862,"Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we ""share"" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me

Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline)
has been the only pipeline into this market.  


NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis

Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 
47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored 
by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will 
add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis 
market. 

""The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing 
strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets 
currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by 
adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,"" said Richard D. 
Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. 

The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is 
scheduled for completion in June of 2002. 

NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and 
storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, 
which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In 
addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation 
agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf 
Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. 

The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area 
that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company 
[Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, 
president of Illinois Power. ""This new connection to Illinois Power's system 
will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the 
metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point 
to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the 
area. 

""The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy 
provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,"" said Deb 
Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest 
from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season 
will determine the final scope of the project. 

""With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the 
St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of 
interest,"" said Macdonald. ""We anticipate a strong response, however, given 
the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power 
generation.""

873,"Per my conversation with Lynn and Steve on Friday night, we have claimed 
force majeure for any gas shut ins that actually happened for the 1st.  (I'm 
not sure how extensive that actually turned out to be).   Does that have any 
financial consequences or other consequences for us?  For example, on TW, 
certain force majeure situations can force us to refund demand charges, 
right?  NN's tariff doesn't have a similar mechanism, but we may have common 
law exposure.  We may need to revisit the Jan 1-4 period when we talk 
tomorrow or Wed.  This would really make Continental and possibly others mad, 
but at worst, we could put out a revised notice saying that the shut-ins for 
the 1st -4th were not FM.  Any thoughts?  DF

risk you guys will face out there:  the risk that FERC will listen to your 
presentation and conclude that the embedded optionality that some pipelines 
are currently offering in transport contracts is a negotiated term and 
condition and therefore must be stopped.  I think we need to tailor the 
presentation and filing to minimize the chance that FERC will take away 
flexibility we think we now have (i.e., the flexibility to embed shipper puts 
in transport contracts).   Even if the TW approach on unbundled options goes 
nowhere, several of the strategies we may want to implement next year depend 
on continued ability to sell embedded options.   Susan, Shelley,a nd MKM, I

FERC might squirrel and go the opposite direction we are trying to push

so far.  You don't need to be an expert on all that, but a basic 
understanding of what they have already looked at will help you be more 
responsive to what they want to ask you about.  If you do get stumped, try to 
defer the question by telling FERC you need to check on a fact or two and can 
answer that question after a break or at the end of the interview.  By doing 
that , you should be able to get them the information they need without 
having them cross examine a bunch of other people.  Inevitably, if you ask

wouldn't help us.  Northern does have a fuel tracker, however, and might 
avoid adverse earnings impact from tax volatility if we could pay those taxes

904,"Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning:

1) We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for 300 MW on oil to 
meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve 
margin.  We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above 
220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)

2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full 
time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the 
transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please 
describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal 
detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how 
long this will take.  I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the 
corrective measures.]

3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate 
220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if 
dipatched above 220 MW.

If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they 
are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas 
is ready by April 01.  We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue 
Garvin flex months.

Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition 
about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem 
is cleared.  If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced 
fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or 
seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our 
availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.  
Any data you can provide will be helpful.

EPPI Claim for 2000-2001

Enron Processing Properties, Inc (EPPI)  assignment of the GPM Agency Agreement committed EPPI to reimburse KN (now Oneok) for all-in transportation rates above 4.45%.  NNG's must bill minimum rates and those rates are sometimes above the 4.45% all-in rate, therefore Oneok has submitted invoices for transport excesses of $79,165 and $222,315 for the years 2000 and 2001.

The invoices are currently being checked by Gas Logistics and once a final determination has been made coding instructions will be needed for this EPPI commitment.


Prior Claim (1997-1999)

On 2/18/2000, KN submitted a claim for $363,211 covering 1997-1999, I checked the calculations and the claim was revised to $192,000.

During negotiations KN sold the agreements to Oneok and to my knowledge the prior claim was never paid nor were any more demands for payments made.  ",,"79,165 222,315 363,211 192,000","Enron Processing Properties, Inc KN Oneok NNG Gas Logistics"

Operational note on DPL Columbia Gas SST contract for April:

The total contract volume will decrease from 241,000 to 120,000 on April 
1st.  By the terms of the deal, Dayton will take what they need on a daily 
basis and Enron will have the remainder of the contract MDQ.

Assuming normal system demand at DPL, Enron should have from 70,000 to 95,000 
of this SST contract during the month of April.

ECONOMIC NOTE:

Enron will not have to pay any variable cost (demand or commodity) to Dayton 
until the cumulative usage of the SST contract by DPL and Enron reaches 
9,239,520 /dth.  Based on the historical data compiled by Columbia during the 
course of the asset management deal, this 9.2 dth figure  will not be hit 
until sometime in June or early July.

It is to our advantage to fill this contract up to the max. allowed by DPL on 
a daily basis until this 9.2 figure comes into play.   It is an immediate 
saving of the commodity charge, which will be about $0.015.

I can provide a copy of the actual contract for your review upon request.

Comments:
If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand 
charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.  

Questions for Tennessee;
What are the rates for October?
Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or 
monthly quantities?

Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days.  I hope we don't=
 need. =20


Events of June 3

Gas service to the plant has been challenging.  Lonestar Pipeline is runnin=
g a pig for June 4,5,&6.  Lonestar told us that roughly 60% would be cut. A=
pparently Friday, May 31, Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti=
es the maintenance information.  He also indicated that our Lonestar=09rep =
said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system =
was Lonestar-Carthage and Lonestar-Katy Plant.  Neither of the plant's supp=
liers -Apache/Cinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day =
June 4.   Cuts did occur as we were warned.  Of the total nomination of 45M=
M, 17.1 MM flowed for today's gas flow.  The supplier breakout is Apache/Ci=
nergy -20MM and  Williams-25MM.   Yesterday, Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t=
hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for today's =
flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June 5 & 6.=20

I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June 3.  I =
also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a back-up.  The plant ca=
n burn No.6 low sulfur fuel oil.  Mike indicated that the plant would not w=
ant to do that and hadn't burned oil in quite some time.  I told Mike that =
I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera=
ge with the suppliers.  He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t=
he plant.  I told him that I =09wasn't familiar with Lonestar specifically =
but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a =
plant of it's size they probably have remote control capabilities.  If not =
they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve=
.

The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language.  Th=
e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right =
to choose the supply point/points into Lonestar's system from a list of pri=
mary or secondary points in Exhibit A.  If the plant's transportation contr=
act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in=
to Lonestar's system at a location that will flow on the plant's transporta=
tion agreement.  If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig=
ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels.  Yeste=
rday, I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at=
 Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy.  T=
om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didn't have =
a copy of the amendment.   Sounds like the amendment may have changed some =
of the delivery points.  I told Tom at Cinergy that =09my primary concern w=
as flowing gas supply to the plant.  Tom was suggesting that this may be a =
force majuere event.  I told him I didn't interpret=09the force majuere lan=
guage that way.  The force majuere language addresses freeze-offs and line =
breaks but not maintenance.  I also told him that the contract has a provis=
ion for transportation interruption. =20

In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op=
erational issues and not monetary issues.  I told him we could address the =
=09financial resolution per the contract after the event was over.  I told =
him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min=
imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th=
e pipe cutting back their gas supply.=20

   =20
Events of June 4

This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy.  They are supplying 1=
2.9MM at Aquila-Katy into Lonestar for June 5.  Williams is buying 10MM at =
Carthage and 5MM at HLPL for June 5.  Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju=
ne 5.  Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June 4 =
after the pigging was completed.  They will  pay back the volume ratably fo=
r the remainder or in a day. =20

Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around 12:30 to say the plant needed=
 to cut back to the 17.1MM flowing gas volume for today.  The plant's burn =
rate was causing the pig to run to fast.  Russ is the manager of the transp=
ortation administration department at Lonestar.  I called Russ back at 1:10=
pm to inquire about the problem.  I asked him to call gas control and see w=
hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could=
 bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem.   I also called Mike =
to inform him of the new events.  Russ called back and said the run would b=
e over at 12:00pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul=
d help was El Paso Field Services-Ennis.  He also indicated that the pressu=
re had stabilized and the plant may be able
to make it through the run without the incremental gas.  I called Cinergy a=
nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point. =
 Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou=
ld let me know.  At 3:30 Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and=
 the cost would be $0.95 to $1.00 more than the contract price.  She said t=
hat they didn't think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested=
 meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract.  They would buy =
the gas if we would agree to pay the price.  I called Mike at White Pines a=
nd ask him what he wanted to do.  He indicated that he wanted us me to buy =
the gas.  I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n=
om.  Russ said the plant was burning more.  Now they were burning 48MM and =
requested they cut back to their nominated volume of 45MM.  I told Russ I d=
idn't think that they could be I would call.  Mike confirmed that they coul=
d not.  He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve=
n 20 to 30 MW.  He said Brazos is ""playing chicken"" and are requesting ever=
ything they have.   I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get =
them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co=
ntract after the pigging event is completed.  I called Michelle with my pro=
posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back.  We=
 agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after =
the event was over.  Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com=
e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered.=
 =20

Events of June 5

The plant made it through the June 4 gas day on gas.  I spoke with Michelle=
 and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June 6 the sa=
me as June 5.  She said that Apache didn't think they were liable to make u=
p the gas they shorted us for June 4.  She said I could talk with Pat Green=
 at Apache regarding the issue.  Williams moved their gas from Carthage to =
HPL for June 6.  I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin=
t.  I requested that =09Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact.  Neith=
er of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparti=
es.  We will have to address the =09issue intraday if necessary.
=09
I will keep everyone posted of any new developments.

I kind of doubt that you'll get any changes since both of the wells have changed in just the last two days, but here's the scoop.

There are only two wells to worry about getting calls from.  

1)  West Cam 310/313 (Hios) you may here from Elma with Forest regarding a change.  She called today with a change for the 7th to go from 3795 to 3700.  I'm going to go ahead and let Steve Lewis at Petrocom know, so you shouldn't have to worry about it unless she calls back.  I did however, give your number to her.  Her number is 337-265-2622.

2)  EI 57 (Trco) you may hear from Janine with Samedan.  She just just her volume for today's flow, so I doubt that you'll get any new changes.  The current flow is at 1400.  Janine's number is 580-221-1200.

The Tallahassee deal still has value so we want the Dominion deal to stay in place.  I'm concerned about the 1st because all the money needs to be wired tomorrow.  At this point, I believe Dominion should supply the gas for April at the contract price regardless.

958,"New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market 
customers.  In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our 
relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.  Below 
are the observations  that I have.  I would like to get you feedback on 
these.  If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.

1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.  As such, we will 
only interpret the language of the agreement related to ""existing markets"" as 
applying to only those twelve markets.  For other markets that we conduct 
business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load 
management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the 
agreement.  In essence, we see the supply management agreement being 
bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer.

2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for 
capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.  This would 
include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.  In 
addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.  It would also 
include the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990, 
64939, 65418, 62164.  There are some capacity agreements on TCO for 
CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and 
mass markets.  It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the 
demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase 
commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .  All 
un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I 
agreements.

3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity 
that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 2001.  I 
want to keep this capacity separate and under our control.  I will need your 
viewpoint on this.  If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity 
under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our 
ability to market any excess capacity in open market.  Bottom-line, I want to 
avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for 
un-utilized capacity. 

4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause.  
My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar 
nature and service level. (supply management)  To the degree that New Power 
chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only 
transactions would not be subject to this clause.    

I know you will need to review the contract.  We have some time to discuss 
these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next 
Friday, if at all possible.  I can be reached at ext 39475.  Thanks for your 
help.

This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment

268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the

268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject

967,"The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.

1)  This guy acted like he knew me and of course I was embarrassed so I acted like I knew him, AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER TALKING TO THIS GUY.  He knew that I had gone to EES and that was back in 1997-1998.

2)  Sempra told Kevin that we would get more value if we let someone change the points.  I wonder, even though we might get billed max rate, would it be possible to allow the replacement shipper to change the points for ""the term of the release only AND the releasing shipper would be billed more that max rate"" and that way the capacity would go back to its original contract points in October.

The March invoice is for demand charges of $.10 x 310,000 dth per day, which may be incorrect.  Its possible that the volume should be 310,000 dth per MONTH.

No changes made to Sitara ticket since 5/4/01.  Per Master Letter Log - ENA cancelled the financial agreement due to Central's failure to pay.  No reference is made to the physical deal.  Per Sitara - this deal has a min and max volume.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $.425 x 10,000 dth per day.

889014		Colorado Spring Utilities				96062701

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:

You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.

Tuesday November 13, 2001

*** Current pattern should hold through the five day period. I will now buy
a significant pattern change in the 6-10 day period with near unanimous
model support.***

     Most of the country remains very quiet (and very mild) in terms of
sensible weather. There are a few areas of highlight however. The system
that brought rain to California yesterday is weaker today and will break up
somewhat is it goes through the Southern Rockies. It may still emerge as a
moisture producer for West Texas. The last of the chill will be exiting the
Northeast today as winds turn more towards the SW bringing the center of
the nation warmth in. Five day temperatures will still have to be
considered as above average for most of the country.

 After more than a week of delays, it looks like we can finally hone in
with some detail to the change in the weather pattern. I still have some
question as to the degree of arctic air involved and how far South it can
go. Where I am very confident though is we will sweep away the widespread
60 and 70 degree temperatures Thanksgiving week. Changes in the Pacific
should show up in North America in about a week. The current zonal flow in
the jet will amplify allowing a full latitude ridge to build up and into
the Canadian Rockies. Downstream then, the jet comes in from the NW carving
out a trough. The most severe case comes from the Canadian models which
spin up quite the storm for Thanksgiving. It has some support from its
ensembles. The others are less aggressive, but certainly sharply colder.
Going from double digit above to double digit below normal will be a
dramatic change for sure. The continental divide will likely be the cutoff
for how West this air goes. As for timing, I would look for the Plains on
Tuesday of Thanksgiving week getting to the East Coast on Friday.

For the period Tuesday November 13 through Saturday November 17, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Southeast, Mid-Atlantic ?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Northeast, Gulf Coast, California,
Pacific NW?

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Ohio and Mississippi
Valleys, Southern Rockies and Plains, Intermountain West?

Average 7 to 12-degrees above normal: Northern and Central Rockies and
Plains?

Today's Riddle is -


A rich man's son was kidnapped. The ransom note told him to bring
a valuable diamond to a phone booth in the middle of a public park.
Plainclothes police officers surrounded the park, intending to follow
the criminal or his messenger. The rich man arrived at the phone booth
and followed instructions but the police were powerless to prevent
the diamond from leaving the park and reaching the crafty villain.
What did he do?

The answer to today's Riddle is -

This is a true story from Taiwan. When the rich man reached the phone
booth he found a carrier pigeon in a cage. It had a message attached
telling the man to put the diamond in a small bag which was around the
pigeon's neck and to release the bird. When the man did this the police
were powerless to follow the bird as  it returned across the city to
its owner.

proposal discusses a maximum sales price of $150.    Any sale made in excess

The proposal is unclear when this requirement would be in effect.   We will 
provide more information as it becomes available.

Until that time,  do not submit bids to SELL for greater than $150.   This

I am of the opinion that if we buy from LA for $225 then we should be able to 
justify bidding in to California at  > $225.   However,   we would still have

1101,"Just wanted to make sure you saw this from Les Rawson concerning Grays Harbor 
and Willamette.
-Bill

Beginning immediately Enron has purchased Control Area Reserves service from 
BPA. 

The allows Services to sell Unit contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA 
is suppling reserves for up to 60 Minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT 
of a unit derate or outage RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and make 
the reduction in the schedule during the next ramp. For example should Grays 
unit trip as 1333 RT would notify BPA and the sink that across the top of the 
hour for 1400 the schedule would be taken to zero for HE 1400. The bottom 
line is that 60 minutes is the maximum time BPA will carry the schedule.

Send me a e-mail concerning any reductions for Grays since the energy would 
need to be repaid back within 168 hours.

Also, for May Services sold 10 mw of UC energy to EWEB from Willamette all 
hours. As part of this sale Services bought 18 Mw of firm transmission from 
PACW to BPAT for all hours. 10Mw of this purchase will be used for the 
monthly sale with the remaining 8Mw used for day ahead and hourly sales. The 
Assignment Reference # 139990. The cost for this transmission is $2.72 per 
hour vs the $5.84 we normally pay for hourly non-firm so hopefully we can 
save some money on PAC transmission.

Also, beginning May 1 Services purchased Ancillary Services from PacifiCorp 
to allow Willamette's Unit Contingent energy to be sold as 1-hour firm with 
reserves. The procedure for dealing with inner hour cuts is similar to Grays 
with the exception of not calling PAC RT dispatch. Simply cut or reduce the 
schedule at the next ramp and note the derate in a e-mail to Services. This 
service adds .43 cents per Mw to the term sale costs. However, this service 
applies to Willamette's sales up to 30Mw.

Let me know if there are questions.

A few updates:

We hope to file the petition on Monday in the Bombay High Court seeking a 
ruling that the MERC does not have jurisdiction over the PPA and the current 
disputes between MSEB and Dabhol Power Company.

The Dabhol lenders have planned 3 days of meetings in Singapore this coming 
week and we will attend these meetings.  Our lenders seem to be increasingly 
nervous.  They may try to cure the construction contract defaults (over $30 
million would be required in mid-June).  While we do not relish having the 
construction contracts fall away, we do not believe that funding is prudent 
at this point.  MSEB has torn up the PPA and stated that it will not 
cooperate with Phase II power station testing, the only real remaining 
function under the power plant construction contract.

A few insolvency/creditors' rights lawyers from Skadden will be here on 
Wednesday to discuss Dabhol creditor remedies and possible DPC defenses (both 
in India and the U.S.).  A lawyer from Susman Godfrey is scheduled to join us 
at that meeting.

Unwind the PML transaction and assume that  you can do what was proposed in

assume the full tax shield value of the unwind in earnings this year as there 
would never be a tax liability in future years from the potential hedge 
income.....This 1)allows ECC to mix it up a little in terms of what we are 
doing to mitigate taxes and 2)lets you capture the value of the unwind now

MD Anderson's potential interest in employing laid off Enron employees came to our attention via Anne Marie Giltrop of MD Anderson who spoke with Angela Davis.  This morning, I spoke with Ms. Giltrop.  In light of our policy of only providing neutral references and other liability considerations, I stated that I did not believe we would provide MD Anderson a list of employees who were laid off, but that I would try to find an approved vehicle for getting information regarding job openings at MD Anderson to our former employees.  The MD Anderson web site does not reflect all current open positions, so I suggested that, if approved on both ends, MD Anderson could provide a list of openings with job descriptions that could be made available to former Enron employees.  Ms. Giltrop is attempting to obtain appropriate approval from MD Anderson.  She later phoned to inform me that I should expect to hear more from Deborah Manning, Jim Dorn, or Martha Jones.  

On our end, I have contacted David Oxley who put me in touch with Cindy Olson.  Sarah Davis will now handle coordinating relations with MD Anderson.  This is an important opportunity for former employees, and for Enron and MD Anderson as good Houston citizens.  Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).

 

The brochure for the Electricity Risk Management 101 Workshop and the Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference can be obtained by clicking on the link below:

Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference

Feb. 5-8, 2002, Miami, Florida

OVERVIEW

 

This conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO initiatives.  The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.

Energy Company Values Sink
In Response to Changing Times=20



By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President=20


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/rbellrgb100border.jpg>

Constellation Energy's (NYSE:CEG) shares fell nearly 11 percent on Friday i=
n response to announcements that the company is cutting its earnings' proje=
ctions, shelving plans to split the company into two parts, and severing it=
s ties with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which would have been a=
 minority partner in its energy-trading operation if the spin-off had gone =
ahead.=20

Analysis: Constellation Energy's stock value dropped to its lowest level in=
 seven years-down nearly 11 percent in one day, and down over 45 percent si=
nce May 1, 2001. But perhaps what is most important about Constellation is =
its shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the week=
 to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts. E=
arlier in the week Allegheny Energy (NYSE:AYE) announced it would hold off =
on its planned initial public offering (IPO) of Allegheny Energy Supply Com=
pany, its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary, until market=
 conditions improve.=20

The dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same for=
ces. Constellation sited falling energy prices, the changing nature of the =
California power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons fo=
r dropping its company-separation plans. The company said it would now focu=
s on using its ""single"" status to leverage its balance sheet to participate=
 in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United S=
tates. ""What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that co=
mes from being a single company ? What has changed (in the last one year) i=
s the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for new=
 power plants ? the reasons are simple and profound. The world has changed,=
'' Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a conference =
call with the media.=20

The change in Constellation's strategy will be costly. The company will pay=
 Goldman Sachs about $355 million to terminate their power-marketing agreem=
ent, $159 million which Goldman had previously put in the business, and $19=
6 million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business conti=
nued. Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will cau=
se the company to record a $200-million special expense in the fourth quart=
er. The company said that its split-up with Goldman Sachs was amicable. Gol=
dman's relationship with Constellation started in the mid-nineties when the=
 investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the energy=
 trading and marketing business. In 1999 Goldman agreed it would take a 17.=
5-percent stake in Constellation's trading business when the state of Maryl=
and deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a sepa=
rate trading company. Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want to be =
part of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain togeth=
er.

It certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other=
 significant announcements concerning its future plans. Mayo A. Shattuck II=
I was elected to the position of president and CEO effective Nov. 1, 2001. =
Shattuck recently resigned his position as chairman and CEO of Deutsche Ban=
c. Alex Brown and has served on Constellation's board of directors for the =
past seven years. On Oct. 24, the New York Public Service Commission said i=
t would approve the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating s=
tation in New York to Constellation Nuclear for $780 million. Constellation=
 Nuclear is a unit of the Constellation Energy Group. As part of the sale, =
Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of Nine Mile's output at fixed =
prices for 10 years, or through August 2009 if the operating license of Nin=
e Mile 1 is not extended.=20

The unregulated generation and trading activities continue to drive the bul=
k of earnings for both Constellation and Allegheny. Constellation's domesti=
c merchant energy business contributed $0.89 of their $1.00 earnings per sh=
are of common stock for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2001, slightly higher =
than last year when the business contributed $0.87 of the $0.98 per share i=
n earnings for the same quarter. Allegheny Energy reported that their third=
-quarter profits more than doubled on increased generation capacity and the=
 acquisition of a trading and marketing unit. Allegheny's third-quarter ear=
nings were $1.33 per share, compared with $0.69 per share one year ago, and=
 beating analysts' earnings of $1.10 to $1.28 per share. Allegheny is confi=
dent that its year-end earnings will be within its guidance range of $3.80 =
to $4.10 per share.=20

Despite the strong earnings, Allegheny's stock price has dropped over 30 pe=
rcent since May, and over 5 percent in the past 10 trading days. The drop i=
n energy stock value appears to be driven by softening wholesale power pric=
es. Earlier in the month Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate of Allegheny'=
s 2002 earnings by 12 cents, to $4.03, citing reduced forward power price a=
ssumptions.=20

The high-flying days of the recent past, where energy companies' price-to-e=
arnings (P/E) multiples were exceeding 50 in certain cases, appear to be ov=
er. Many power producers are returning to their roots-scrapping plans for s=
plitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations =
can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy and soften=
ing wholesale market prices. Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amr=
o, said there are common themes affecting the industry: ""One is lower power=
 prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower sto=
ck prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth.""=20

AES Corp. (NYSE:AES ), apparently agrees. Its earnings fell for a second co=
nsecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain and=
 said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out s=
elling off assets. AES' Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AES =
was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term c=
ontract generation business. By placing generating capacity into long-term =
contracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of fla=
t growth. Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets were =
very low, allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for their p=
roduct. But with the slowing economy, mild weather and consumer response to=
 the higher prices, power demand for 2001 is flat or even down from one yea=
r ago in many parts of the country.=20

The recent actions of Constellation, Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fu=
ndamental shift in the electric business. Their actions are, in some respec=
ts, a return to the past-companies striving for predictability and reliabil=
ity in their power supply costs, profits and operations. Perhaps most signi=
ficantly, companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to w=
hether or not they will continue to be an integrated business. As Constella=
tion concluded, one way to achieve and maintain a critical mass of business=
 is to remain an integrated company. We would not be surprised if others co=
me to the same conclusion.=20

=09=09=09=20
=09=09=09
=09=09=09In our previous  Littler E-Lert,  ""Emerging Trends: Less Pretrial =
Dismissals=20
of Employment Suits  and More Trials,"" we discussed the likelihood that=20
federal  courts will be more inclined to let juries decide employment =20
discrimination cases. Based on a recent Texas Supreme Court  case, Quantum=
=20
Chemical Corp. v. Toennies, Texas  employers should anticipate the same tre=
nd=20
in employment cases  arising under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act=
=20
(TCHRA)  in Texas state courts.=20
=09=09=09
=09=09=09Ralf Toennies worked  for Quantum Chemical as an engineer. A few m=
onths after=20
he  began to report to a new supervisor, his performance reviews  changed=
=20
from being satisfactory to ""below expectations."" After  Quantum fired=20
Toennies for poor performance, Toennies sued  Quantum, alleging that he was=
=20
the victim of age  discrimination. At trial (where the jury found no =20
discrimination), Toennies did not introduce any direct  evidence of age=20
discrimination. Instead, he attempted to prove  discrimination by=20
establishing that the employer=01,s reason for  his termination - poor=20
performance - was false or a pretext  for discrimination. Some of the=20
co-workers called to testify  at trial stated that Toennies was ""diligent""=
=20
and ""very  competent."" The Texas Supreme Court held that this testimony  an=
d=20
his prior satisfactory performance appraisals, which  contradicted the=20
employer=01,s explanation that Toennies was a  poor performer, was enough t=
o=20
""permit the trier of fact to  find that the employer was actually motivated=
=20
by  discrimination."" The Court remanded the case for  another trial with a=
=20
new set of jury instructions to assess  whether the employer's decision was=
=20
motivated by Toennies'  age.
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09In its analysis of  the case, the Court held that the question the=
 jury=20
should  answer is whether the plaintiff=01,s protected status - age,  race,=
 sex,=20
etc. - ""was a motivating factor"" for the employment  decision. The=20
plaintiff-employee does not have to prove that  his or her protected status=
=20
was the ""sole"" factor or the  ""determining"" factor in the decision; instead=
,=20
if the jury  determines that the protected status ""was a motivating  factor=
,""=20
then the jury may decide that the plaintiff was the  victim of illegal=20
discrimination.=20
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09While this merely may  seem to be only a difference in verbiage, t=
he shift=20
is  significant. The ""motivating factor"" standard is much  different than=
=20
proving that ""but for"" the protected status,  the employer would not have=
=20
fired the employee. The practical  effect of the Court's decision is to=20
increase the burden on  the employer to show that it would have made the=20
adverse  employment decision regardless of the employee's protected  status=
.=20
This decision will make summary judgment in an  employment case even more=
=20
difficult to obtain in state court.  Even if a supervisor does not have an=
=20
illegal motive for the  termination, if there is a scintilla of evidence th=
at=20
casts  doubt on the reason why the employee was terminated, the  employer=
=01,s=20
fate may be in the hands of the jury.=20
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09Accordingly,  before making a termination or other adverse employm=
ent =20
decision, we recommend  that employers?perform an exit interview with two=
=20
persons  (other than the supervisor) present to ascertain if the  employee=
=20
has any discrimination concerns. Consider having the  employee sign an=20
acknowledgment documenting the topics  discussed in the exit interview. If=
=20
the employee alleges  disparate treatment, the termination should be put on=
 =20
administrative hold until the issues have been investigated.  The employee=
=20
need not be reinstated, but the termination  should not be made final until=
=20
the investigation is completed.  Review termination decisions with counsel,=
=20
if necessary, to  assess the litigation risks.? Finally, implement =20
procedures to prevent hasty, unauthorized termination  decisions.
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09In addition to  preventive measures, employers should also examine=
 all =20
pleadings, affirmative defenses, and jury charges in pending  TCHRA cases t=
o=20
be certain that it has raised all defensive  theories. For example, an=20
employer may reduce damages if the  employer can establish that it would ha=
ve=20
made the same  adverse employment decision regardless of the employee's =20
protected status. Each lawsuit should be reviewed on  case-by-case basis to=
=20
determine whether to raise that defense. =20

If you enjoy receiving our free, daily IssueAlert, then we are sure that you 
will truly benefit from SCIENTECH's two new information sources: 

Generation IssueAlert
Emerging Technology IssueAlert 

Following the same successful format of the daily SCIENTECH IssueAlert, which 
will still be distributed via e-mail every day, the Generation IssueAlert and 
Emerging Technology IssueAlert will be delivered to you on Monday, Wednesday 
and Friday. 

The Generation IssueAlert focuses exclusively on issues related to the 
generation business within the energy industry. Issues that may be covered in 
the Generation IssueAlert include power supply, reliability, distributed 
generation, wholesale trading, developments in fuel supply (coal, natural 
gas, nuclear, renewables), and new competitive markets. 

The Emerging Technology IssueAlert focuses on new technologies that are 
emerging within the energy industry. This wide-ranging column covers 
information technology, new IPOs and investments, power supply technologies 
(e.g., fuel cells), billing software, energy management software, 
transmission services (RTOs), and new start-up companies. 

Both the Generation IssueAlert and the Emerging Technology IssueAlert are 
subscription-based publications. Generation IssueAlert costs $495 for a 
one-year subscription. The New Technology IssueAlert is $695 for a one-year 
subscription.  And you can get both Issue Alerts for $895, a 25% savings.  

Just like our daily SCIENTECH IssueAlert, the new Generation IssueAlert and 
Emerging Technology IssueAlert will be delivered directly to your e-mail 
address in an easy-to-read HTML format. 

Don't miss this opportunity to subscribe to the new Generation IssueAlert and 
Emerging Technology IssueAlert. As our successful daily SCIENTECH IssueAlert

one business sector that is most important to you--providing the analysis 
that you need to maintain continued success in your business.

Your list does not appear to address the issue of RTO liability for
costs caused by issuance of invalid operating instructions.  This issue
is very important to the parties (generators and Scheduling
Coordinators) who will be obligated to comply with the RTO Tariff.

I've raised this issue several times now at RRG meetings, but it
apparently has not yet taken hold at the Legal Work Group.

I have not been able to raise the issue at the meetings of your subgroup
because of conflicts with other NWRTO meetings, and I will not be able
to attend your future subgroup meeting (again, due to conflicts with
other NWRTO meetings), so I've attempted to frame the issue through the
attached, hastily-drafted issue paper.

Please contact me if you need additional explanation of the concerns
stated in the paper.

Thanks,

2.  BPA and other public agencies' authority and ability to indemnify.

3.  Liability for environmental matters.

4.  D and O insurance for members of the RTO board.

5.  Insurance for RTO employees, workers compensation, employee benefit

7.   Claims administration.

8.   Congestion management--potential liability for cutting schedules

9.   Force majeure.

10.  Liability for preexisting conditions.

12.   E and O insurance, depending on the services the RTO will

1174,"Just a reminder that interventions and comments in this proceeding are due 
next Monday, March 19th.  This case concerns a complaint filed by Tuscon 
Electric challenging Governor Davis' and the state of California's 
commandeering of the BFM contracts of SCE and PG&E.  The complaint argues 
that the contracts belong to interstate markets and are beyond the reach of 
the state's eminent domain powers.

While the complaint is consistent with arguments that we have made in the 
past on many issues, I am not clear whether, on a commercial level, EPMI is 
upset that the Governor commandeered the contracts.  My surface analysis is 
that the state is unlikely to pay fair value for the contracts and thus, if 
this is the only consideration, we would be better off if the contracts are 
returned to the PX to use as collateral on SCE's and PG&E's defaults (thereby 
mitigating chargeback exposure).  I am not in position, however, to evaluate 
whether EPMI sees a commercial advantage in buying these contracts from DWR 
as opposed to buying them back from the PX under the liquidation procedures 
announced by the PX before the contracts were commandeered.  FYI, the PX's 
procedures gave counterparties (such as EPMI) first opportunity to buy the 
contracts; when SCE protested this method, we intervened in support of the 
PX's proposal.

We have three courses of action:  (1) file a plain vanilla intervention; (2) 
intervene and file short comments in support of the complaint; or (3) do 
nothing.  Since interventions and comments are due on Monday, please advise 
as soon as possible which course you prefer.  I am available in my office

and my ears perked up.  Whatever happened to the presumption of innocence?
Especially someone of David's standing who, as far as I know, has never been
in trouble?  You know what?  I haven't always agreed with Cindy on her
issues, but in this instance I'd sue for all I could!  That is just awful
and Monroe should be ashamed of himself.  Who the h..l does he think he is?
When Sheriff Otter was in office (and others too) the citizens of Chambers
County felt safe because you knew you were being protected by them, now you
want to know who's watching the Sheriff so the citizens can feel safe.  What
a mess!  This just goes to show what a little power can do to some people.

The tops to our kitchen cabinets and island are no more.  They demolished
all of that yesterday.  Robyn was so cute, 'cause she jumps up to the sink
for water and last night when she did, she almost fell into the hole.  She
can't figure it out--doesn't know what happened to her faucet!  It's
supposed to take 1-2 weeks to complete the granite; the painters are about
1/2 way?, I'm scheduled to have the carpet installed Wed., 10/31, and then
they have to do the floors.  We figure another 3-4 weeks before it's all
finished.

Friday when we got home it looked like the painters had put everything back
for the weekend, so Saturday I put a load of clothes on to wash and went
upstairs.  You guessed it!  The machine wasn't hooked up--water everywhere
downstairs.  I almost started crying.  I asked Marie what we had done that
was so bad that we were continuously being punished.  Anyway, it was just
one load of water, so we got it up.  Our contractor did send a guy over and
he came also.  He is really good--always available to you!

I have attached a revised agreement (""Acknowledgement"") and schedule that should be used with respect to those master credit netting agreements that involve both Enron Canada Corp.and ENA.  Rather than doing a separate Acknowledgement for each different credit netting agreement, I think we should be o.k. entering into one global agreement between ENA and ECC and merely updating the attached schedule (Marie is keeping me updated as we add additional counterparties).

that
you are INVITED and we wish with all our hearts that you could be here.

As far as how long before we are in the house...well that depends on the 
market,
you have to remember that I am paying for all of the personal part of our
building with MY money.  The house will be 100% paid for, that's the German 
way.
 Yeah, that makes me sick but that's how it is...so I think we are looking at 
an
end of March move in...time and money will tell.  All of the big costs will be
covered by the end of the year, the only thing left is the finishing stuff,
marble, tile, wood floors, stairs, paint, wallpaper...hopefully only a few
hundred thousand more of cash, hopefully!

I Just left the building and I LOVE IT!  They put the windows in the office,
workers break room, warehouse, and our personal garage...I love them, and 
that's
a great relief, I had NO idea how they were going to look, the german way is
custom for each window and NO examples...I told Armin what I wanted and he did
good!

I could just stay there for hours looking at it all!  Can't wait until you can

=09=09Attaching Files to E-Mail =20
=09=09
=09=09Readers wrote in saying they thought attaching WAVs to e-mail was a g=
reat=20
idea, but how do you do it? It's easy! First you have to save the WAV in a=
=20
folder, which you can name ""My Sounds"" or ""WAV Files"" or ""Funny Noises.""=20
Create the appropriate folder, and then save the sound file in it. To do=20
that, go to the Web page, click on the file you want to save, and choose=20
""Save this file to disk."" Navigate to your sound folder and click ""save.""=
=20
When you're ready to attach it to an e-mail, open a new message and, in=20
Outlook, choose Insert-File (or click the paper clip icon). In Netscape the=
=20
attach button and the paper clip icon are on the same button -- other e-mai=
l=20
programs, like Eudora, have similar features. Just navigate to the folder=

with all your sounds in it, and click the one you want to add. You can't ma=

=20
open files automatically when they are received -- a bad idea beca! use of=

the virus risk. Remember, never open an attachment from a source you don't=

know and trust, even if it says it's a picture, sound, or text file -- clev=

viruses hide their true file extension. You open a seemingly harmless=20

1276,"Subject: Toby & Cindy - new baby

I just received this from my friend. I don't remember who I sent the prayer
request to for the couple having a baby. I thank you for your prayers
though. It is amazing how God will be glorified through this situation.
Kristy


Hey guys -

Thanks for  all the prayers for Toby and Cindy.  Cindy had the baby on
Tuesday and as of last night, Thursday, he was doing well.  He does have
anencephaly.  The back part of his skull is not formed and they don't
know how long he will live.  They are still in the hospital and will probably
remain there.  Toby and Cindy are doing really well and the baby has
touched many lives in the few days he has been here.  His name is Ian 
Christian.
He weighed 5 lbs. 15 ounces and I'm not sure of the length.  I guess nurses
have been coming in wanting to see him and many have cried.  Ian's
pediatrician, which she is from India, asked Toby and Cindy about their
faith because they are doing so well.

My husband and I were talking about this last night and I can't even
imagine going through this; but what about those people that don't know 
Christ as their Personal Savior.  How would they ever get through it?

I'll keep you all up to date.  Toby and Cindy told Ian that he could go
be with Jesus, but as of last night he's still here.  God must still have
some more lives for him to touch before he goes Home.

Keep them in your prayers and thanks for all the prayers, I know they
feel them.

Love to you all - Molly

Note that our forward curves for Transco Zone 5 (summer only) show a basis of

between the parties.  The collateral language is incorporated into the
document.  Also, with respect to the Collateral Agreement for Duke Energy
Merchants LLC (""DEM""), Duke would like to propose assigning all of the
Enron transactions with DEM into one Enron entity and then using the form
of collateral agreement submitted to ENA (with some tweaking to allow for a
Guaranty from Duke Capital Corporation) to cover the transactions between
the Enron counterparty and DEM.  Duke can present a list of companies which
it has outstanding transactions with if Enron would like.  Please let me

created a new subcommittee, the Expedited Data Development (EDD)
Subcommittee.  The EDD Subcommittee has been charged with the development of
the information requirements standards for (1) imbalance netting and trading
and (2) title transfer tracking.   The Executive Committee placed a higher
priority on the imbalance netting and trading topic.

    The subcommittee's first meeting is scheduled on March 13 and 14 in
Houston, hosted at the Dynegy offices, to be held from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
 Please join me in thanking Ms. Hess of Enron Gas Pipeline Group and Ms.
Munson of Altra Energy Technologies for volunteering their time to lead this
effort.

    An agenda and work papers will be posted on the GISB Home Page shortly
for this first meeting.  The first meeting will address imbalance netting and
trading ONLY.

    If you or other representatives of your company would like your email
address to be maintained on an email distribution list for this subcommittee,
please forward your name, email address, phone and fax to the GISB office.

The race is on for new coal-fired generation

The race is on! Power plant developers have responded aggressively to the
power crisis in the West and the potential for power shortages in the
Midwest and Northeast, according to a report, New Coal-Fired Generation: The
Race Is On, by Boulder, Colo.-based RDI Consulting.

Using data compiled by RDI, a data division of Platts, the report estimates
the U.S. will require 296,000 MW of capacity additions by 2015 to meet
growing demand and to replace older units likely to retire. This compares
with roughly 780,000 MW of installed capacity in the U.S. today. 

RDI also projects that almost 60% of the required capacity will be built by
the end of 2006 and, despite extreme volatility in natural gas prices, the
majority of this new capacity will be gas-fired-equaling nearly 170,000 MW.
Because of that fact, for developers looking to build coal-fired plants, the
race has turned into a marathon. 

The advantage of proposed coal-fired generation is the potential for low
dispatch costs. Hypothetical plants modeled by RDI in all areas of the
country show new coal-fired generation can dispatch well ahead of gas-fired
plants and somewhat ahead of most existing coal-fired plants. 

Disadvantages of new coal-fired generation are higher initial capital costs
and greater risk, which means that new coal-fired plants are susceptible to
depressed market prices that could result from overbuilding new capacity.
Developers will have two choices in the near term if coal plants are to
succeed: wait out the surge of capacity development and be prepared to enter
the market later in the decade when the excess capacity is absorbed; or
secure long term power sales agreements and capacity contracts that will
provide enough revenue to cover the high development costs of a new coal
plant. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com.

OPEC's Khelil requests meeting with Russia's Putin
OPEC President Chakib Khelil said Tuesday he had requested a meeting with
Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""We have asked as the OPEC presidency for
a meeting with the Russian President, Mr Putin, we have not yet had a
response,"" Khelil told reporters in Algiers. OPEC is currently lobbying
Russia to make a more significant contribution to a planned OPEC/non-OPEC
round of output cuts than the 50,000 barrels per day pledged by Moscow late
last week. OPEC agreed at its Nov. 14 meeting to reduce crude output by 1.5
million barrels per day, but only if non-OPEC producers contribute a further
500,000 barrels per day reduction. Mexico has said it is willing to cut by
100,000 barrels per day, while Norway said last week it would cut by
100,000-200,000 barrels per day, as long as other producers honor their cut
pledges.

Nordic to build power plant, ethanol facility in Ohio
Nordic Energy plans to develop the first new coal-fired baseload project in
Ohio in more than a decade, an 850-MW merchant plant in the northeast part
of the state, the company said Tuesday. The coal plant, which would utilize
integrated gasification combined cycle technology, would be a cogeneration
facility that also would produce steam to run an ethanol production plant
that affiliated Nordic Biofuels intends to build nearby. Nordic Energy will
initiate an anticipated 18-month permitting process for the coal plant early
next year. Commercial operation is expected in June 2006. The coal plant is
expected to cost about $1 billion, and the ethanol facility about $150
million. ""We decided this is the time to build our own plant and move
forward,"" said Joni Fixel, Nordic Energy director of power supply.

CPUC ALJ Calls for Cost-Based Peaking Charge on SoCalGas 
A recommended decision by a California Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge would replace the controversial Residual Load Service (RLS) tariff on Southern California Gas mainlines with a cost-based peaking service (D.00-04-060). 
SoCalGas had proposed either a market-based or cost-based peaking rate in place of the RLS. ALJ Carol A. Brown rejected the market-based rates, saying the cost-based system ""is consistent with our policy of promoting economic bypass."" Opponents of SoCal's RLS rate have called it an ""anti-bypass"" tariff, saying it effectively kept new interstates out of SoCalGas territory since customers would have to pay the interstate's rates as well as SoCal's RLS charge (See Daily GPI, April 23 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010423g.html>). 
The judge said ""the cost-based peaking tariff should include a customer charge computed monthly, based on the higher of either the current monthly usage or the highest monthly usage over the prior 12-month period; a Public Purpose Program (PPP) charge based on the PPP rates adopted by the Commission in Resolution G-3303; a reservation charge for transportation using noncore coincident peak demand for the calculation of the demand charge; and an Interstate Transition Cost Surcharge, collected as a separate volumetric rate, to be applied to the actual recorded, monthly, throughput."" 
Also the peaking tariff ""shall: (a) be a system-wide rate; (b) customers shall balance their nominations and burns daily; (c) partial bypass customers shall not be eligible for SIC credit; and (d) the tariff shall apply on a facility-by-facility basis."" It also will be subject to review in the SoCalGas Biannual Cost Allocation Proceeding. 
The judge recommended that SoCalGas file for a conforming peaking tariff within 10 days of approval of the decision. The decision must be reviewed by the full CPUC.

Sonoran Pipeline -  Calls to various levels of Kinder-Morgan management have elicited no response.  Sources indicate their project is still moving forward but is having ""marketing issues"".
ROW - A large diameter water line that serves Palo Verde runs from West Phoenix to the nuclear plant.  One thought was to use the ROW to install the gas line and reach the new generation plants in the area.   However, AZ Public Service indicated that the water line is constantly being replaced due to corrosion and repair work may interfere with any other line in the same easement.
Cost estimate - Current fully-loaded cost estimate (including interest, overheads, ROW, etc.) is $680mm based on a reduced scale project of 500,000 MMBtu/d capacity to Phoenix.  Various deal structures are being analyzed to present several pricing options to the market.  Likely minimum term will be 20 years based on the cost.
Marketing -
	Duke - Met 10/25.  They have a need for 40,000 - 120,000 MMBtu/d and would likely take capacity on Sun Devil at a ""competitive"" rate.  Preparing rate 	offerings for their review 11/5.
	AZ Public Service -  Met 10/24.  They are very interested in the project and would commit today if they were given an economic out based on unfavorable 	outcome of El Paso / FERC full requirements proceeding.  Working to develop an MOU with out clause if they fund the early EIS work.
	Sempra - No response yet.
	Southwest Gas - Still interested in the project but unwilling to commit due to El Paso full requirements issue.  They are however interested in doing a JV to 	utilize their Phoenix lateral to enable the Sun Devil project to tie into the El Paso south system.
	Panda Energy - Meeting set in Dallas on 11/2.  Panda has the capability to be the anchor shipper for the project.

Preparing detailed supply basin study for management review.

I just now had a chance to make a final review of the contract and noticed a
couple of items:

1.  Section 8.8. Confidentiality (page 5)

""and wire instructions"" was inserted in the wrong place.  Could you change
it to read:  ""The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any
Transaction and wire instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality
obligation.""

2.  Exhibit ""A""  Customer Invoices

Under the address for CPS invoices, you inserted ""Purchase Order Number
_________.""  Since we do not know at this time what the purchase order
number will be, could we delete this.  Otherwise, it looks as if the

1335,"Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we ""need"" ""financially firm"" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that ""financially firm"" ""needed"" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
""financially firm"" out and ""firm"" substituted.

The definition for ""firm"" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for ""firm"" that is in the GISB as follows:

""Firm"" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that ""Financially Firm""
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of ""Financially Firm"" to just
""firm""?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through ""Financially"" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX ""1"" would have to be
redone to replace ""Financially Firm"" with just ""Firm"".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

travelling.

Let me give you some observations that hopefully may assist. All you have to 
look at are two things;
Any Japanese legal restrictions on the potential counterparty trading with 
Enron Japan
Any Japanese legal restrictions on the types of products a Japanese 
incorporated counterparty may trade.    

As far a restrictions specific to a non-Japanese product then that is the 
responsibility of the lawyer in the relevant jurisdiction. For example
if there are restrictions under Australian law on a Japanese company trading 
through  EOL with Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd for Australian power
then that is my concern. 

Hope this makes it clearer. Please give me a call if you have any

1459,"Vince,
The PSerc meeting Lance and I went to was both interesting
and boring. PSerc has 11 school members  and 30 industry members. Its Research
Program consists of three stems:  Markets, Transmission and Distribution,
and Systems. (Enron's interests probably lie mainly in the first stem.) 

In morning of the first day, researchers from universities
presented their project proposals. I found some of them 
quite interesting. For example, Shmuel Oren, Fernando Alvarado,
Tim Mount (of Cornell) propose to study ""Market Redesign: Incorporating
the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market
design,""  Shijie Deng, S. Oren et al propose to study "" Power asset
valuation model in a market-based and reliability-constrained electric
power system."" The first got funded but the second did not. 

In the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their
own discussion. I went to the academic discussion and Lance the
industry one.  I hope my presence there did not make things worse, for
the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion. 
The proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants. 

The proposal process goes as follows: researchers first write a short 
proposal to appropriate stem committee (no industry participantion, it seems 
to me),
each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4. The 
selected
proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry.  Industry then
gets to vote which proposals get funded.  However, some researchers were
very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process. There were
accusation of self-ranking, communication between stem committee and
member schools breaking down, and so on. Some were even asking for 
some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before  wrting it 
(the arguement was ""Then it was a waste of our time to write proposals"", 
which I found quite amusing). 

All in all, I found the process was not taken seriously enough by university 
researchers. PSerc has been established for 5 years now and it still does 
not have a proper proposal screen process, which is hard to believe. Also, 
the communication among university researchers, between stem committee 
and member schools, and most importantly, between researchers and industry, 
are not  smooth as all.

Since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members, the ""right""
projects may not get funded. Too many participants also make the decision
process very indecisive and quite painful to watch (Lance can comment on
this better).  They also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which
made the voting a less authoritive.

I believe Enron will not get much returns from join PSerc (price tag is 
$40,000
per company per year).  If we find some projects interesting, we can sponsor
the schools in the form of summer interns, the schools claim that most of the 
fund
goes to support students anyway.

Thanks very much for your interest in our MarketPoint product, and thanks
for the hour you gave me this morning.  As promised, I am enclosing our
executive summary and first chapter from our business plan for you to take
forward to your management as a prospective Enron-MarketPoint investment
collaboration.  I want to reiterate that should Enron elect to be the lead
investor here, you will be exclusive in your industry if you want.  If Enron
wants to be the lead and ensure the entire second round of resources we
need, we would not offer and investment opportunity to other trading
companies, pipelines, or electrics until the third or subsequent rounds and
then only with your participation as a MarketPoint board member.  I am aware
you have coinvested with SAP in the past and that you might want to coinvest
with them again.  I presume you would not have a problem with
non-competitors such as EPRI, our management consulting service provider
partner, or our VC partner (but I would want guidance from you in this
arena).  I think you would find our VC partner very suitable and very
attractive.  They have done several interesting energy and trading plays,
and they would provide good management skills I believe.  I hope we can move
forward together.  I am looking forward to a positive response.  Thanks

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments.","Kristin Walsh Davis Bowen Tony  Strickland Lehman Davis

1474,"Executive Summary
? Davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for 
past utility debt
? Davis and PG&E negotiations at a standstill, sticking point is net short 
for PG&E this summer 
? As the days go on with no word of a secured deal, involuntary bankruptcy 
chances increase significantly among small generators and QFs
? FERC would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions 
for California

California Public Utility Commission Rate Increases 
Today may be the turning point as the CA PUC reviews the size of the 
Department of Water Resources  (DWR) rate increase to be passed along to 
consumers on their electricity bills.  Until now, Davis has considered rate 
hikes to be political suicide, but there may be some relief for him from 
consumer groups.   Sources indicate that one of California's main consumer 
advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption, 
but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt.  DWR, 
which is currently buying power on behalf of the state, needs more income to 
securitize the planned $10B bond issue that is key part of Davis' plan to 
sign long term power contracts.  As DWR continues to spend $40 to $60 M every 
day on power purchases, a well placed source informed us the DWR is 
essentially bankrupt.  It currently has no money for normal activities such 
as ordering supplies, purchasing new equipment, etc.  The Department of 
Finance is forwarding DWR money from where ever it can (parks, other 
programs) to purchase power, but DWR's hands are tied until revenue bonds are 
issued.  The California State Treasurer Phil Angelides will be submitting a 
recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $10 
billion worth of state bonds. 

Davis & PG&E at Odds 
Sources report that Davis and PG&E negotiations are facing two difficult 
challenges: 1) PG&E wants 2.9 times book, which is far more than consumer 
groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines (SCE accepted 2.3), 
and 2) PG&E needs relief from Davis for PG&Es legal responsibility to be the 
ultimate power purchaser for the state, and at this point Davis wants to 
limit further state energy power purchases (especially for summer).  The 
utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars 
further in the red ($3 to $4 B) and PG&E may declare bankruptcy for their 
utility subsidiary if Davis tries to force the issue.  Additionally, Davis is 
being hounded by the press and Harvey Rosenfield to publish details of the 
states' 40 long-term power contracts; a measure that if accomplished would 
provide Davis with even less negotiating power.

With all this activity, Davis is starting to lose support in the state 
legislature.  Sources report increasing tension between the Governor and 
State Senate President Pro-tem John Burton.  Burton has just announced a 
special Senate Committee will investigate the generators for evidence of 
price manipulation, and the State Auditor is also planning an investigation.  
Davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being 
picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later.

QF's Most Likely Source of Involuntary Bankruptcy
Sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience 
and force bankruptcy on the utilities.  SB 47X may have been California's 
Qualified Facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing 
against PG&E, SoCal Ed, and SDG&E.  The bill designed to cut the QF's costs 
and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the State's 
senate.  Sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further 
investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates.

Out with Hebert, In with Wood
The Bush administration favors replacing Hebert, Jr. with Texas PUC head Pat 
Wood.  There is an intense battle behind the scenes between Senate Republican 
Leader Trent Lott , who favors Hebert, and President Bush, who wants Wood.  
The administration would prefer Wood because they do not want FERC to pick a 
fight with Davis which means Bush might ultimately lose some western states 
in 2004.  In effort to tone down the recent press reports, Hebert has made 
several token concessions to California, including $69 million worth of power 
refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and 
power plant installation.  

It's is expected that FERC would most likely approve any transmission deal 
that Davis could complete but with a list of conditions.  Some conditions 
might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well 
as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic Administrative actions in 
the West next year.  The Bush Administration is opposed to price caps and 
believes in free market solutions.  The Administration is also considering 
whether it might be a good idea to privatize Federally-owned assets such as 
BPA.

The key variable is the number of trade per day, therefore is varied  from 
200 to 1000 trades.

Scenarios are generated by different spreads, net open position allowed, and 
time period.

Take a look what I have prepared, and let me know things you want to add or

Dear  Visit
 
The  results you have obtained are usually caused by regressing the lagged return  instead of the leading return. That is you must regress the return of the period  following the log price against which you regressing:

also went to the Chief Investment Officer of the San Diego Pension Fund (a

 Phil Roan, the quantitative analyst from Koch's weather derivatives group 
will be here on the afternoon of Friday June 16, beginning say, at 1:30 or 
2:00. Vince asked me to ask you to put a set of interviews together (as I 
understand, Vince himself will be unavailable that day). 

 Mark Tawney should see him; someone from weather marketing and/or 
structuring should see him, e.g. Gary Taylor and/or Michael Nguyen; some more 
people from research should grill him on technical and meteorology issues, 
e.g. Vasant and/or Zimin as well as Mike Roberts or someone on his team. Phil 
has only been a ""quant"" since the departure of Koch's previous weather quant 
in February; before that he was Koch's weather ""risk manager"". I am still not 
sure what the distinction means, but we do need to find out how much he knows 
about option pricing and meteorology. Even though his expressed desire is to 
focus on weather derivatives, we should also assess how useful he would be 
from research group's perspective, since research will likely be his official 
home.

 Finally, Jere Overdyke and/or someone else from his group (George Carrick, 
if available) should also get a chance to meet with him. I've already spoken 
with Phil, but I'd like to sit in with either Vasant or Zimin or Mike when 
they interview him, since I wasn't able to ask any technical questions.

 If I'm counting correctly, that should amount to five interview sessions, 
perhaps less if we interview in groups of two. Phil's resume is enclosed 
below.

Joe

P.S. I will also forward this to Jason Sokolov. He will let you know if any 
people from RAC would also like to meet with him.

As you can imagine, after Jeff Skilling's resignation,
Greg Whalley will be tied up in a few additional stock analysts' presentations.

We are still planning trips to California and New Mexico that we would like to combine
and would like very much to meet and exchange opinions with you.

Please, advise me about your availability during the next 2 - 3 weeks. Hopefully, we
can reconcile our schedules and meet soon.

A Measurement  Framework for Bank Liquidity Risk 
September 15,  2000
Raymond Cote
Vice President, FinRad Inc.

Raymond  Cote is Vice President, Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based  consulting firm offering financial management solutions that 
combine advisory  and systems development services to &corporations and 
financial  institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity risk, as opposed to credit and  market risks, has received little 
attention in professional or academic  journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk can be viewed as a  variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some concepts and  definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to measure a bank's  structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the framework with  modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure.  The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration of the  liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

Thanks for the additions.  I will add to the Asset / Responsibility Matrix.

The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of 
Sovereign Risk (with the other element being Political Risk).  Regulatory 
Risk is a ""legal"" action taken by a government or its agent which modifies 
Enron's business environment, most often directly through modifications in 
the energy and communications markets, but also in broad areas such as taxes 
and export - import policies.  Political Risk is a ""supra-legal"" action that 
has the same impact (e.g., expropriation).

Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group (Fiona Grant is member) is trying 
to put in place a ""standard"" process to review and analyze regualtory risk 
around the globe - quite an undertaking.  When I use the term Regulatory Risk 
Management, I am primarily talking about such a process.  The key elements of 
any risk management function are (1) identification, (2) assessment, (3) 
mitigation / transference, and (4) audit.  You would probably agree that the 
most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Risk 
event.  The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an 
assigned person to ""manage"" our activities so that Enron does not face an 
associated loss.

My goal is to try an have this process in place by mid-year.  That would 
include having undertaken a structured review of our current Assets (the 
reason for the original questions) and the ability to review pending deals. 

When you come over to Houston next week I would really like to sit down and 
go through my thoughts with you.  

Thanks.

flexibility in considering control options other than SCR when determining 
the control requirements.

TNRCC Comments on Houston Non-attainment Regulations - Marc Phillips is 
preparing Enron's comments to TNRCC regarding their proposed regulations for 
the Houston Non-attainment area. Enron will be supporting the Business 
Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) comments, but will have additional comments on 
the cap and trade program and engine control requirements. The draft comments

TNRCC Inspection of Mont Belvieu facility - Marc Phillips assisted plant 
personnel with a TNRCC air inspection of the Mont Belvieu underground storage 
facility.

Greenhouse Gas Emission Credits - Marc Phillips has been discussing a 
possible trade with Indaco, a company that surveys gas pipeline compressor 
stations for methane leaks. Indaco will perform a survey at a station in 
Kansas in return for greenhouse gas emission credits. He has been talking to 
Enron traders to determine the value of a greenhouse gas credit.

Enron Day of Caring - Russell Tucker provided employee safety oversight 
during the Enron Day of Caring activities at the Depelchan Children's Center. 
Safety concerns encountered ranged from the intended use of Benzene 
containing materials without proper personal protective equipment to 
inhalation, skin contact and fire hazards in handling flammable solvents. 
Safety supplies were ordered and distributed prior to the start of the 
projects for the hazards known to exist.

Enron Ergo Program Evaluation - Russell Tucker reports 50% of the 3 AC Enron 
proposed Ergo Program evaluations are complete with some program bugs being 
reported and already being addressed by the software development team. All 
exit interviews report very positive on the program itself and highly 
recommend it. Linda Adels continues to work with EDS to get the CBT program 
installed and the workstation assessment available on the Internet for the 
Enron Building participants. EDS is requiring a security request be made for 
each person to load  the CD-ROM's and updating of the Internet browser on all 
the involved computers. None of these problems would be present with these 
programs installed and run from the Enron Intranet, which is the intended 
method should the program be adopted for global use. 

Environmental Notice on Corps of Engineers Revisions - Jim Peterson is 
preparing an Environmental Notice on the Corps of Engineers revisions to the 
nation-wide permit regulations.

Enron House Presentations-Mike Terraso made EHS organization and role 
presentations in London to the operations/engineering group sponsored by 
Brian Stanley and the government affairs group sponsored by Mark Schroeder .  
The annual EHS report was reviewed with the groups.

US-UK Discussion Group on Security and Human Rights in the Extractive Sector 
-Mike Terraso participated in the US State Department/ British  Foreign and 
Commonwealth  Office sponsored review of the draft agreement on security and 
human rights.  Other industry participants included Occidental Petroleum, 
Freeport -Mac Moran, Conoco, Chevron, Shell , BP, Rio Tinto, Texaco.  NGOs 
represented were Prince of Wales, Amnesty International, International Alert, 
Business for Social Responsibility, and Human Rights Watch.  The revised 
draft agreement will be sent to participants by the US State Department on 
September 29th.

Conference Board Chief EHS officers Council - Mike Terraso , at the request 
of the Conference Board, made a presentation on corporate responsibility and 
reputation to the international conference convening in London.

 Shell International Oil and Gas- Mike Terraso met with Shell International 
governance and EHS management.  Mechanisms to better coordinate personnel 
visits, audits and action plans , contractor reviews were discussed  and 
agreed upon.

Cuiaba II - Joe Kolb  reports that OPIC release of funding for Cuiaba I is 
now the end of September.  This means that work on the compressor stations 
will not begin in earnest until then.  I expect to view proposed and 
alternate compressor station locations during next visit to area now expected 
to be in late October.  Edgar Zuleta (Corp EH&S) in Bolivia is providing 
valuable assistance in coordinating trip plans.

BMPs - Joe Kolb is waiting for a response from Norm Spalding (EE&CC) whom 
Jerry Martin assigned the proposed pipeline BMPs for review.  A message has 
been left with Norm.  A response was promised by the end of last week.   Bill 
Osborne (GPG) received feedback from Steenberg and Shafer in GPG.  All 
comments helpful and none propose significant changes to document.  Bill 
Osborne has sent BMPs to others within GPG.  GPG reorg may delay responses.  
Wilson Dietrich (Enron Broad Band) has indicated that he will be the proper 
person to review fiber optic BMPs.  The consultant is proceeding with work on 
the electric transmission and fiber optic BMPs.  Wilson will be sent draft as 
soon as it is received.

Project Dolphin - Joe Kolb met with Michael Johns (contact employee of EE&CC) 
to discuss status of environmental component of this middle eastern pipeline 
project.  Things are moving slowly.  An RFP has been sent out and responses 
from 7 environmental consulting firms  are being reviewed.  The RFP is for 
the EIA and EIA field work.  They expect to choose a consultant in about 2 
weeks.  Field work is expected to begin after the first of the year.  The 
project has been scaled back.

World Resources Institute Conference - Susan Worthen represented Enron at the 
WRI Conference in Washington, D.C., which featured panel discussions on a 
number of environmental and social issues facing corporations.  Besides 
corporate representatives, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, The Nature 
Conservancy, Habitat for Animals, World Wildlife Fund, Conservation 
International and the NRDC.  Many recognized and applauded Enron for its 
first appearance and partication.  There may be potential interest in working 
with WRI on future projects.

Environmental Policy Center - We have subscribed to a trial subscription of  
EPC's environmental and safety regulatory and legislative monitoring service 
for Brazil and U.K. and have received the first electronic report.  We are 
now awaiting feedback from regional reviewers to determine if there is 
anything we would like to enhance or change prior to signing an agreement for 
continued and expanded service.  This service will allow the Reg/Leg, 
Environmental Strategies, and regional EHS personnel to track pending and 
proposed legislation in other countries.

(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Power Marketing Inc. is urging federal 
regulators to withdraw the authority of several electric utilities in the 
U.S. Southeast to sell power at market rates if they fail to join an approved 
independent grid-asset operator by Dec. 15, 2001. 
The Enron Corp. (ENE) power-marketing unit made the suggestion in filings 
Friday in response to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's 
December 1999 order encouraging U.S. utilities to turn their high-voltage 
transmission assets over to independent control of regional transmission 
organizations, or RTOs.
The filing came the same day that FERC Commissioner William Massey told a 
gathering of energy lawyers that he would seek to ensure that FERC - on a 
generic, national basis - makes preservation of market-based sales authority 
by utilities contingent upon their joining an FERC-approved RTO. 
Enron limited the applicability of its filing to RTO proposals from utilities

Absent participation in a FERC-approved RTO, ""there is no basis for the 
commission to assume that a transmission owner has mitigated its transmission 
market power and ability to discriminate against its transmission-dependent 
competitors,"" Enron said in its filing. 
Enron noted that FERC called for creation of RTOs after determining that its 
landmark 1996 rules requiring open-access transmission services weren't 
enough to assure that vertically integrated utilities couldn't control their 
transmission assets to financial gain in competitive wholesale power markets. 
""The commission has repeatedly recognized that vertically integrated 
transmission system owners have an inherent incentive to use their 
transmission monopolies to discriminate in favor of their own and affiliated 
power merchant activities,"" Enron said. 
The Houston energy giant noted that FERC staff, in a report detailing 
findings of a national investigation of problems affecting competitive 
wholesale power markets nationally, found that market participants in the 
Southeastern U.S. have less confidence than market participants in other 
regions of the country that their transactions won't be subject to 
discriminatory practices. 
""Selling power at market-based (as opposed to cost-based) rates is not a 
right, but rather a privilege enjoyed by sellers that can demonstrate that 
they are price takers, unable to exercise market power,"" Enron said. 
""Any vertically integrated transmission monopoly that stops short of taking 
every step that the commission identifies as needed to abate market power and 
root out discrimination should be denied the privilege of selling power at 
market-based rates. It simply cannot be trusted not to abuse the privilege,"" 
Enron said.

In case you have not already seen it, I thought you might be interested in
the recent posting on a French website of an announcement of Andre LeGallo's
departure from Enron and some commentary about the company's purported links
to the CIA and the US political establishment.

This website can be accessed at www.intelligenceonline.com.  It is believed
to be published by French persons with close connections to the French
security services and also, reportedly, to Israeli intelligence.  The
website includes free content (of which this report was a part) and premium
content available on a subscription basis only.  The Andre LeGallo posting
could reflect the purely detached academic/professional interest of the
publishing entity.  It is also worth considering that it would be a
convenient document for one of your competitors to pass on to a foreign
government with whom you might be negotiating, particularly if that
government had elements or constituencies sensitive to the perception of
links to U.S. intelligence.

Please let me know if you would like any further information on this matter.

(INTELLIGENCE NEWSLETTER #376 - 17/02/2000)
UNITED STATES : Enron Loses Intelligence Star
The U.S. gas and electricity utility Enron has parted ways with Andre Le
Gallo who was in charge of dealing with the group's most sensitive cases. A
former CIA official known for his extreme discretion, Le Gallo quit the
Houston-based company in January to open his own business intelligence firm,
AJL Global Risks Solutions.
His recent departure was known to only a few North American consultants. In
his job as Enron's vice president for security, Le Gallo had worked behind
the scenes on all of the difficult cases facing the group that required
maximum confidentiality.
Some believe his career with Enron served to underline the close links that
reportedly exist between the company and the CIA. The first claims to that
effect were made in the early 1990s when Kenneth Lay, founder and president
of Enron appeared as a major financial backer of then-U.S. president George
Bush. It was said Enron won favors from the American intelligence community,
with the White House's blessings.
One instance supposedly occurred in June, 1992 in India when Enron's local
affiliate Dabhol Power Company won the right to operate on huge gas
resources at Maharashtra near Bombay, in highly controversial circumstances.
At the time, Indian political leaders suspected the American ambassador in
New Delhi, Franck Wisner, of having asked the CIA station chief in the
Indian capital to ensure Enron won the contract. A few years later, on Dec.
15, 1997, the same Franck Wisner was named a director of Enron Gas & Oil Co.
In a further example of ambiguous links, the State Department is accused of
also backing Enron in 1993 in negotiations for a contract to restore oil
wells on the Shuaiba field in Kuwait that had been damaged during the Gulf
War. Enron got the contract even though its bid was less advantageous than a
lower bid submitted by Germany's Deutsche Babcock. The existence of ties
between the former Bush administration and Enron can be seen in a new light
in view of the coming presidential campaign in the U.S. According to a
report by the Federal Election Commission, Bush's son --George W. Bush --
has already used an aircraft owned by the Enron company seven times since he
began his race for the presidency.

Dabhol lenders to vote today on PPA PPPPA termination

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The 25-odd lenders to the Dabhol power project will vote today on whether the 
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) should be allowed to to serve a 
preliminary PPA termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB). The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing 
the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian 
lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of 
India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they 
will not be able to block the move.
Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in 
favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 
25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone 
conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. 
Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not 
participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries 
including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and 
OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. ""In the first round, Indian lenders put 
their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. 
Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian 
lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign 
lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice,"" said a source. The 
Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and 
cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore 
worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is 
complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the 
Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K 
Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a 
meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen 
that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal 
to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The 
domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is 
terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a 
statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or 
about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to 
meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. 
Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , 
proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.
Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its 
transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. 
In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it 
would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that 
will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. 
The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or 
enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement 
said. 
SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in 
central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate 
transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to 
over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. 
The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas 
pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump 
because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for 
construction. 
Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. 
And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern 
River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave 
Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, 
Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.
At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that ""industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia."" 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX

05/15/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made 
with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), 
whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading 
system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas 
Price Indices. 
NGX acquired the AECO ""C"" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot 
gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. 
last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the 
establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions 
conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues 
to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.
Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, ""We believe that inclusion of data 
from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North 
America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and 
integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which 
removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after 
reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we 
recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that 
""more is better"". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline 
system should improve the quality of our price indices even further."" 
Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, ""We are very 
pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive 
source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price 
indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline 
will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices."" 
The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by 
Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and 
Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action 
against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. 
NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by 
August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to 
the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant 
contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The 
methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be 
on a weighted-average basis. 
NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index 
Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com. 
NGX located in Calgary, Canada provides electronic trading and clearing 
services to natural gas buyers and sellers at seven markets in Canada. Over

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 
billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the 
U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a 
United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. 
Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the 
project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.
Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans 
to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore 
North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. 
Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while 
UOG owns the remaining 51%. 
Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas 
transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government 
would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. 
However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put 
up the money itself. 
Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay 
significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will
operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing
natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are 
scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 
2005. 

Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners 
haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on 
the price of the pipeline. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an 
initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full 
agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.

1648,"EPA's Mercury determination was released today.  It can be accessed at 
www.epa.gov/mercury

It will likely take some time for EPA to develop these regulations -- the 
time frame is proposed rule by 2003 and final rule by 2004 -- but this is a 
significant step in that it now formally puts mercury on the radar screen for 
power generators, in terms of planning for emissions controls.

It is a positive step that EPA included in its determination an intent to 
develop ""flexible"" compliance measures -- i.e. trading -- for mercury.  It 
also means that mercury will most likely be included in any efforts to 
develop ""multi-pollutant"" legislation in the next Congress.

Please call me if you have any questions.

EPA DECIDES MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM
POWER PLANTS MUST BE REDUCED

To protect public health and the environment, EPA Administrator Carol M. 
Browner today announced that the Clinton Administration will require 
reductions, for the first time ever, of  harmful mercury emissions from 
coal-fired power plants -- the largest source of such emissions in America.  
After extensive study, EPA determined mercury emissions from power plants 
pose significant hazards to public health and must be reduced.  The agency 
will propose regulations by 2003 and issue final rules by 2004.

""Mercury from power plants settles over waterways, polluting rivers and 
lakes, and contaminating fish. Exposure to mercury poses real risks to public 
health, especially to children and developing fetuses,"" Browner said.  ""The 
greatest source of mercury emissions is power plants, and they have never 
been required to control these emissions before now.  Today's decision to 
address this problem marks a major step forward in the Clinton 
Administration's ongoing efforts to protect public health and the 
environment.""

Exposure to mercury has been associated with both neurological and 
developmental damage in humans. The developing fetus is the most sensitive to 
mercury's effects, which include damage to nervous system development. People 
are exposed to mercury primarily through eating fish that have been 
contaminated when mercury from power plants and other sources is deposited to 
water bodies.  Once mercury enters water, biological processes can transform 
it into methylmercury, a highly toxic form of mercury that builds up in 
animal and human tissues.  EPA recommends that subsistence fisherman, 
pregnant women, and others should always heed state fishing advisories.

Under the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to study toxic air pollution from 
power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in 
order to protect public health.  EPA reported its study to Congress in 
February 1998.  That study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined, 
mercury posed the greatest concern to public health.  An earlier study 
concluded that the largest source of human-made mercury pollution in
America was coal-fired power plants.

After completion of the study, the Clean Air Act required EPA to determine 
whether to proceed with the development of regulations.  Today, EPA is 
announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from 
power plants should be regulated, because mercury poses the greatest hazards 
to public health.

EPA will propose regulations by December 2003 and will begin developing those 
regulations shortly.  Industry, the public, and state, local and tribal 
governments will have an opportunity to participate in the process.  Then, 
EPA will issue final regulations by December 2004.

The Clinton Administration already has taken a number of aggressive actions 
to reduce mercury air pollution, including significantly reducing allowable 
emissions from municipal waste combustors, medical waste incinerators and 
hazardous waste combustors.  When fully implemented in 2005, the existing 
rules will reduce total human-caused mercury emissions by nearly 50 percent 
from 1990 levels nationwide.

On November 11, 2000 President Clinton called for a dramatic new approach to 
reduce air pollution from America's power plants.  The President highlighted 
the benefits of adopting a combined strategy to address all of the major 
pollutants emitted by power plants, including mercury, sulfur dioxide, 
nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide.  A comprehensive strategy that addresses 
all of these pollutants together will provide more certainty and flexibility 
to industry, making it the most cost-effective way to control the emissions 
that threaten public health and the environment.  As the Clean Air Act 
requires, the regulatory process to control mercury will proceed under 
current law.  However, at the same time, the Administration encourages the 
Executive Branch and the Congress to work toward legislating a comprehensive 
four pollutant approach, which will benefit the public health, the 
environment, and the economy.

Today's decision will appear soon in the Federal Register, but is accessible 
immediately on EPA's mercury web site at: www.epa.gov/mercury   Also, today 
EPA is posting, on its website, mercury emissions from every coal-fired power 
plant in the country.  This is consistent with EPA's strong commitment to 
provide citizens with information about pollution in their communities.

Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) called yesterday for a Justice Department 
review of White House senior advisor Karl Rove's repeated discussions with 
executives and representatives of companies in which he held stock. 
In a letter to White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, Waxman said Rove 
appeared to be in violation of federal conflict-of-interest laws.
Gonzales has said he was satisfied that Rove ""took care to avoid"" any 
impropriety in meeting in March with Intel Corp. executives, and in 
participating in broad discussions about administration energy policy while 
owning more than $100,000 worth of Intel Corp. stock and more than $200,000 
worth of stock in Enron Corp., General Electric Co. and other energy 
companies. On June 7, Rove sold more than $1 million in stock in companies 
doing business with the government. 
Waxman, ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, said 
federal law requires executive branch departments and agencies, including the 
White House, to report ""any information, allegation or complaint"" involving 
potential criminal conduct by an employee to the Justice Department. He said 
he was not aware of any reason Rove should be exempt from such outside 
investigation. 
White House spokesman Dan Bartlett said Waxman's letter is under review, but 
added, ""We are confident that Karl followed all ethical guidelines and 
statutes in his role as senior adviser to the president.""

Business World: How To Execute 10%, Nicely
By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.

07/18/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A19
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

How come Ford adopts the same white-collar performance review system as 
General Electric but gets vilified for it, hounded by discrimination lawyers 
and AARP? Last week, less than a year after launching it, CEO Jacques Nasser 
was moved to dump a brand new executive grading system designed to weed out 
the least capable 10% of Ford's managers. 
The short answer is that Ford isn't GE, though Jack Welch has been a model 
for what Mr. Nasser seeks to accomplish at the auto company.
Bringing such a Torquemada system into a firm that faces slowing sales and 
whose own boss considers his colleagues notoriously flabby and easy on 
themselves meant it was a downsizing scheme from the start, whether 
advertised that way or not. GE didn't introduce its version until a decade 
after the Neutron Jack phase. But never mind. Trumpeting a win last week, 
AARP declared its victory goes way beyond Ford. It sure does. 
Forced ranking has waxed and waned as a fad over the decades, and most 
students of management hold their noses around it. Its resurgence, at a time 
when many employers are contemplating their first layoffs in years, can only 
mean that companies are nervous about preserving their freedom to hire and 
fire in a world run increasingly by the job-discrimination bar. 
Ask any non-deluded European. What makes the U.S. economy relatively nimble 
is that companies are not afraid to take on workers because they know they 
can always get rid of them later. Harsh as this sounds, it's why we have a 
lush job market compared to the employment Saharas of the Old World. 
Yet firing in America has been a work in progress. Half a decade ago, 
enlightened companies tried employee buyouts, but the lawyers descended, 
forcing companies to offer the buyouts indiscriminately. Result: Highly 
marketable workers took the windfall and immediately found other jobs, while 
people who considered themselves unemployable skipped the loot and clung to 
their cubicles. 
Other companies, on the theory that it was OK to tell people they had to go 
because their functions or departments were being discontinued, bravely 
downsized the old-fashioned way. But this was no proof against lawsuits. 
Remember Texaco, Coca-Cola and others where the very existence of 
affirmative-action programs became fodder for litigation by both minorities 
and older white employees? 
Searching for a way out of the legal maze, Ford tried two years ago to 
combine forced ranking with buyouts, aiming offers exclusively at low-ranked 
employees. Result: grumbling in the hallways of ""rewarding failure"" and good 
employees angling for low grades so they could become eligible for a golden 
parachute. Finally, starting this year, Ford opted for an out-and-out forced 
ranking system, which would have given 10% of white-collar employees annually 
a ""C"" grade that meant either shape up or you're gone next year. 
Microsoft, Lucent, Conoco, Enron and EDS all have used forced ranking to 
maintain or improve the quality of their work forces. While many find the 
idea distasteful or complain it substitutes a yearly spasm for what should be 
a continuous process, at least it solves a real problem. Survey after survey 
finds that even the happiest worker-bees gripe about their employer's 
reluctance to get strict with poor performers. A recent McKinsey poll of 
managers at big companies found that only 16% said their employer could even 
recognize the difference between stars and slackers. 
But Ford was already in the soup over the Explorer/Firestone fiasco. It 
didn't stand a chance when the Detroit papers opened a new front over its 
A-B-C grading system for 18,000 managers. Accentuating the coverage was a 
simmering quest to discover any sort of rift between Mr. Nasser and his 
chairman, Bill Ford, great-grandson of the founder. 
Mr. Ford has somehow been anointed keeper of the company's conscience because 
of blood chemistry or something. Inevitably, he wants to be liked and wants 
the company to be liked. Putting a Ford in the chairmanship was probably the 
worst thing the company could have done at a time when Mr. Nasser was clearly 
set on giving the place a kick in the pants. 
In the ranking controversy, Mr. Ford soon was reported to be ""concerned about 
the system's impact on morale."" Notice how this differs from ""the system is 
an urgent necessity so Ford can become a better company."" With this kind of 
support, management quickly wilted in the face of pressure from the old-folks 
lobby (which has appointed itself guardian of anybody over 45) and other 
victim contingents. 
Mr. Nasser didn't help himself by appearing in a Ford diversity video 
haranguing an audience for containing ""too many white faces"" or by installing 
rewards for executives who meet minority hiring goals. Presto, lawsuits 
galore. The ones Ford will have the most trouble with are those filed by 
white males claiming they were victims of age discrimination in order to make 
way for blacks and women. 
One of the ironies, as Ford shows, is that companies these days have reasons 
of their own for recruiting minorities and women. Were the supposedly 
archaic, 19th-century principle of freedom of contract still in effect -- 
i.e., employers are free to hire and fire at will -- there would be a lot 
more affirmative action, a lot more honestly pursued. 
GE may not exactly be the rainbow coalition, but it does have a lesson for 
Ford. Under its version of forced rankings, 10% of managers are assigned to a 
bottom grade each year, which means they're cut off from the rich booty GE 
awards the top 20% and the job security of the workaday 70%. If low-ranked 
managers don't improve, they are asked to move on. 
A big difference, though, is that the process is not concentrated in a 
single, highly neuroticized annual ritual. GE carries on with much year-round 
mentoring and bellowing and measuring, so nobody has cause to be surprised by 
the score he gets. In fact, anyone who went to work there in the past 15 
years would have known exactly what he was getting into. 
Here's the lesson: Nobody doubts that GE's hiring and firing, whatever the 
color or gender of the fodder, is all about business. It takes time to build 
a reputation for heartlessly focusing on the bottom line, but once you do, it 
can be liberating.

RUSSIA: INTERVIEW-Russian Tyumen Oil says foreign ties to grow.
By Sujata Rao

07/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

MOSCOW, July 17 (Reuters) - Russia's Tyumen Oil Company said on Wednesday it 
planned huge expansion of its upstream and downstream profile through 
ventures with foreign oil majors. Company President Simon Kukes told Reuters 
in an interview that Tyumen - Russia's fourth-largest oil producer with 
output of 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) - would also seek a New York Stock 
Exchange listing in 2002 after market conditions improved. 
""We aim to be a multi-national company and the first step is in Ukraine, 
where we will within a year be the number one retailer of oil products,"" he 
said.
Kukes said Tyumen was also interested in Eastern Europe and in talks on 
projects that a included a stake in Lithuania's Mazeikiu refinery , but he 
declined to elaborate. 
""Eastern Europe has logistical advantages for Russian firms. We can bring in 
oil easily and get a significant market share. I also see a role for us in 
China, India and the Middle East."" He said Tyumen, controlled by Russia's 
Alfa conglomerate, saw foreign oil majors' involvement as a key to its 
growth. 
""We would welcome a strategic partner to take a stake in the firm and, in 
fact, we are now in talks with several foreign partners, including Texaco ,"" 
Kukes said. 
He added earlier talks with Phillips had had no result. 
Tyumen is involved in the $11 billion Kovykta project with BP and several 
Russian firms to produce and ship gas to China, as well as in Transneft's 
Adria pipeline project to link outlets for Russian crude in north and south 
Europe. 
In August Tyumen will take a key downstream step. 
With Texaco in Moscow it will open Russia's first Star Mart convenience store 
in a partnership expanding its 800-strong filling network by combining them 
with the U.S. Star Mart brand. 
Earlier this year the firms inked a deal to jointly produce lubricants at 
Tyumen's LINOS refinery in Ukraine. Kukes said total investments in 2001 are 
planned at $800 million, with another $1 billion earmarked for each of the 
coming years. 
Tyumen also got a boost by being rated the World's Best Oil Company in 2000 
by Financial Times Energy for ""phenomenal growth in the past year, breaking 
into the world's top 15 oil firms."" 
""By year end, we could jump from fourth to third place among Russian oil 
producers,"" said the U.S.-educated Kukes, who is part of Tyumen's efforts to 
boost its profile internationally. 
VERTICALLY INTEGRATED 
Tyumen is now eyeing natural gas, angling to up its Kovykta stake and in 
Rospan, with 600 billion cubic metres in reserves. 
Kukes sees gas as part of a strategy to develop Tyumen on the lines of Enron 
- producing crude, gas and power. 
""Gas is an essential component of a vertically-integrated oil company and in 
the way we see ourselves in future,"" Kukes said. ""We aim that in five years, 
10-15 percent of our revenues will come from gas and condensate."" 
But aggressive expansion has brought Tyumen into conflict with competitors. 
It has locked horns with arch-rival Interros to wrest control over a stake in 
Kovykta, and its role in oil firm Sidanco - where BP owns 10 percent - has 
been criticised. 
""We'd like to get at least 25 percent in Kovykta,"" Kukes said, noting Tyumen 
was keen for BP, which has a 31 percent stake, to remain project leader. 
Tyumen also angered influential gas trader Itera by trying to obtain control 
over its bankrupt gas producer, Rospan. 
""Rospan is a profitable firm but for some reason was losing money,"" Kukes 
said, adding Tyumen would turn the company around.

COMMODITIES & AGRICULTURE - Enron Metals to pay fine to LME.
By ADRIENNE ROBERTS.

07/18/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron Metals Limited - formerly MG - has agreed to pay a #190,000 fine to the 
London Metal Exchange after EML's systems and procedures for ensuring 
compliance with the exchange's rules were found to be ""seriously inadequate"". 
With the exception of hefty fines imposed after the Sumitomo copper scandal, 
this is the largest sum an LME member has yet paid. Fines for procedural 
shortcomings over the past four years have been between #20,000 and #90,000.
EML is charged with ""persistently"" failing to ensure warrants needed to 
settle exchange contracts reached the London Clearing House by the required 
time. This happened between August 1999 and February this year. 
The LME said EML's actions had jeopardised confidence in the exchange's 
delivery mechanism, a key aspect of its business. 
The exchange also found that between May 2000 and February 2001 EML 
repeatedly failed to enter trades into the exchange's matching system 
correctly. 
In both cases ""EML frequently provided explanations that were either 
inadequate to explain the particular incident, or inadequate to explain the 
persistence of that type of incident"", said the LME. 
Enron Metals, formed after Enron's purchase of UK metals trader MG last June, 
said the disciplinary charges related to ""operating procedures during a 
period prior to, and the first months immediately following, Enron's 
acquisition of MG"". 
The company added that Enron had now ""implemented a series of measures to 
tighten up existing procedures and ensure that the operating systems meet 
with Enron's high standards"".

THE London Metal Exchange (LME) has fined Enron Metals #190,000 for breaching 
its compliance regulations. 
The exchange said Enron Metals, a subsidiary of the American-owned energy 
giant, failed to meet deadlines for delivering warrants needed to settle its 
metals exchange contracts.
Warrants denote the ownership of LME-registered metal stored in warehouses. 
The group also failed to input trades into the LME's system, the exchange 
said. 
Enron stated that the charges related to its recently-acquired MG metals 
trading division before and immediately after the purchase. The group has 
since ""tightened up existing procedures"", it said.

Exxon Mobil, U.A.E. Min Discuss Dolphin Gas Proj - Report

07/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is interested in participating in 
the $4 billion Dolphin Gas project, a plan between the UAE Offsets Group and 
Qatar Petroleum to transport natural gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, 
the official Emirates News Agency, or WAM, reported Wednesday. 
An Exxon Mobil official and the U.A.E.'s Foreign Minister, Sheikh Hamdan bin 
Zayed al-Nahyan, discussed the issue Wednesday, WAM said.
The Dolphin project aims to transport two billion cubic feet a day of natural 
gas from Qatar's offshore North Field to the U.A.E. 
In May, Enron Corp. (ENE) sold its 24.5% stake in Dolphin back to Offsets, 
freeing up its share for another potential strategic partner. Enron's role 
would have been to focus on the midstream part of the project, or gas 
transportation, which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
TotalFinaElf SA (TOT) is Offsets' other strategic partner, holding a 24.5% 
stake in the project. The company will operate the upstream phase of the 
project, which includes developing natural gas reserves in two blocks of the 
North Field. 
The first wells are scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and 
come onstream in 2004. 
Since Enron's withdrawal, Offsets has said it is talking to a handful of 
international oil companies about potential participation. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin signed an initial agreement for the upstream 
section of the project in March. A full production sharing agreement is due 
to be signed in September. 
In the short term, it is expected the gas will be supplied to Dolphin by 
Mobil Oil Qatar's Enhanced Gas Utilization Project at the North Field.

I wanted to give you the latest figures on Enron expatriates in India.  There 
are currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by 
six dependants.  In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate 
contractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol.  The total of 
40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by 
location as follows:  21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda.  By 
company, they are broken down as follows:  Enron India -  eight plus three 
dependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; EBS - one plus two dependants; 
DPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine.  These figures are likely to continue to 
trend downward; Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce 
the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants.

We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best 
possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the 
event of danger.  As a contingency, the plan also includes the evacuation of 
all 137 expatriates working at the Dabhol site, although a large-scale 
evacuation from Dabhol is more problematic, especially now that the monsoon 
season has started.  A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number 
of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by 
individual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same 
resources.

As you know, Enron's security situation in India remains stable.  We are in 
the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and 
offices there.

California crisis. Davis is facing two issues. Sign the current rollback bill 
that is going through the legislature and upset the energy industry, or veto 
the bill and have many voters upset at him. Governor Davis is aware of the 
upcoming elections for members in his party, as well as the 2002 governor 
election and knows that his decision may cost himself and other members of 
his party election wins. Also, there is now talks that during August 21st PUC 
meeting the governor will suggest rate rollback for San Diego  to July 1998 
rates. This is a complete 180 degree turn from his August 3rd PUC meeting 
where he said he would steer clear of rate rollbacks or freezes and push for 
only a rebate.

order to allow  ""a more sufficient state role.""  This was drafted per 
sign-off from our conference call with Steve Kean, Joe Hartsoe and Dan 
Watkiss yesterday plus drafted with the buy-in from numerous attorneys 
representing various stakeholders with NARUC being the essential 
participant.  The staff and stakeholders meet again early Monday morning to 
determine if this agreement is sufficient to meet the needs of Congressman 
Barton so we can proceed to mark-up.  If this proves the case, we will need 
to immediately also lobby the other provisions which need amendment, but have 
been held at bay until the transmission language loggerhead we created is 
removed.  The plan would be to determine on Monday the ""go"" vs. ""no go"" to 
full Commerce Committee mark-up.  With an affirmative decision, the mark-up 
would proceed at round-the-clock, record pace with conclusion completed by 
Thursday, July 27th.  We will continue to advise you of the status.

As an aside, with Congressman Largent comparing this effort to a ""Hail Mary"" 
pass; he said this with optimism.  And for you football fans, with the 
Congressman having been one of the best receivers in the country; our odds 
are better than they would have been otherwise.  Perhaps this is like 
numerous state efforts before which were pronounced ""dead"" but resurrected 
for enactment at the final hour.

With the comprehensive bill activity, the stand-alone reliability bill 
viability will not be considered until September, if at all.  This bill's 
Savings Clause ""new"" agreement failure also makes bill movement problematic 
as does the agreement we achieved from all the Stakeholders to share our 
position to block its movement.  We have drafted a letter to the Speaker

I won't be able to make the call on Monday.

I'd be happy to volunteer not to be on the negotiating team.  It sounds
like there's no shortage of people who want to be on the committee.

My big issue is default service.  This industry needs real customers and
the only way to get real customers is to get rid of default service.
Starting with big customers, along the lines of the core/non-core gas
model, is the best way to go.  The only way to sell this, however, is to
get the big customers to agree it's a good idea.

1688,"I attended both the House and Senate energy committee hearings today.  House 
hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).  Senate 
hearing was on last week's FERC order on a ""soft price cap"" and related 
issues.  The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal 
Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation 
Implementation Task Force.  In addition, there were witnesses from the 
Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.  The Senate witnesses were the 
three FERC commissioners.

HIghlights

Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton 
bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will 
happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will 
report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); 
Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.
There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that 
higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate 
increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation 
costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at 
the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical 
conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as 
it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country 
attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.
The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, 
attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism 
was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high 
price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell 
it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus 
sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their 
strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA 
testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region 
to support sec. 102.
Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a 
price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among 
the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could 
be done; the witnesses just said ""cost plus a reasonable profit"" and said 
leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had 
the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would 
take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last 
week's soft price cap is much better.
Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to 
admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT 
have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken 
recently. 
The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it 
was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when 
Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that ""help is on the way"" in the form 
of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that 
suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern 
came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat 
contentious at times.

1689,"I wanted to give you the heads-up that Enron's name will appear in a Wall 
Street Journal article tomorrow on multipollutant.   

As I have discussed with most of you before, we have been working in a 
coalition of companies (temporarily named the ""Clean Power Group"") including 
El Paso, Trigen, Calpine and NiSource to develop legislative proposals on 
multipollutant emission reductions from the power generation sector.   The 
group has hired Dutko Group lobbying firm to help float some of our initial 
ideas in the Administration and on Capitol Hill.  Mark Irion of Dutko spoke 
with John Fialka at WSJ today and discussed some of our concepts.

Background -- we have developed ideas that focus on making emissions 
reductions in NOx, SO2, mercury and CO2 in exchange for regulatory reforms to 
the New Source Review program.  We have structured these proposals in a way 
that holds multiple benefits for Enron -- promoting development of new 
generation, providing incentives to use new technologies and a diverse fuel 
mix, and environmental benefits with economic protections.  This is also an 
issue of competitiveness, as the big, regulated utilities with high-emitting 
grandfathered sources are trying to mold these issues in a way that would 
disadvantage new entrants.  We have had very positive discussions with many 
in the Administration and on the Hill, and are hoping some of our ideas are 
embraced in energy task force reports, legislation, etc.   

Note on CO2 -- the multipollutant debate has changed somewhat since Bush took 
CO2 caps ""off the table"" for the U.S. power sector.   We are not forwarding 
ideas that say ""we must include CO2 caps"", rather we are saying we can do 
multipollutant effectively and economically -- if policymakers want to 
include CO2, we can show them how to do it without causing economic collapse.

We plan to discuss this issue in more detail with many Corp and commercial 
groups at our Emissions Strategy Meeting, which now looks like it will be 
held on May 18 in Houston.  Please let me know if you have questions or need 
additional information.

1 e. Suspend or relax the RACT (""Reasonably Available Control Technology"") 
adjustment requirements to promote the creation of cleaner air and ERCs.  
Example:  When we were having difficulty in finding ERCs for Pastoria, we 
realized that there were quite a few operating gas turbine projects in Kern 
County.  We developed an agreement with GE, because the projects all had GE 
turbines and GE serviced them, to approach the owners of the projects and 
offer to retrofit new emissions reduction technology in exchange for an 
attractive business deal.  The appropriate technology is Dry Low NOX (""DLN"") 
which reduces NOX emissions from permitted levels of ~25ppm to <9ppm.  To our 
surprise, since these reductions are ""RACT"", per present Clean Air Rules we 
can get credit only for reductions below 9 ppm.  Maybe that is intellectually 
OK, but the shocker is that there is now in Kern County no requirement to 
reduce emissions to RACT standards.  So, they keep polluting at 25 ppm...   
We have the same concern with the cement plant initiative we are taking, 
mentioned in item 1.d.  We are working with the largest single source of 
pollution in the SF Bay Area to retrofit it with SCRs, which if successful, 
will reduce emissions by >1000 tons per year, enough for at least a 1000 MW 
plant.  However, there is a plant in Germany just starting up with SCRs.  We 
are concerned that air officials here will become aware of that plant and 
""RACT adjust"" any emissions reductions we may get.  I will tell you if that 
happens, the plant will not make the retrofit as the economics simply do not 
work and they will continue to pollute......  You can mention in public the 
Kern County example, but please do not breathe a word about the cement plant 
initiative.

Thanks for the quick turn-around.

The positions we have in the Qs and As have been used for 2 years -- in India 
by Sanjay, Europe, US, everywhere!!  Many people, including Rob B. have seen 
these positions.  Rob's central concern is with respect to the science ( a 
position which I do not argue and STRONGLY believe that Enron should not 
argue since we are not scientists and have no general interest in getting 
involved, as a company, in scientific arguments).

The positions articulated in the Qs and As are good for Enron's commercial 
ventures which I am heading and I believe Rob has nothing to say about what 
Enron staff are doing to pursue their parochial commercial interests; this is 
a pure business decision.  This intrusion to shape positions that benefit the 
Sutton-blessed business would be strongly resisted by me.

continues to explore opportunities to serve the residential market and we 
believe that the market presents opportunities that were not available even a 
couple of years ago (for example, the  rising acceptance of online purchasing 
by consumers presents low cost customer acquisition and account management 
possibilities that didn't exist when Enron last moved into residential

Ken - Though a mutual acquaintance, my CV has been provided to Bob Zoellick, 
in the hope and expectation that he might become USTR, and with an interest 
on my part in being nominated to be one of his deputies.  I am writing to 
seek any support and assistance you feel comfortable in providing in this 
effort.  I attach a copy of my CV below.  I would particularly call attention 
to the fact that I served in the Department of Energy as a Deputy General 
Counsel in the administration of the first President Bush.  While I obviously 
could not contribute much time to the campaign given my current assignment 
within Enron, I did contribute financially.  My wife and I gave $2,000 to the 
campaign to fund the primary effort, $2,000 for the General Election, and 
another $2,000 to the Compliance Fund.  I also wrote letters seeking funds 
(using your fund-raising number), and while I do not think the response rate 
was high, I do know that at least some of the people I wrote to did 
contribute.

I have discussed this interest in the Deputy USTR role only with Steve Kean 
and Richard Shapiro within Enron.  I expect that if Bob is nominated in the 
next few weeks, that I will be making a trip to Washington to meet with him, 
as part a trip associated with some other US business.  (And if Bob is not 
the USTR, I will, of course, remain interested in the role.)  When it is

1741,"The Hearings
The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like 
environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility 
witnesses.
The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship.
The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E 
witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices 
since restructuring started in 1998.
Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for 
investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g., 
dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and 
parent's use of that cash for investment activities).  
Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the 
utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from 
parent, bankruptcy).
The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward 
PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings 
progress.
Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by 
Edison witness.
Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to 
issue its decision on Thursday.
At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed 
the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general 
ratemaking authority.

Outside the Hearing
Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management 
continue.
Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities 
inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain 
some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room.
Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with 
utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any 
rate increases.
Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission 
absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor 
follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of 
the state speech on the 8th.",,,PG&E ALJ Commission the Commission/Administration

I can confirm that Jim Bannantine and Diomedes Christodoulou have resigned 
from Enron to pursue other interests.  We wish them well in their new

several months ago, so the transition at Enron South America is already

Don't squat with your spurs on.

Good  judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad  
judgment.

Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin'  it back in.

If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every  now and then to 
make sure it's still there.

If you get to thinkin' you're  a person of some influence, try orderin' 
somebody else's dog  around.

After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he  started 
roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him... The  moral: 
When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.

Never kick a cow  chip on a hot day.

There's two theories to arguin' with a woman. Neither  one works.

If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop  diggin'.

Never slap a man who's chewin' tobacco.

It don't take a  genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep.

Always drink upstream from the  herd.

When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't  be 
surprised if they learn their lesson.

When you're throwin' your weight  around, be ready to have it thrown around 
by somebody else.

The quickest  way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in 
your  pocket.

Never miss a good chance to shut up.

There are three kinds  of men. The one that learns by reading. The few who 
learn by observation. The  rest of them have to pee on the electric fence

1776,"With the first round of RTO filings and responses complete, it is a good time 
to step back and review the highs and lows that occurred in 2000 and lay out 
our plan going into 2001. 

A. 2000 Key Facts --

1. FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS.

It does not appear that FERC (in its current form) will modify its standing 
policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let 1,000 
flowers bloom.  While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a 
different position, we have seen no signals that anything will change.  Faced 
with this policy, as the initial RTO filings made clear, almost all utilities 
are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic 
transmission assets.  Accordingly, most of the proposed RTOs do not remove 
the fundamental problem - the Native Load exception.

2. THE MIDWEST CAN'T MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST.

The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO.  The three big 
utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd, 
IP, and Ameren (probably 40% of total load in initial MISO).   Key problems 
for the MISO include (a) MISO's not-for-profit status (key IP claim), (b) 
parties interest in taking energy east (key ComEd need), and (c) fair 
retention of 3rd party wheeling revenues (Ameren want).    Meetings with 
regional stakeholders (public power, industrials, State PUCs) have been 
productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred 
option, however we await action from the FERC.  MISO is also telling everyone 
that can listen that if the big three pull out, it probably won't continue.  
While the MISO process is very open to the public (not so with the Alliance 
RTO), neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the 
details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met.

3. SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED - NOTHING.

Rather than take a major step forward, Southern and Grid South (SCANA, CP&L, 
Duke) have initially filed non-compliant RTOs.  Grid South does nothing to 
advance a market, much less provide transmission service in a 
non-discriminatory fashion.  In fact, Grid South simply takes the current 888 
OATT and ""combines"" the three utilities for wheeling through purposes.  

4. PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERC'S SHINING LIGHT.

PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was 
necessary (rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the ""right 
example"").  PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order 2000 in 
that filing.  PJM is also expanding.  So far, Allegheny Power and DQE have 
agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called 
PJM West.  In terms of market coordination, PJM has been publicly reluctant 
to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools (PJM, 
NYISO,  NE-ISO, and Ontario IMO).   The other pools are not getting very much 
accomplished in their efforts.  For example, NE-ISO has indicated that it 
won't have the Day-Ahead market ready until 2003 at the earliest.  

5. ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME.

ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail 
access (pilot program beginning next summer).  The rules are still being 
structured.  We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines don't 
overwhelm good market structure.   Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading 
our efforts and are very active.  

6. SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG

In a surprise move, the actions so far in Grid Florida, while certainly not 
perfect, appear to be moving in the right direction.  The FL PSC has gone 
from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right.  
Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during 
this Legislative session; Enron will be involved.

B. 2001 Steps - 

1. FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION.

FERC will have new leadership some time in early 2000 (if we can get a 
President).  Enron is developing a coordinated political plan (Capitol Hill, 
media, Administration, industry allies) to impress upon the next 
Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue 
to drive wholesale market reforms.  Without a stronger mandate, it may prove 
difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of 2001.  More importantly, it 
will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail 
wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight.  In those RTOs 
that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception, no 
amount of meetings or filings will change the parties.

2. COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK.

It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to 
ensure that Enron's objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs.  
The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to 
coordinate day-to-day activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no 
opportunity is missed.  This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs 
of the commercial teams.   We continue to have at least one person dedicated 
to each RTO market.

SPP  - Ron McNamara
ERCOT  - Robin Kittel

Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out.  
Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June / July to also work on wholesale 
market issues.

3. PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS.

NE-ISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January 
15, 2001.  While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration 
matters, not much progress has been made to date.  Moving power between the 
pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling 
rules.  FERC is aware of these problems.  Again, FERC has not done anything 
to mandate compliance with Order 2000.  We have deployed an additional 
resource in Houston recently to help support Enron's involvement in the tight 
pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all 
developments as close to real-time as possible.

4. CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES.

The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for 
ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO.  We continue to 
advocate our agenda (to anyone that will listen).   This work is time 
consuming (much spent listening to ""junk"" from monopolist Transmission 
Owners) and detailed.  Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs 
initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our 
resources.

5. FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT e-trans.

Project e-trans has resulted in a new business consortium - 
etransconsortium.com.  This combination of APX, Cal PX, and Alstom ESCA has 
developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the ""market 
front-end"" for any RTO (e.g., day-ahead market, transmission exchange, 
etc.).  Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates 
our policy objectives.  We are now turning our attention to finding the right 
Grid Operator.  We are in discussions with National Grid, American 
Transmission Company, MISO, and PJM (although they may want to do something 
very similar).  The goal remains the same -- to have a fully functioning 
entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use 
this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action.  I will be taking 
a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in 2001.

6. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION 
DIVESTITURE

Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets 
through direct access and divestiture.  It will take (1) non-discriminatory 
transmission access, (2) retail choice, and (3) generation divestiture to 
enable a fully thriving wholesale market.  Of course, additional market 
openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California.

I hope this helps put some framework around our activities.  If anyone wants 
to discuss this in more detail, I'd be happy to meet individually or as a 
group.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
? California's Bond Inevitability
? Davis Faces Even Greater Financial Woes
? California's Creditor Status Debated by Court
? Windfall Profits Tax Bill (SB 1X/AB 128X) Passes Senate Vote, Davis 
expected to Sign Off

California Bond Battle
SB 31X passed the Senate today by a simple majority vote, initiating the 90 
day wait period on the revenue bonds issuance.  Sources indicate that 
contrary to media reports, a possible referendum on the SB 31X would be 
unlikely for Harvey Rosenfield to produce within 90 days due to insufficient 
funding.  He reportedly would need to raise $250,000 - $500,000 very 
quickly.  Sources believe that it is more likely that Harvey will attempt to 
set up an initiative later this year or in 2002.

Davis Financial Woes Just Beginning
It is unclear whether Governor Davis truly will be able to move money around 
within the state budget to cover power purchases until August.  Of the $13.4 
billion bond amount authorized, approximately $6.7 billion has already been 
spent on power.  It is likely that the state will spend more than the 
remaining $6.7 billion on power before the bonds are even issued.  Sources 
indicate that most of the long-term contracts Davis talks about are unsigned 
and not really in place.  This means that the state may still have to 
purchase the majority of power on the spot market, which further complicates 
the situation.  As reported earlier, this explains why the Republicans wanted 
to wait for Davis to disclose the terms of the contracts before authorizing 
the bond issuance.  Given the lack of contracts in place, it appears that the 
bridge loan and the bonds will be inadequate for all of the state's power 
purchases.

""To Be or Not to Be,"" Is California a Creditor? 
Sources indicate that lawyers and members of the generator community 
reviewing California's revenue bond bill SB 31X, are unclear as to whether 
the state of California has claims as a creditor.  It appears at this time, 
that the Assembly re-wrote Senator Bowen's language so that the bill relies 
on the existing interpretation of AB 1X as to when the state gets paid by the 
utilities.  This exact issue is currently being reviewed in the PG&E 
bankruptcy case and will most likely settle this ongoing dispute between 
legislatures and utilities.

Windfall Profits Tax
According to sources, the windfall profits tax bill, SB 1X, still remains in 
committee in the Assembly.  It is unclear if this bill could be brought to a 
vote tomorrow given that each house has not reviewed the other's version of 
the bill.  Sources further indicate that the Senate version SB 1X, has not 
yet been referred to an Assembly policy committee and that a ""significant 
reconciliation process"" between the two bills must occur.  For example, 
unlike the Senate version, the Assembly version reportedly does not set a 
price cap based on a firm dollar amount, but instead leaves the decision up 
to a regulatory committee such as the PUC.  Once the bond issuance passes the 
Senate and is officially authorized, the state will likely be able to get its 
bridge loan from the lenders.  However, sources indicate that the bridge loan 
is ""dead"" unless the Senate moves before Thursday.  ","Kristin Walsh Britt Whitman   Davis Davis

Bingaman, Senate Energy Chief, Will Block Bush Plan (Update1)

     (Adds company names in fourth paragraph and details about
contributions in paragraph 23.)

     Washington, June 5 (Bloomberg) -- President George W. Bush
delivered his energy plan to Senator Frank Murkowski last month,
expecting the Alaska Republican to push it more or less intact
through the Senate and on to passage by the House.
     Now the package intended to boost oil and gas production and
ease some pollution controls is in the hands of Jeff Bingaman. The
New Mexico Democrat disagrees with Bush's approach and wants to
start fresh negotiations on what U.S. policy should be.
     Bingaman, 57, who's spent most of his 19 years in the Senate
out of the spotlight, will become chairman of the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee when Democrats take control of the
Senate later this week.
     Bush wants to make it easier for companies like Enron Corp.,
Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc, to build power plants and pipelines
by easing regulations, and he's opposed to regulating the carbon
dioxide emissions blamed for global warming. Bingaman has
introduced legislation to cut emissions to curb global warming.
     The president's proposal to drill in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, in trouble even with Republicans in charge, is
dead as long as Democrats have control. Bingaman has no plans to
consider it.
     Bush opposes caps on energy prices; Bingaman is cosponsor of
legislation to impose caps on wholesale energy prices in
California although, according to a spokesman, he'd prefer the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission do that on its own.

                         Seeking Consensus

     Bingaman says rather than offer his own plan now, he'll try
to sit down with Republicans and negotiate something both sides
can agree on. There is already agreement on some proposals, such
offering tax credits to encourage domestic drilling and the use by
business of renewable energy technology, such as wind-powered
turbines.
     ``Obviously, I'm going to work for consensus,'' he said.
``There's nothing about much of these issues that should be
partisan.''
     Bingaman says he hasn't decided whether to push a single,
comprehensive energy bill or move issues separately. Democrats may
insist on separate bills for political purposes, said Tim Evans, a
senior energy analyst at IFR Pegasus.
     ``They'll say, `Let's get all of the most vulnerable
Republicans on record supporting drilling and see if they get re-
elected,''' he said.
     Whatever his decision, Bingaman won't meet Murkowski's goal
to have a bill for Bush to sign on July 4.
     ``I'm not anxious to have some artificial deadline so that we
can have a bill-signing ceremony on a holiday,'' Bingaman said.
``I don't think that's the way to legislate.''

                     Visionary or Do-Nothing?

     Throughout his career, Bingaman has made a practice of taking
time to study an issue before acting.
     ``He's something of a visionary,'' said Bruce Black, a former
law partner who became a federal judge in New Mexico after
Bingaman recommended his nomination. ``He sees trends.''
     Opponents see inaction.
     ``He doesn't accumulate much in the way of negatives by not
doing much,'' said John Dendahl, chairman of the Republican Party
of New Mexico.
     Bingaman is a politician who doesn't stray from party
positions, Dendahl said. ``He's not a maverick. He's always been
when the chips are down a straight Democratic voter.'' In 2000,
Bingaman voted with the party leadership 87 percent of the time on
votes in which the two parties took opposing positions, according
to data compiled by Congressional Quarterly.

                        Fundraising Success

     In the Senate, Bingaman's strategy has been to home in on
issues that have been neglected, such as school accountability and
defense research that has civilian uses, work with others, and not
hog the credit.
     ``He wouldn't try to beat it to the front of the class,''
said Ben Alexander, a Bingaman fundraiser.
     That approach appears to have worked: Republicans haven't
been able to budge Bingaman from his Senate seat by appealing to
New Mexicans' distrust of party-line politicians.
     With Alexander's help, Bingaman built a campaign fund that's
helped him fend off rivals. He raised $2.7 million for his 2000 re-
election bid compared with his Republican challenger's $669,000.
     The $295,527 Bingaman got from oil and gas companies and
electric utilities made him the industry's sixth-largest
congressional recipient in last year's elections, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics.
     The oil and gas industry gave $32.6 million overall last year
in campaign contributions. The top contributor, Enron, a pipeline
and energy-trading firm, gave $2.4 million. Exxon, the world's
largest publicly traded oil company, followed with $1.4 million
and BP, the third largest publicly traded oil company, donated
$1.3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

                     Comparison With Murkowski

     Environmentalists said Bingaman will balance conservation and
production concerns better than Murkowski.
     ``Murkowski wants to jam through an agenda'' to boost
production, said Alyssondra Campaigne, legislative director of the
National Resources Defense Council. Bingaman ``tends to be more
studious and thorough.''
     As chairman, Murkowski has pushed a comprehensive bill that
includes tax incentives to promote the use of alternative energy
and opening 1.5 million acres of the 19-million acres of the
Alaska refuge to oil and gas exploration.
     Bingaman has proposed leasing land in the Gulf of Mexico for
oil production, and that concerns environmentalists.
     ``It would put too much at risk in coastal resources,'' the
NRDC's Campaigne said.



USA: TECO breaks ground on 599-MW Arkansas power plant.

06/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - TECO Energy subsidiary TECO Power Services held 
a groundbreaking ceremony Tuesday on its 599-megawatt natural gas-fired power 
plant in Dell, Ark. 
Actual construction on the Dell Power Station began in March, the company 
said in a statement.
One megawatt provides enough electricity for about 1,000 average homes, 
therefore the Dell plant will provide enough electricity for about 600,000 
homes. 
National Energy Production Corp. (NEPCO), a subsidiary of Houston-based 
energy giant Enron Corp. , is building the plant. 
The Dell plant, along with a sister plant, the McAdams station in Kosciusko, 
Miss., are designed to interconnect with the Entergy transmission system. 
Both will sell electricity to wholesale customers in the Southeast and 
Midwest, TECO said. 
Dell is expected to begin commercial operation in the second half of 2002. 
Tampa, Fla.-based TECO Energy units include Tampa Electric, Peoples Gas 
System, TECO Transport, TECO Coal, TECO Coalbed Methane, TECO Propane 
Ventures and TECO Solutions. TECO Power Services have announced projects to 
serve customers in 18 states, spanning the southern half of the U.S. 
TECO Energy has ownership in nearly 11,000 megawatts, operating, under 
construction or in advanced stages of development worldwide.

 the FIs take over DPC to avoid prolonged negotiations on a settlement that=
 would be necessary if a private Indian promoter were to step in. So far, B=
SES and Tata Power have evinced interest in taking over DPC, but their offe=
r prices are said to be too low. The FIs, on the other hand, are keen on an=
 early settlement as they have a huge loan exposure of over Rs 6,200 crore.=
 Should the FIs take over the company, they are expected to warehouse the p=
roject before selling it to a private buyer. This is expected to take at le=
ast 90 days.=20

Any prospective private sector buyer would need at least a month to underta=

 at least another 30 days to make an open offer and another month to close =
the sale with a private bidder or the State-owned National Thermal Power Co=

Sources say of the $1-billion-plus exposure claimed by Enron in DPC, Enron'=
s equity exposure -- along with its US partners GE and Bechtel -- is $800 m=

Please forgive the delay.  I was having trouble with my PC again (we have a 
replacement in the works).  We are discretely investigating this group a bit 
more, but the general conclusion is that they may be a front for one of the 
opposition groups.  We are preparing counter arguments for the general 
public, but do not see much value in opening a dialogue with this ""group.""  
We always have had opposition and we can expect that socialists etc. (some 
groups have boasted that they will storm the DPC fences on March 1) will 
begin to rally using us as a scapegoat for Maharashtra's financial 
difficulties.  At present, we are getting balanced press and I fear that any 
explanation/outreach to the most vitriolic opposition will be used against 
us.  I am available to discuss this at your convenience.

1810,"Steve,

Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the 
length)

Political
One of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its 
""benefits"" for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy 
policy.  Subsidies should be focused to the consumer.  In general, 
electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized.  If there is 
a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government 
finances, that is, if you do not raise the rates for the residential users 
(especially for the poor).  In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they 
plan to do with the subsidies, but if they make a mistake it will become a 
social problem.  I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the 
advice of economic experts.

Economic
Another way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform 
benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways:

1.  Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will 
enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized 
world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local 
economy.  Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence 
enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower 
inflation rate.  A growing industry creates more employment...

2.  Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the 
most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back 
of the government's finance.  The government could then re- direct resources 
that it would have invested in the energy sector or use resources from the 
sale of assets to develop water infrastructure, pay foreign debt, give micro 
credits, build roads, improve health and education,.....

Social development (poverty)
There are another aspects that are directly related to the availability of 
energy services for the poor:  heating and cooking and water

Although most of the developing world has tropical or semi tropical weather 
and is less subjected to cold weather (hot weather generally will not kill 
you) they have some heating needs apart from the energy for cooking needs.  
It is frequent that dung is used as fuel for heating and cooking purposes 
with terrible effects on health which in turn results in lower productivity , 
etc.  The available alternative to dung is wood and here the problem is even 
worse because these poor communities end up causing irreversible damage to 
the forests and then to the soil and finally to their water resources (since 
the forest sustains the soil and prevents water from causing erosion.  When 
the forest dissapears water is not filtered down to natural storages 
underground) As you can see its a mess.

One other extremely important aspect of the availability of energy for the 
poor is that it enables them to have potable water delivered as close as 
possible to their communities.  In the poorest communities little girls do 
not go to school because they have to carry the water buckets home.  They do 
not get an education.  The terrible thing about it is that the education 
level of the mother is what can have a highest impact in the quality of life 
of a poor family.  This is very sad and energy plays a huge part in the 
solution.

A lot could be researched and written on this matters and about the role of 
energy in the solution of these problems.  Can we  help?  Do we have the 
resources that need to be commited to at least one of these aspects?  Which 
one do you think will have the highest impact?

Best,

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing
broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

1861,"Louise,

I spent time today and this past weekend surfing the web on ""meritocracy""/""meritocracy and management"" etc.  Therefore, using different phrases to capture the following information :
benchmarks for meritocracy
relevant managment issues related to meritocracy, and 
meritocracy within a large firm.

Overall, I was disappointed by what I found.  Seems that everyone has their own perspective on meritocracy and much is not related to business (i.e. - how it relates to the domestic educational system, SAT tests, diversity, etc.)  Anyhow, I aggregated information that I felt transferred most to the Enron culture and attached some slides at the end of your presentation. No pride of ownership, edit at will.

I plan on stopping by a bookstore tomorrow evening.  I have to film our PRC video today.

Do you remember Chou? (my dog)  You're never going to believe this...but she
turns 18 on January 3rd.  I think she found the fountain of youth somewhere
and never told me about it. but told the other animals...the rabbit's 8 1/2,
2 of my birds are pushing 9yrs, etc.  (little lovebirds...I think 9 yrs is
really unexpected for them...guess the birds aren't aware of that. :) )

If you hadn't told me what Enron does, I wouldn't have ever known.  I've
never heard of them.  Are they local to Houston?

Very cool that you and Patrick (Pat?) were set up on a blind date...proof
that those work sometimes!  Well, believe it or not, I still have a little
bit of Xmas shopping to do, so I better go.  Talk to you soon.

1884,"we will agree to cancel these trades and reconfirm new ones.








Tori,

Please disregard my prior email - I mispelled Socal's email address.  Their
address is now correct.

As we discussed, Astra incorrectly confirmed the two imbalance trades
detailed below.   Tony at SoCalGas said he can cancel the trades if Astra
and Enron send him an email requesting the trades be cancelled.

1888,"It sounds like I need to clafify my plans for trading and risk management of 
power in Ontario.  

1.  Garrett is in Toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to 
understand all the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including 
building forward curves.  He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the 
Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the 
Northeast U.S.).  Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for 
Ontario.  

2.  My current opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto 
office with risk management responsibilities rolling into Dana.  This could 
always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.

3.  John Mckay, although he has been helping Bill out, will ultimately have 
no power trading responsibilities.

4.  Tom May is the cash trader in N.Y. reporting to Dana.  I expect us to use 
Tom's expertise with respect to Ontario to build up our competency there, 
however, Toms' main role will be N.Y.

5.  Garrett should spend some time (probably soon) in Houston getting to know 
the people and the technical resources available to him.

1889,"John, I've been meaning to drop you a note to say thanks for the golf
weekend, but things have been a little crazy since I've been back.
Shannon's mom passed away last Wednesday, so I was on a plane to Thunder Bay
within a couple of hours and up there until Sunday night.

It was great seeing you, Dina, Michael and Rich.  He's a great kid (Michael,
not Rich).  Please give my thanks to DIna again.  By the way, are you
missing a car key?  I just unpacked my golf bag and there was a key chain in
the golf travel bag with a BMW key on it.  My intuitive mind tells me that
the key is probably yours.  Give me your mailing address and I'll send it

Deal Update:

Las Vegas:  Meetings and site visits scheduled with Northland, Black Hills and Allegheny.  All have registered a lot of time on Dealbench.  Northland brought there investment bankers (CIBC) to Portland and hired an independent engineering firm.  We will have the info memorandum prepared this week tosend out to other potential purchasers if necessary.  Still on track.

AMPS: We are negotiating with two industrials, each can take the first two units.  Oregon Steel in Portland and Geneva Steel in Utah.  Geneva is a better site (permitting and infrastructure).  High elevation in Utah will derate the output of the units, but will likely be able to run most hours.  Oregon interconnects with Portland General (good) but permit will restrict hours (3,500 hours estimate).  We need to talk this week to discuss the form of the contract and value/risk transfer between ENA and AMPS.

Wind:	We completed a term sale to Edwards Air Force Base consisting of shaped energy and green tags.  Tags came from our existing biomass tags and Texas wind.  We will purchase the balance from Pacificorp.  We expect more activity here with other feds, some of the munis and 6-7 developers that we are working with.

Generator Tolls: We are trading term sheets with Allegheny, Reliant, Idacorp, Dynegy, NRG and Constellation re our offer to sell at NP-15, Mid-C and Palo - I think we will get something done this quarter.

Longview: We met with the head of BPA this week and got confirmation that he supports our Longview process and that his agency will not slow us down with their proposed regional air study.  Finding EPC contractors has been difficult so we may start discussions with NEPCO.

DWR: Should execute the Master agreement this week which will allow short-term deals with 7 day payment.",Pastoria Jacoby tosend Dynegy Longview,3.5MM 5MM 5.3MM 39MM 10MM 7MM 3.7MM 2.1MM 1MM 69.5MM 64.5MM 20MM 15MM 67MM 131.5MM,SubTotal Dealbench Oregon Steel Geneva Steel Portland General ENA AMPS Idacorp BPA EPC NEPCO DWR

With respect to the PPA reserve.

We need to adjust the USD reserved based on the currency.  We decided not to hedge the currency when we took the reserve.  Its hard to make an objective decision on whether this is correct or not.  However, the currency was 1.5 CAD to 1 USD when we did it and now 1.565 CAD to 1 USD so the reserve would be 287.5 USD not 300.  We should just adjust this weekly or monthly.

excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his 
education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where 
intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person 
to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, 
within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a 
young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both 
working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their 
honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to 
Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It 
was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
ENRON CORPORATION

Dear Dr Lay,

While it appears that the US economy is moving towards the much-talked
about 'soft-landing', there are nevertheless imbalances - particularly the
severe shortage of labor and surging trade deficit - which have given
global business leaders reason to be wary. Add to this scenario the new
political landscape, and the recent hike in oil prices, and there is every
reason to pay close attention to the USA in early 2001.

Taking place within the first 100 days of the new Administration, the USA
Meeting 2001 will bring together key members of the cabinet and
congressional leadership, several hundred chief executives from over forty
countries, as well as renowned experts and media leaders. In our usual
Davos-style interactive discussions, we will analyse the current state of
the world's largest market against the backdrop of the global economy.

Held in collaboration with the National Chamber Foundation, the USA Meeting
takes place at the headquarters of the US Chamber of Commerce, across from
the White House. The Meeting is widely recognised as the premier Washington
event for business leaders from the United States and around the world.

A full brochure will be sent to you after the election but wanted to take
the opportunity to inform you at this early stage so you can already block
April 4-5, 2001 on your agenda. I hope that I will have the pleasure of
welcoming you in Washington, DC next April, and look forward to hearing

Although I have every confidence that we will recover, could I respectfully ask that employees be given a daily update on what steps are being taken to reverse the trend that the company is in?  I realize that you and your team are diligently working to correct it, but I believe it would help morale if employees could hear on a more frequent basis specifically what our management is doing.

Mr. Lay, 
I am a former employee of Enron and have been through many trials in the past few years. God has been faithful and seen me through them all. Dear sir, I can tell you that I can count it all joy. I just want to encourage you. These look like very dark times right now. Call upon the name of the Lord. Throw yourself on the mercy and grace of the Lord and remember all that he has done. He is a BIG, GOOD God that LOVES you! His arm hasn't been shortened that He cannot help you. 
You will be glad to know that the true testimony of you as a man is of a good report. You will glorify God in this. I am listening to a song right this minute that I so wish you could hear. It would bring you such comfort. It is based on the verse that talks about ""all of my help cometh from the Lord"". How true that is for you. 
Lord Jesus, you are a good God that sees all things. Mr. Lay is a man of God. That means he is your child. You tell us that you are an ever present help in time of trouble. These troubles are over his head but under your feet. Lord Jesus, show yourself strong on his behalf. Glorify yourself and Mr. Lay will give you the glory. He knows, Lord. Help him in this time when the waters are flowing over his head. Hear him from where you are. We are all but dust. Who are we that you are mindful of us but you tell us in your Word that You have good thoughts and plans for us and they are for good and NOT EVIL that we may have an expected end. (Jer 29:11-For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.) Who can stand except you give us grace? Lord, you are so good. Remind Mr. Lay of who you really are. In the mighty name of Jesus!

Mr. Lay, get some scripture to hang onto-write it down on a card and carry it with you. When things come against you (the enemy), you will need to remember who you are in Jesus! The greatest battle on earth was fought with the Word of God (Satan against Jesus in the wilderness)!
Isaiah 54:17-No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.
Oh Mr. Lay, one more thing. I am telling you that I haven't a clue as to what has or has not been done. I just want to show you something from the Word of God how God is. If you will read Isaiah's calling in Isaiah 6 and read Moses' calling in Exodus 3, you will see that God DOES NOT mention their sin to them. Isaiah was just overcome with the glory of God and confessed all by himself and Moses (remember he had killed an Egyptian) was just trying to convince God that He had to be wrong. The ONLY reason I mention it is because sometimes we delay in going to God because we think we have done something wrong. God tells us that He hasn't dealt with us according to our sins. KNOW that NO MATTER WHAT, Jesus is ready to fight on your behalf! It is ALWAYS about God's SPIRIT and not our strength. 
When I started this email, you were just a stranger. You are now my beloved brother in Christ. Isn't it amazing how God works. He has knit my heart to yours. I will be on my knees for you. Phillipians tells us to pray for E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G! What does everything mean? EVERYTHING! God's gonna do some amazing stuff so get ready!!!! His ways aren't our ways and remember too-He is able to do EXCEEDINGLY ABOVE what we can ask or think!

1949,"We are looking forward to having you at the video taping we are doing for the 
Management Conference.  We will be taping at Houston Studios on Thursday, 
October 19, from 4:00-6:00 p.m.  As mentioned in our earlier e-mail, we want 
the atmosphere to be comfortable, so we ask that you dress casually, or at 
least take off your suit coat, loosen your tie, roll up your sleeves and 
relax.  It would be best if you did not wear a white shirt, as it tends to 
wash out on video.    

Please try to get there as close to 4:00 p.m. as possible -- even a little 
before would be great.  We'll have someone ready to apply a little make-up 
and get you miked.

Directions:  The studio is located at 707 Walnut Street.  To get there from 
the Enron Building, take Clay to Main Street and make a left onto Main.  Turn 
right on Texas, and left on San Jacinto.  Turn right onto Wood Street which 
will dead-end and you will have to take a left onto Walnut.  The building 
will be on your left and the entrance is located in the middle of the 
building.  There is visitor parking in the front.

The phone number of the studio is 713/223-0951.

If things change on your schedule and you cannot make the video shoot, please 
let me know as quickly as possible.  It will make a difference in how we 
frame the shot, so it's important that we have advance notice.

We look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

This Company is setting the standard for affordable security in the lucrative Small to Medium Enterprise (SME) arena.</I>

            <p>Cyber-terrorism - A Very REAL Threat<br>
            Merilus is helping agencies and corporations protect themselves against the increasingly ominous threat of ""cyber-terrorist attacks""
            - breaches in network security that allow criminals to steal files and documents via their computers and the Internet. Merilus' leading-edge products
            give the piece of mind necessary to operate safely in a dangerous world.

<p>The NEED for Security<br>
Now more than ever, companies need to ensure their security. The Computer Security Institute, in conjunction with the FBI,
recently released a report stating that attacks on corporate computer systems have been increasing steadily since 1998.
A report issued by the American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) and PriceWaterhouseCoopers found that Fortune 1000 companies lost $45 billion to theft of proprietary information
last year alone, with fully 90% of this proprietary data being in digital form. Merilus provides hardware and software to effectively deal with the problems of network security, and delivers these solutions at a tremendously attractive cost
to its customers.

<p>Aggressive Marketing Strategy<br>
The Company has spent the past 4 years concentrating its efforts on intensive research and product development.
Merilus now has in production a number of fully tested and independently verified products. The Company will now be shifting its focus to an aggressive business development, marketing and sales expansion.
Early response to Merilus' worldwide business development activities has been very positive, and the Company is working towards establishing a worldwide presence.

<p>Leading Customers & Esteemed Awards<br>
Merilus is proud to have its products in place at some of the world's strongest companies and organizations. Lockheed Martin, NASA, and the State of Vermont
are just a few of the customers who are putting their trust in Merilus. InfoSecurity News Magazine
recently awarded Merilus its prestigious 5-Star rating, and The Tech Zone called its product ""a truly powerful combination of hardware and software,"" giving the product a score of 9.5 out of 10.

<p>A Powerful Bottom Line<br>
Merilus currently shows a 60% gross margin in their Small to Medium Enterprise (SME) hardware business, and an astounding 95% gross margin in their software business.
The Company's unique 2:1 cost feature ratio ensures that competitors cannot defend existing market share without drastically affecting their bottom line.  The Company projects sales of approximately $7.9 million in 2002, and is projecting revenues of $93.7 million by 2004.
By that time, Merilus expects to be cash flow positive and projects earnings of approximately $0.19 per share.

<p>An Attractive Investment Opportunity<br>
Merilus Inc. (OTC/BB: MERH) is well positioned to expand its position in this lucrative niche market. The aggressive sales and marketing expansion
will represent a tremendous opportunity for the Company and its shareholders. At this critical juncture in Merilus' development, it is a perfect time to consider MERH as a part of your portfolio.

uityAlert.com.     SpotLife Announces Agreement with Yahoo! Mail; Create, S=
end and View Video E-mail through Yahoo! Mail   SAN MATEO, Calif., Nov 26, =
2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SpotLife, the leading provider of integrated person=
al video solutions, and Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), a leading global communi=
cations, commerce and media company, today announced an agreement to offer =

 The addition of video e-mail services will enable users of Yahoo! Mail to =

y and colleagues virtually anywhere in the world.   ""SpotLife's technology =
provides a significant value-add to the Yahoo! Mail service,"" said John Wal=
sh, CEO of SpotLife. ""Video e-mail offers Yahoo! the ability to provide the=
ir users with easy and reliable video e-mail capabilities, while ensuring t=
hat Yahoo! Mail maintains a superior service offering, and the best Interne=
t video technology available on the market.""   Under the agreement, SpotLif=
e will provide video e-mail technology and service for Yahoo! Mail. The ser=
vice enables Yahoo! Mail users to easily record video with a PC video camer=
a, or upload video already existing on their PC. SpotLife's technology auto=
matically compresses and uploads video messages to SpotLife's servers, elim=
inating the need to store large digital video/audio files on the end-users'=
 PC. Recipients of a video e-mail receive a notification message containing=
 a link to a Web page on Yahoo! Mail where the customer can readily view th=
e video through the SpotLife Player. The videos are composed and sent direc=
tly from a Yahoo Mail user's existing account, and managed and stored by Sp=
otLife. Whether consumers are using broadband or dial-up connections, the v=
ideo e-mail service works with any Internet connection speed. All that is r=
equired to create and send video e-mail is a PC with the Windows operating =
system, an Internet connection, a PC video camera (or other video source) a=
nd a Yahoo! Mail account. Recipients of Yahoo! Mail video e-mails need only=
 a Windows media player to watch video e-mails sent from Yahoo! Mail.   ""We=
 believe this new feature will provide Yahoo! Mail users with a unique new =
way to communicate with family, friends and business associates,"" said Lisa=
 Pollock, director of Messaging Products for Yahoo!. ""Our agreement with Sp=
otLife further supports Yahoo! Mail's strategy to continue to develop and i=
ntegrate innovative, new features that add real value to people's lives. We=
 are also pleased to provide even more effective marketing services by offe=
ring rich media ads through this new feature.""   The demand for Internet vi=
deo technology continues to increase dramatically. Based on IDC Forecasts, =
approximately 60 million PC video cameras will be sold by the year 2005. Th=
is represents a significant market for the adoption of video e-mail service=
s.   ""Video e-mail is a great way for friends and family to keep in touch i=
n an uncertain world,"" said Chris Chute, analyst, Worldwide Imaging Group, =
IDC. ""The continuing popularity of PC cameras and adoption of new technolog=

***********************************************************

Wall Street City's Stock Search of the Week

1.  Screening for Stocks That May Top Expectations

The primary focus of this earnings season will not be so
much on how companies performed during the fourth quarter,
but rather what their 2002 guidance is.  Valuation levels
for many stocks have risen materially over the past few
months on the anticipation of an economic rebound occurring
this year.  In order for these valuation levels to be
sustained, earnings will have to show a dramatic improvement.
Those companies that issue better than expected earnings
results and guidance may be the ones to receive the most
favorable attention from investors over the coming the
months.  Stocks With Rising Earnings Estimates That May Top
Expectations identifies such companies.

The search strategy is built around two key criteria - a
streak of at least four consecutive quarters of positive
earnings surprises and a recent upward revision in the
earnings forecast for the current year.  The first criterion
establishes that a precedent exists for the company to top
expectations, while the second criterion suggests that
business conditions have continued to improve.  Combining
these two criteria results a list of companies that are
continuing to thrive in the current climate and have a track
record of beating analyst estimates.

Using the two criteria by themselves would result in a
limited list of stocks, but to improve the validity of the
search, we added four additional criteria.  Earnings
estimates from a minimum of four analysts were required to
limit the skewing effects of one overly bullish analyst on
the earnings forecast for the current year.  Four quarters
of revenue growth was required limit the results to only
those companies that increasing the topline and not just
relying on cost-cutting measures to improve profits.
Similarly, requiring a sequential positive change in
revenue between the previous two quarters, suggests that
the sales growth curve has not been reversed by the
recession.  Three-week relative performance of no less than
80 percent was required to eliminate those companies may
have dropped precipitously over the past few weeks -
precipitous drops suggest that sentiment is against a
positive earnings announcement.

The strategy is designed for both active traders and
long-term investors who are looking for investment ideas.
The strategy can be used as often as on a daily basis, though
it works well when run on a weekly basis as well.

OPT-IN EMAIL SERVICE
TRADE ALERT #13
CEPHEID / (Nasdaq - CPHD)
May 31, 2001
09:45AMET - emailed to TFR Trade Alert Subscribers

NOTE - DELAYED DELIVERY: This information was previously distributed
to Fagan Report Trade Alert Subscribers at the above noted time and
date. Due to ever-changing market considerations - it may or may not
be applicable at this time.

TRADE ALERT #13 - Speculative Buy / Cepheid / (Nasdaq - CPHD),
currently trading at $3.50 with a target above $6.00 and a stop-loss
at $2.89.

Cepheid (CPHD), based in Sunnyvale, CA, is developing and
commercializing versatile, miniaturized instruments that perform all
the steps required to rapidly analyze genetic material found in
complex biological samples -- sample preparation, amplification, and
detection. Integrating proprietary microfluidic and microelectronic
technologies. It is commercializing products initially for DNA and
RNA analysis in clinical diagnostics, life-science research,
agriculture, industrial testing, and pharmacogenetics.

Not many stock speculators can decipher the above paragraph, but if
you go to www.cepheid.com it all begins to make sense. Cepheid is
making it possible to do complicated, critical compound analysis on
site in vastly reduced time frames. The range of applications is
almost unlimited. It can help detect the spread of cancerous cells
during a surgical procedure. In agriculture, it is being tested to
identify the spread of Pierce Disease in the California grapevine
industry. I looked up Pierce Disease and found the following:

Pierce's disease infects grapevines, effectively choking the tissues
that deliver water and nutrients throughout the plant. Infected ines
usually die within a few years. The disease has been present in
California at relatively low levels for decades, but is cause for
heightened concern because the glassy-winged sharpshooter (insect),
newly arrived from the southeastern U.S. and northern Mexico, can
spread it much more rapidly than native insects.  - SACRAMENTO,
Calif., May 16, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Cepheid (Nasdaq:
CPHD) today announced that its Smart Cycler(R) TD System is being
exhibited for early detection of Pierce's disease in grape vines at
today's 13th annual California Association of Professional Scientists
(CAPS) State Scientists Day held at the Capitol. Using the portable,
real-time gene-detection system, for the first time scientists can
detect the lethal disease before symptoms appear, allowing vintners
to remove infected vines earlier in the growing season before the
disease is spread by insect carriers.

Situations like this have the potential to catch the imagination of
the market.

CPHD went public in June 2000 through an IPO (led by VSB Warburg) of
five million shares at $6.00. A further 20.5 million pre-IPO issued
shares became free trading in December 2000. Presently, there are
25.5 million shares issued. As of March 31, 2001, cash on hand stood
at $37 million - current liabilities $5 million. Based on published
information, I estimate FY01 revenue of between $15 and $20 million,
with a net cash burn of $12-$18 million. FY02 is where sales and
profits should start to improve. CPHD's 52-week high/low stock price
is $27.50 / $2.97. What I like about CPHD is its cutting-edge
technology in what is likely to be an in-vogue market sector.

Recent Economic Reports Mostly Quite Positive
 Economy Bouncing Along Bottom - Confidence Recovers
 Our View Remains - No Recession, Second Half Recovery

*Q1 GDP revised downward to +1.3% - Prior week's report
*April Personal Income rose +.3% - Spending rose +.4%
*May Consumer Confidence rose to 115.5 from April's 109.9
*Jobless Claims up +8,000 to 419,000 - Four Week
  Moving Average drops -1,500 to 402,500
*Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index for May 38.7 -
  Essentially unchanged from April's 38.9
*April Construction Spending rose +.3%
*Nat'l Assn. of Purchasing Managers' Index eased to 42.1
  From April's 43.2
*Labor Department Employment Report
 - Unemployment Rate eases to 4.4%
 - Nonfarm Payrolls fell -19,000
 - Average Hourly Earnings rose +.3% to $14.26
 - Average Workweek rose +.1/hr to 34.3/hr


Virtually all the recent economic reports have been quite
good, implying economic conditions are not getting worse,
and setting up the economy for a recovery later this year.
However, we are still concerned that the FOMC (Federal Open
Market Committee) may have been too aggressive, so we still
believe that inflation risks are greater than consensus
expectations.  But near term, the outlook is improving.

Perhaps the ""key"" report was the fairly good gain in
consumer confidence for May.  As most of you know, consumer
spending drives approximately two thirds of economic activity.
Our view has long been that if consumers have confidence,
and the wherewithal, they will spend.  Both conditions are
currently positive, and while we would be the first to admit
that one report is not a trend, it is nonetheless an
encouraging bit of information.

In addition, it also has implications for FOMC policy. As
we have noted several times, the FOMC was worried about
consumer confidence, driven by a negative ""wealth effect.""
We have never been big believers in the ""wealth effect"" -
negative or otherwise.  But the FOMC believes, and that's
what counts.  However, if consumer confidence continues to
hold up, then the FOMC will likely be less aggressive in
lowering rates.

While the labor market is still clearly soft, the improvement
in the unemployment rate and the positive revisions to recent
data suggest that deteriorating labor market conditions should
not erode consumer sentiment.  However, all was not positive
in Friday's Labor Department report.

Consider the following year-over-year comparisons of increases
in average hourly earnings.

Jan '01  4.00%
Feb  4.21%
Mar  4.35%
Apr  4.25%
May  4.47%


This looks very much like a trend to me, and is the primary
reason that in my opinion consensus inflationary expectations
are too low, as productivity ""gains"" during the first quarter
were non-existent.

The point I had made in earlier issues, in my opinion, remains
valid, and worth repeating.  The FOMC is making a very, very big
bet.  And that bet is that they can jump start economic growth,
and that productivity growth will pickup sharply as economic
growth resumes, and that reduced pressures in the labor markets
will moderate gains in unit labor costs.  In my view, this is a
lot that has to go right - with almost perfect timing.

It's not that I don't think this scenario won't play out, it's
just that my concerns are that it won't play out perfectly.  My
forecast remains for a second half recovery continuing into 2002,
and that should reignite productivity growth.  But, economic
growth of 3.0% may only produce productivity gains of, say 2%.
And, if pressures in the labor markets don't abate, as the
economy recovers, inflationary expectations will rise.

In short, near term the news remains positive as the probabilities
for economic recovery improve.  But, risks remain in my view -
just not the risks most investors are worrying about. Stay tuned !

In addition, bids are due from prospective shippers on Friday February 2 for 
the 400,000 MMBtu/d block of east to east capacity with alternate rights to 
the California border.  The alternate west pricing is based on a sharing of

Title: Taking up the Slack
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1415 ,

Alternative URL: 
http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111000_11/nag_alt_111000_11_ab.html

Cold weather in the Midwest and reduced storage
injections have taken up much of the temporary slack
that developed in the gas market during the warm
October. As expected, prices have responded quickly to
the cold, with the December futures contract price
advancing by over $0.75 per million British thermal
units (MMBtu) in the past week. As cold weather
develops, late winter supply availability is still
uncertain in CERA's view. For that reason, dual-fuel
markets must remain off of gas, and market fundamentals
support the recent price rebound, which places gas
prices again at a premium to resid.

CERA estimates that US working storage inventories as of
the end of October were approximately 2,746 billion
cubic feet (Bcf), an all-time low for that date by 64
Bcf (see table below). Storage injections of 36 Bcf for
the week ending November 3 were higher than a normal
weather pattern would indicate, but more normal weather
for the remainder of the month would result in
withdrawals averaging 3.5 Bcf per day during November.
This withdrawal rate is moderate by historical standards
but 2.5 Bcf per day higher than occurred in the past two
years (see table below). This pace of withdrawals places
inventories on a path toward an end-of-March minimum of
771 Bcf under normal winter weather conditions, only 13
Bcf above the previous all-time low.

This market remains tight. Although added supplies will
begin to help by the end of the winter, for now some
demand must still be priced out of the market in order
to preserve storage inventories.

2071,"This project, of all that have been proposed recently, probably has a better 
chance of success.  First, Mission Energy is already a huge player in the 
IPP/Cogen business in Kern County, and is regarded as fairly skilled at 
getting permits/authorizations through the system.  Their existing facilites 
on Texaco's leases currently produce over 1,000 MW of power.  Secondly, this 
project would sit smack dab in the middle of the Midway-Sunset field and is 
easily accessible off the West Side Lateral of Kern/Mojave's system.  As 
such, they are probably a prime candidate for either Phase I or Phase II of 
Kern River's expansion.  Also, realize that Texaco has a substantial amount 
of field area [associated oil] gas, so, depending on the structure of the 
Texaco - Mission Energy sales agreement, Mission probably has access to or 
call on this Texaco production (i.e., they have the perfect physical hedge).

Kern would seem to be the ""pipeline of choice"" here... particularly, when you 
consider the impact of the reduced rates under their proposed expansion.  
Without the direct connection into Kern County, TW would have a difficult 
time competing.   Also, keep an eye out for El Paso moving forward with 
commercial plans for the California leg of All American Pipeline.  A large 
end-use plant like this could be the basis for an ""En-Rate"" type transport 
program on El Paso-All American, particularly if they get their allocation

ENRON INVESTMENT PARTNERS' BIGGEST GAMBLE TO DATE HAS BEEN THE $4 MILLION IT 
pumped into Cynet. The software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs 
in to a laptop or PC and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and 
data-messaging. That may not sound like much. But imagine e-mailing thousands 
of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded 
message to tell folks to check their fax machines. Cynet is also developing 
the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to 
translate voice mail into e-mail.

The investment helped launch Cynet as the first African-American company to 
go public out of Houston. How's it doing? Not so hot. After the initial 
offering in January the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in April and 
now hovers around $1. It has yet to recover. 

Still, Enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million. 
Cynet holds the exclusive North American marketing license for Teleran 
Electronic's wireless modems. That's got to be worth something. Compaq

2105,"We have been working hard over the past three months to restore normalcy to the non-debtor companies in the EGS family of asset-based businesses.   We are doing our best to operate on a business as usual basis, and continue the regular, consistent programs we previously provided.  That is why earlier this year we paid performance bonuses and merit increases to most non-debtor employees, in the ordinary course of business. 

At the same time, I understand that events of the past few months have been disturbing and left many with a sense of uncertainty about their future.  We realize that you need some sort of ""safety net"" to allow you to be comfortable staying here as we work to reorganize.  With this in mind, I am pleased to inform you that we have put in place a severance plan for U.S. employees of certain non-debtor companies.  We have wanted this program for some time, but even as a non-debtor company we had to work extensively with consultants and creditors in securing its approval.

The severance plan provides that, under most circumstances, terminated employees would be eligible for two weeks of base pay for every full or partial year of service.  In the case of a termination due to reorganization, the minimum compensation would be eight weeks of pay and the maximum would be fifty-two weeks.  The details and restrictions to this plan are explained in the plan summary for your company's plan, which can be found on the ETS HR link on the Enron Transportation Services intranet site under ""ETS HR Manuals"". It can also be accessed by clicking on the attached weblink:  http://hrweb.enron.com/businessUnits/ets/etsHRmanuals.asp . 

I hope this plan will give you a bit more peace of mind and allow you to continue the excellent work you have been providing in our ongoing businesses.  Please contact your HR representative, if you have any questions about the severance plan or related matters.

	Following up on our meeting today, I need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our Sun Devil Project.  How much (if any) can I discount the fuel charges for Sun Devil shippers, based on the following assumptions, 

Project cost $911mm
Include all compression adds/mods from Doug Cebryk engineering scope dated 9/28/01
Incremental Volume MMBtu/d: 780,000 San Juan, 810,000 Mainline, 500,000 to Phoenix, 310,000 to Cal Border
Of 1,520,000 total capacity to Cal Border and 500,000 to Phoenix, assume 390,000 has to come from East of Thoreau
Assume load factors in 10% increments from 50% west flow up to 100%.
Assume fuel collection of 5% from shippers

In theory, we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for Sun Devil, and the new compressors at stations 1-4 are more efficient, then the actual fuel use should be less.  Please verify this for the load factors above.  If we can keep the same net fuel retainage, but collect less because our actual fuel use is less, then this is a win-win for both TW and the Sun Devil shippers.

Is an answer possible by Tuesday 11/12?

2120,"I have had a casual chat with some of my accounts regarding their opinion of 
the market dynamics affecting the Needles to Topock price differentials.  
Each customer focused more on the supply side dynamics of Topock gas 
supplies, rather than the incremental intra-state transport costs required to 
transport to the PG&E citygate, as the primary driving force for the Needles 
to Topock  price differential.    

Here is a recurring theme I heard from my customers:  The El Paso Merchant 
Service (EPMS) 1.2 BCF contract's Block II capacity (500 MMcf/d of Permian to 
PG&E/Topock capacity,  $.065 transport rate) has a re-callable aspect.  If 
EPMS schedules gas under the transport of Block II capacity to any other 
California delivery point other than PG&E/Topock, then other parties may 
recall the capacity for their own use to PG&E/Topock.  Currently Duke has 
recalled 100 MMcf/d and PG&E Energy Trading has also recalled 100 MMcf/d for 
their use to transport Permian gas to PG&E/Topock. (FYI - EPMC may re-recall 
this capacity, but they have elected not to).  These additional Topock 
supplies coming from Duke and PG&E Energy Trading under Block II capacity may 
be viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to PG&E at Topock.  This gas 
competes head to head with Malin gas prices.  For example, today's Malin 
price is $4.62 while PG&E/Topock price is $4.69.    Today's cash price 
differential between Needles and Topock is $.60, far larger than the 
previously assumed $.28 differential resulting from the intrastate cost 
required to bring Topock gas to the citygate.    

If anyone else had additional market information or opinions regarding these 
market dynamics, let's discuss further at our next staff meeting. CS

The last ""capacity available"" analysis that I provided the group assumed that Red Rock would bring on 120,000 MMBtu/d of new West of Thoreau capacity beginning June 1st. Currently, construction delays are expected to result in 80,000 MMBtu/d being delayed until June 15th and 40,000 MMBtu/d being delayed until July 15th. Attached is my current estimate of West of Thoreau capacity available for June-August. Note that if we wanted to begin transport for our contracted shippers on June 1st, we would be short of needed capacity by 57,298 MMBtu/d June1-15 and 17,298 MMBtu/d July1-15. We need to discuss how this impacts our marketing strategy for June-August capacity.

1.  Creating a Cunningham/Maddox connection directly from the Linam plant:
Dave Engbrock (303-308-6002) would have more information on this idea in
terms of volume and rate commitments.

2.  Increasing the CIG/Tumbleweed interconnect capacity from 40,000 to
60,000:  During the summer, e prime flowed up to 15,000 from CIG into TW's
PEPL Pool;  if this capacity were expanded, we might be able to get more
supply off CIG.  The problem we had this summer was that at times the
capacity was reduced to 25,000 due to operational reasons, and that was not
enough room for all shippers.  Any additional supply that e prime brings in
from this area will most likely go to shippers who already have firm
transport to California, or e prime may be interested in shipping this to
the Waha area.

2143,"This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

1.  There is a central desk vacation calendar on my desk by the sun machine - 
it is a little black date book.  Please put any future requests in there so 
that we can keep track of who needs off when.  I would like to try and keep 
from having more than 3 people out at a time.
2.  Physical gas daily options - when booking these, please be very careful.  
These need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly 
swaps.  This will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader 
at gas daily as opposed to mid.  This is very important to avoid OA variances.
3.  When booking deals in sitara, please look at your swaps when they are 
created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price.  This is 
important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and I 
notice last night on a gd option, that the swap did not come at the correct 
gd curve.
4.  I am going to set up a mtg. for friday or monday to discuss OA, the 
process and how to prepare forms.
5.  Please take advantage of time that you can spend with your traders.  All 
the traders have expressed their approval for each of their book admins to 
spend a morning watching them trade to better understand why they take the 
positions that they do.  The only request I have had is that we sit there

Muse: Bowden 'panicked' after Lowder told him his job in jeopardy
The Associated Press
3/18/2001 
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- When Auburn's football fortunes took a turn for the 
worse in 1998, trustee Bobby Lowder told coach Terry Bowden that he would not 
be retained after the season, former university President William Muse said. 
When Bowden resigned on the eve of a game that fall, he said he was 
essentially fired. 
""Basically, Mr. Lowder told him he would not be around come the end of the 
season, and coach Bowden basically, in my opinion, panicked when he was told 
that and came and negotiated out of his contract,"" Muse said. 
More Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers Forum
Muse said Lowder did not consult with him before speaking to Bowden, whose 
team was off to a 1-5 start. Bowden said Thursday that Lowder actually did 
not speak directly to him, but went through athletic director David Housel. 
""That's how David and I worked,"" Bowden said Tuesday in a telephone interview 
from his Orlando home. ""We would meet and he would tell me what Lowder wanted 
me to do. I felt like I could do everything I could do and it wouldn't be 
enough (to save his job)."" 
Muse made his comments to faculty members March 15. A transcript of the 
meeting was made public Tuesday by Auburn officials. 
Muse said he was unable to reach Bowden until ""the wee hours of the morning,"" 
then told him that Lowder didn't have the authority to fire him and ""urged 
him to stay until the end of the season."" 
Muse said that was ""the most celebrated case"" of Lowder taking such a direct 
role in athletic decisions, but ""there are many others."" 
Bowden often commented that ""Mr. Lowder hired me"" and that the coach had 
""regular contact"" with the powerful trustee, Muse said. Bowden said he spoke 
with Lowder ""weekly, if not daily"" during his first two or three seasons, but 
""never felt it was a situation that he would tell me something and that I 
should do it."" 
Muse said Lowder did not hand-pick the coach. He said an eight-member search 
committee, including Lowder, voted unanimously to offer Bowden the job in 
1993. 
""Let's just say I would not have been hired if Bobby Lowder had not wanted me 
hired,"" said Bowden, now a television commentator with ABC. ""There's no doubt 
about it. Bobby Lowder controlled the committee that hired me at Auburn."" 
Both Lowder and Housel have denied Bowden's contention that he was told his 
coaching fate was all but sealed. They also denied that Lowder was pulling 
the strings on that decision. 
Bowden ""always believed ... that the only way he got that job was because of 
Lowder's influence,"" Muse said. ""So he believed very strongly that he had to 
maintain that relationship."" 
Muse said that relationship began to sour when Bowden fired longtime 
defensive coordinator Wayne Hall. 
Muse also said he is not sure what Lowder's relationship is with Bowden's 
successor, Tommy Tuberville, but that he believes basketball coach Cliff 
Ellis has ""very, very frequent contact"" with the Montgomery banker. 
Lowder was out of town and did not immediately return a call for comment. 
Earlier Tuesday he said in a statement issued by Auburn that the trustees' 
athletic panel he chairs will continue to provide ""support and input"" to the 
president and athletic director and that it's time to focus on positive 
accomplishments and ""stop bickering."" ",Bowden Lowder Auburn Bobby Lowder Terry Bowden William Muse David Housel David Housel Muse Wayne Hall Tommy Tuberville,,"Associated Press AP Muse Auburn Tigers Forum Bowden ABC Cliff

I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading

Here is a proposed correction to the first sentence of section 14.3 of the
agreement.

We had offered a 15% reduction in efficiency in our warranty. When we
changed efficiency to heat rate, we neglected to correct the percentage
change because heat rate goes up as efficiency declines. Mathematically,
there is an inverse relationship (see attached spreadsheet) which means that
the equivalent of a 15% reduction in efficiency is an 18% increase in heat
rate. Therefore we propose to change the Heat Rate reduction in the first
sentence of Section 14.3 (also attached) from 15% to 18% and correspondingly
revise the total change from 20% to 23%.

Number one priority is the amendment to the two letter agreements.  We are 
also trying to get the ABB and GE facility agreements finalized so they can 
be tendered to Intergen today.  

Meanwhile, on the TurboPark front I am revising the relevant documents so the 
drafts can be sent to the banks today.  Once the assignment and assumption 
agreement form is approved, it will need to be signed by GE.  This doesn't 
have to be done today.

We are also trying to get both the GE and ABB acknowledgement letters signed 
today.

though I took a very long shower.  Michael and Pal had a nice visit this 
morning.  Pal is still whining a bit.  I brought one of our puppy books to 
the office, and I'll sneak a peak when I can.  I did read about the up at 
night stuff, and it says that so long as you don't let them get in bed with 
you, the whining should stop pretty quickly.  I hope the resting on the chest 
didn't mess it up, but boy, was I desperate.  He did great using the grass 
when we got up.  He definitely knows why we go outside.

Kaley picked on him a little, but she was at her food bowl.  I set up the 
little crate where she can't look in it, so he has an escape.  We should walk 
the perimeter to make sure there aren't any escape routes.  We probably need 
to protect the air conditioner wires until he is old enough to train to the

Our counsel has provided these drafts of the project documents.  Please

to fund escrow and the actual transfer of funds.

I also want to mention that Enron initiated the additional purchase of Power 
System Stabilizers, which cost $31,675 per turbine.  PSS are required in the

2287,"FPL, Entergy Merge in $7 Billion Deal 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - FPL Group Inc., the parent of Florida Power & Light Co., 
said on Monday it would merge with Entergy Corp. in a stock deal worth $7 
billion to create the largest U.S. power generating company. 
The combined company would have a total enterprise value of more than $27 
billion, consisting of $16.4 billion in equity market capitalization and 
$10.7 billion in debt and preferred stock, the companies said. 
The merger is expected to immediately boost earnings for both companies. 
Under the terms of the agreement, FPL shareholders would receive one share of 
a new holding company for each FPL share held. Entergy shareholders would get 
0.585 of a share of the new holding company for each Entergy share. 
Based on the companies' closing stock prices, the deal would value Entergy at 
its market value of $7 billion, or about $30.89 per share. FPL shares closed 
Friday at 52-13/16, off a year high of 56-5/8 but up from a low of 36-3/8. 
Entergy stock ended at 30-5/16, off a high of 31-3/16 but up from a low of 
15-15/16. 
SHAREHOLDERS' APPROVAL REQUIRED 
The combination must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal 
regulators. FPL and Entergy said they hope to complete the transaction within 
15 months. 
``The merger combines two strategically aligned, financially healthy 
companies into an organization that has no equal in the industry,'' said J. 
Wayne Leonard, Entergy chief executive. 
Leonard will serve as president and chief executive of the combined company 
while FPL's chief executive, James Broadhead, will serve as chairman. 
The deal was billed as a merger of equals but gives FPL shareholders 57 
percent of the combined company and eight of 15 seats on the board of 
directors, the companies said. 
Once combined, the new company is expected to see annual cost savings of $110 
million to $150 million in its regulated businesses derived from eliminating 
duplicate corporate and administrative positions and programs. 
Competitive businesses should see annual cost savings and revenue 
enhancements of $40 million to $125 million and capital expenditure savings 
of $50 million to $100 million, the companies said. 
FPL and Entergy said they will seek to ``minimize workforce effects of the 
merger'' through a variety of unidentified efforts. 
In addition, both FPL and Entergy have authorized stock buyback plans, 
together worth $1 billion. FPL plans to repurchase $570 million shares while 
Entergy is looking to buy back $430 million in stock, the companies said.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are 
being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is 
available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be 
used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.

again that we focus on those particular items remaing in the agreement that 
may create incremental risk, and would lead to a worse risk rating in your

be sure that we get language in the agreement to mitigate those risks.  With 
your knowledge of the law and ability to craft language into the agreement, 
and my knowledge of the utility business and power trading, I think that we 
can improve most or all of these risk issues.  In addition, the MDEA deal is

nothing requires the municipality to do so either.

We've found no case law expanding on this statute. Thus, there is no clear 
answer whether obligations of CPU to Enron would be considered the kinds of 
expenses which may be paid. If a guarantee by CPU of the obligations of MDEA 
is insufficient,  then it may be worth raising this issue with David Hunt.

interests in one or both of the following project entities:

 Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.
 Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.

Based upon our discussions with Intergen this afternoon, there is a desire of 
both Enron and Intergen to execute the transaction documents tomorrow 
afternoon.  I need to determine if RAC believes that the 11/30/00 [Coral 
Energy] DASH is sufficient for the transaction signing to proceed tomorrow or 
if a revised DASH needs to be prepared and circulated for re-approval.

Relative to the approved 11/30 DASH, the major changes in the deal structure 
are as follows:

1.  At the request of Coral Energy, the counterparty to the proposed 
transaction has changed from Coral Energy to Intergen (or its designated 
affiliate, Sweetgum Energy L.P.).

2.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the removal of the 
requirement for an Intergen Parent Guarantee.  The major risk (i.e. 
non-payment risk) associated with the removal of this Guarantee has been 
mitigated by requiring Intergen to fund an escrow account with the 
transaction sales proceeds prior to Enron's execution of the equipment 
Assigment Agreement.

3.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the insertion of a 
""no-shop"" clause which serves to prevent Enron from offering/soliciting the 
turbines & transformers to other parties once Intergen has signed the Letter 
Agreement(s).

4.  Enron has requested, and Intergen has not yet agreed, to the modification 
of the transaction ""sunset dates"".  These are the dates by which, once the 
Letter Agreement is signed, that Enron must deliver the required Facilities 
Agreements, GE acknowledgement letter, and fully executed Assignment 
Agreement.  This modification proposes that the dates be moved from 12/29/00 
to 1/15/01.  The Enron commercial deal team is awaiting confirmation from 
Enron Global Finance that the executed Assignment Agreement can be delivered 
within these timeframes.

5.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to a modification of the 
Transferability section of the Agreement in order to address an equipment 
warranty risk that the current language represents to Intergen.  The 
modification would serve to limit Enron's ability to exercise its ""put 
option"" on its 20% member interest in the turbine/transformer L.L.C.(s) by 
requiring either: 1) the expiration of the GE warranty, or 2) the written 
consent of GE to Enron's ownership transfer in a form acceptable to Intergen. 
 This modification is acceptable to Enron as it represents an earlier 
potential put option exercise date under scenario 1) above than the current 
Agreement language.

Please review this information and let me know (via email) if RAC requires 
the DASH to be revised and re-approved.

Call me to discuss.

Wednesday, November 1, 2000 02:18 PM

	(Corrected 1:59 pm)
	
	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In response to new California power market rules 
proposed Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Enron 
Corp (ENE, news, msgs) has canceled some new generator projects it was 
discussing with the state's electric grid operator, Enron said. 
	The generators that are no longer financially feasible would have amounted to 
300 megawatts of new generation installed in California next spring, Enron 
said. The company, however, continues to negotiate other new generator 
projects with the California Independent System Operator. 
	The FERC Wednesday proposed limiting the California Power Exchange's price 
setting mechanism to $150 a megawatt-hour. The preliminary order could become 
a federal mandate by the end of the year, after the FERC takes comments from 
the public, or it could be modified. 
	Enron and 13 other companies, meanwhile, are in final negotiations with the 
ISO for the new peaking capacity for next summer. The ISO plans to pay a 
total of $255 million a year for three years to the power companies for 
installing the new generators, which the power companies will own. 
	In addition, California's three investor-owned utilities would pay the 
generators for any electricity the new generators produce. Pricing for the 
power would likely be based on the daily price set by the state-chartered 
CalPX. 
	""There's too much uncertainty that we would be able to recover the cost 
associated with those specific projects. For the purposes of making capital 
commitments, we view this as a $150 price cap,"" Enron's Mark Palmer said. 
	Earlier Wednesday, the ISO's chief operating officer, Terry Winter, expressed 
concern that FERC's proposed new rules could jeopardize some of the projects. 
	FERC's proposals Wednesday are the result of a two-month investigation of 
California's wholesale electricity market, where prices this summer were 
three times what they were a year earlier. To meet the state's rising demand 
for power, California's three utilities have paid billions of dollars more 
than anticipated to independent power producers in order to keep the lights 
on.

Our biggest concern is that the law firm seems to keep wanting to make the
document better, when they should just leave it the way it is.  We certainly
can see who pays them.

I've attached two documents below.  The first (SWPC-Enron-Agreement) 
summarizes my understanding of our verbal agreement.  Please review and let 
me know of any changes you recommend.  Since I will be in Orlando with 
limited e-mail capability, please follow up on any changes with a call to my 
mobile number (281-467-9599).  As a backup, you may leave a voice mail at my 
office number (713-853-3957).  If you're satisfied with the letter, please 
e-mail it back to me.  I'll have it printed on Enron letterhead and signed.  
Please also copy my assistant, Felicia.

I've copied Mike Miller on this e-mail.  Please copy him on any e-mail 
response, in case I can't access my e-mail from Orlando.

The second document (SWPC Letter) is a suggested draft of a letter intended 
to be sent by someone at SWPC to me.  The intent of this letter is to provide 
a document that we can provide to third parties without providing all the 
pricing details of our verbal agreement.

Things are heating up, no pun intended. Therefore, it would be helpful if you 
would prepare a closing list for the GE turbines moving out of WestLB.  I 
know it is short, but I thrive on lists.

I cannot tell you how many calls I've swapped with ABB's rep about that 
contract, without ever hooking up.  I see that we will be facing a fire drill

FOR
LIVINGSTON ENERGY CENTER (the ""Facility"")
TITAN LAND DEVELOPMENT CO., L.L.C. (""Titan"")
SOUTHEAST INTERSECTION OF 1400 N. AND 1700 E. ROADS (the ""Property"")


1. The operation of the Facility shall satisfy all Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency noise pollution requirements.

2. Titan shall enter into a roadway agreement with the County and
Township Highway Commissioners which assigns responsibility for repair of,
maintenance of, and debris removal on Township and County roadways during
construction of the Facility.

3. Contingent upon all property owners' written approval being secured,
Titan shall have installed at most four monitoring wells on at most four
properties within one and one-half miles surrounding the Property.  One
monitoring well each shall be installed on a property to the north, south,
east, and west.  Titan shall monitor well levels on each of the properties
on a quarterly basis and shall make such monitoring information available to
the County Engineer at his request for five years following issuance of the
final Certificate of Occupancy.  If no adverse impact due to the operation
of the Facility is found during the first five year monitoring period, then
Titan shall monitor well levels for each of the properties two (2) times per
year and shall make such monitoring information available to the County
Engineer upon his request for the life of the Facility.

4. The maximum number of power generating units shall be limited to a
maximum of ten (10).

5. Titan shall have repaired or replaced any drainage tile broken on
the Property during construction and operation of the Facility that would
adversely impact any surrounding property owner.

6. The site plan for the Facility shall allow no greater than forty
percent (40%) of the site's total acreage to be developed with
non-landscaped areas, open space, or agricultural uses

7. Upon permanent cessation of use of the Facility as an electric
generation facility, Titan shall remove all above ground buildings,
equipment, footings, appurtenances and structures, including accessory
buildings and equipment.

8. Titan shall make those stormwater improvements identified on the
attached Stormwater Management Plan.  Additionally, a) upon adoption by
Pontiac Township and Eppards Point Township of the Area-wide Stormwater
Management study prepared by Farnsworth & Wylie (the ""Study"") for the
Property and the surrounding area and b) upon written agreement to proceed
with the stormwater management improvements identified in the Study by those
property owners whose properties are identified by the Study as requiring
stormwater management improvements, Titan shall commit to make those
stormwater management improvements identified in the Study for the Property.
Titan shall provide a corporate guaranty to the County in the amount of
fifty-five thousand dollars ($55,000) with a C.P.I. as security for making
those stormwater management improvements identified in the Study for the
Property.  Titan shall construct such improvements contemporaneously with
other such improvements being completed in the Study area.

9. Construction of each phase of the Facility from initiation to
completion is estimated to require from six (6) to twelve (12) months
subject to weather constraints, acts of God, materials availability, strikes
and other labor issues, changes in regulations affecting development and
construction, and other constraints not within the control of Titan.  Within
twelve months following issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy all
improvements shall be completed and all construction equipment and trailers
shall be removed.

discussed, along with a marked copy reflecting revisions from the December
2000 escrow agreement between Enron North America Corp. and Sweetgum Energy
LLC.  Please review and advise of any comments.  Also, please consider
whether Citibank is willing to waive legal fees associated with setup of the

Timing is as follows:

Northwestern gives 30 days notice of readiness to close.  If the closing does 
not occur before July 16, they make another $5m payment.

10 days after notice, they fund the balance into escrow, and we close 20 days 
later.  

If they fail to close on or before Sept 1, they forfeit their previous 
payments, unless we have failed to provide the GE consent to assignment, 
which we are working on now.

I haven't written because I haven't figured out what we learned at the 
meeting.  We can discuss next week at our conference.  We are arranging to 
have Michael re-tested.  I think it is more of an issue of a difference 
between potential and performance.  Michael has been tested in the past, and 
tests as extraordinarily bright, but he has had some performance issues which 
don't match up.  At least that's how I understand it. He just has some 
disconnects which we are working to overcome, but I must admit to not 
understanding it all.

I left you a note about Michael possibly missing next week.  After I dropped 
him off this am, I had a thought that next week might be when they visit in 
1st grade, in which case we probably wouldn't want him to miss that 
opportunity.  I think he is excited about 1st grade, so you must be doing a 
great job of getting the kids prepared.

2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image

Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

2617,"
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.",,$1 billion an additional $200 million $3 billion more than $1 billion,JPMorgan JPMorgan Chase & Co. Salomon Smith Barney Citigroup Inc. Our Northern Natural Gas Company Transwestern Pipeline Company Houston Chronicle Enron Enron Updates

2627,"Appreciation: Congradulation to the IT team headed by Jeremy Wong and Francis 
Lim for the outstanding work in revising the Global Rates posting processes 
performed by Eduardo Calderon and Cecilia Cheung. As a result of the 
revisions the following is now possible:
CQG and Telerate is now a back-up for Reuters in posting daily settlement 
prices for options and futures for all commodities.
The revised spreadsheet is more user friendly with the ability to download 
prices immediately after settle prices are known.
Errors can be corrected without IT assistance.
Cross-checking vendors settlement prices for accuracy can be done without the 
usual delays.
Adding and revising commodity terms can now be performed by global rate 
personnel instead of an IT function.
Finally, end-users satisfaction has been improved to nearly 100%.

area ready for user testing. The reason for the new version is to incorporate 
three new requests. The new requests are as follows:

Provide ability to capture external exchange deal numbers and associate them 
with a TAGG deal.
For TAGG deals that have more than 9 legs,  redo numbering such that leg 
numbers on Deal Structure Screen match  with leg numbers in Deal Capture 
Detail screen and  forwards 
detail report .
For physical NG deals, require  a link to a Sitara deal num before allowing 
deal to save in TAGG.

The attached document contains more information regarding the external 
exchange item mentioned above.


The current plan is to migrate these changes into  production the evening of 
Monday January 22, 2001. If you have any problems with the changes made to 
this version of Deal Capture Application or with 
the proposed migration plans, please contact Oscar Rivera(x5-3361) or Sanjeev

In the past few months, Enron has received numerous requests from other companies to share some of the processes and systems that we have developed within HR.  Also, several new businesses have been created recently by consulting companies to pursue what some financial analysts believe is a huge untapped market in aggregating HR services.  Recently, we completed an internal review to consider what role Enron could play in this arena and have decided to explore some very specific external opportunities.  Due to the time commitment required to pursue these opportunities, we are assigning dedicated resources to this effort.  Effective immediately, the HR community will have three major areas of focus that will be working together in order to optimize HR transformation and commercialization.  Taking the lead roles will be myself, Mary Joyce and David Oxley (see below and attached chart).

?	I will lead this new effort in addition to continuing to lead those areas of HR that are our prime candidates for commercial opportunities.  Reporting to me on this commercialization effort will be:  Brad Coleman with the overall lead; Andrea Yowman who will focus on software applications such as PEP, Expertfinder and Global Compensation; Sarah Davis who will focus on Worklife; Elyse Kalmans who will focus on Community Relations; Cynthia Barrow who will focus on Benefits and Wellness; and Yevgeny Frolov and Dan Brown who will focus on E-learning and Talent Management.  I will continue to report to Steve Kean.

?	David Oxley will take the overall lead for HR across all business units focusing on continuing to increase the value HR brings internally to Enron.  The networked recruiting, Organization Development and Training and Business Unit Compensation consulting functions, the Global PEP team, as well as the generalist consulting responsibilities for all Corp. groups, will report directly to David. The HR leads for EWS, EES, EBS, ETS and EGAS will report jointly to their business unit OTC's and to David from a functional HR perspective. In this regard David will now report to Steve Kean.

?	Mary Joyce will add Global Information Management, Corporate Compensation services and Reporting/ Analysis, to her current Executive Compensation responsibilities.  Kathy Schultea, Felecia Acevedo, Cindy Ward and Suzanne Brown will report into Mary's organization. Mary will continue to report to Steve Kean.

?	With Drew Lynch's promotion to COO Metals and David's increased responsibilities, Robert Jones will take the HR lead for EWS Americas. Robert will report to the EWS OTC. Jon Chapman has been appointed head of HR for EEL, based in London, and will report to the EEL OTC. Both Robert and Jon will report to David from a functional HR perspective.

Additional realignment of resources will enable our team to further improve daily employee services, partner with Business Unit initiatives and maximize opportunities for commercialization.  These modifications are as follows:  

?	Scott Gilchrist will lead HR for the newly formed EGAS.  As such he will focus his attention on the asset positions in South America, Latin and Central America, the Middle East and Asia.  The European assets will continue to be a part of EEL.  Scott will also work closely with Rebecca McDonald and Sandip Mallick in relation to our assets in India.  Scott will report to the EGAS OTC, Rebecca McDonald and David as above.

?	Michelle Cash has agreed to take the lead of the Corporate OLER function for an interim period to determine how it should operate and be organized.  She will report to me for this particular function, but of course will remain primarily a part of the EWS legal function reporting to Mark Haedicke.  

?	Sheila Walton will lead the HR Generalist activities for all Corp functions.  Jo Ann Hill, and all of the corporate generalist functions currently under Jo Ann, will report to Sheila Walton.  Sheila will continue to report to David.

?	Sarah Davis will add the Click at Home program to her current responsibilities, and will continue to report to me.

We have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north. Right now 
Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule 12MW on the tie so do not try to 
schedule any more (The tie is only good for 17MW).

- Either do a export from SP15 to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at 
Silverpeak(From PV or FC).
- Buy transmission from SPP from  (www.swoasis.com ) CONTROL TO HILLTOP. 
($6.90 on-peak, $3.90 off-peak)
- Buy transmission from PAC from MAL2 TO MAL5. ($5.84)
- Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account 
numbers below).

We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin. 

THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY 
ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS 
SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. Call and confirm the request with both PAC 
and Sierra.



Also do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do 
not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I 
guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want 
competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they 
are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  

It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can.
If you have any questions over the weekend call me.

SPP - PAC: 853724

2689,"As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

was leaving tomorrow.  I miss him dearly.  Three to four years is going to be
a challenge.  In that time frame I must finish school and both of my daughters
would have graduated from high school and 8th grade.  The apartment was
bothering me on yesterday.  It was laid on my heart to call her and let her
know everything up front.  She had to run a credit report, you know that is
not good due to the circumstances.  I let her also know why I can not move
until March 1.  Emotionally I wish I could move Feb.1.  Financially I would be
set to move and start my new life of March 1.  I prayed about on last night
and turned it over to JESUS and I am not to worry about it.  I see the lady on
today.  My whole life will be on the move in the month of Feb.  If all goes
well I should receive the package no later than Tuesday.  Keep your head up
about the class.  If you need to pull Hunter to the side and work with him
personally do that.  May be L can help?  Beside missing RC I am okay.

As promised, here are estimated historical pricing for deliveries at the Nipsco city gate.  These prices are by no means, what we specifically charged at the time, but should give you an idea if this pricing is more competitive than the prices you have received in the past.  These prices also assume that you purchased gas at the First of the Month Index.  Please keep in mind that these sales prices are for deliveries to the Nipsco City gate, and you will need to find out what Nipsco will charge you to transport the gas from the city gate to your burner tip.  If my memory serves me, I believe you indicated that you were buying your gas directly from Nipsco, and if that is the case, then we will be comparing ""apples to apples"".

   Word of the Day for Tuesday March 26, 2002:

   ratiocination \rash-ee-ah-suh-NAY-shun; rash-ee-oh-\, noun:
   The process of reasoning.

     For  all  their  vaunted  powers  of  ratiocination,  grand
     masters of chess tend to be a skittery lot.
     --""People,"" [1]Time, October 26, 1987

     The adventures of Sherlock Holmes proved so popular that it
     became  a  given that mystery tales should include a sleuth
     who  investigates a murder or other crime, and by virtue of
     intelligence,  ratiocination and perseverance solves a case
     that initially seemed unsolvable.
     --Maxim  Jakubowski, ""A beginner's guide to crime fiction,""
     [2]The Guardian, October 29, 1999

     There   is   no  question  that  Joyce  and  Nabokov. . .
     brilliantly  explored  and  expanded the limits of language
     and the structure of novels, yet both were led irresistibly
     and  obsessively  to  cap their careers with those cold and
     lifeless  masterpieces, ""Finnegans Wake"" and ""Ada,"" more to
     be  deciphered  than  read  by  a handful of scholars whose
     pleasure is strictly ratiocination.
     --""How   I   Learned  To  Stop  Worrying  And  Love  'Barry
     Lyndon,' "" [3]New York Times, January 11, 1976
     _________________________________________________________

   Ratiocination  is  from Latin rationcinatio, from ratiocinari,
   ""to compute, to calculate, to reason,"" from ratio, ""reckoning,
   calculation, reason,"" from reri, ""to reckon, to think.""

Going Short for the Shortest Month

Day-ahead electricity prices in the Western U.S. were mostly higher
Wednesday on continued cold weather.  Some traders also said that rising
spot gas prices lent support to the daily power market.  ""The worst of this
cold snap appears to be over, but the market will likely take a day or so to
react,"" believed one marketer.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating
demand throughout the West was forecast to fall to below-normal levels over
the coming weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for
mostly normal temperatures from February 5 through 9.  February contracts
were trading a buck or two below the dailies at all of the major Western
hubs on Wednesday.  ""Historically, February has been a lighter load month
than January, and that's why we're heading into the new month with a short
position,"" said one matter-of-fact trader.  In other industry news,
Wednesday's AGA inventory report showed that U.S. gas stocks fell 111 bcf
last week, right in line with most industry estimates.  Total U.S.
inventories of 2.294 tcf were still 1.053 tcf, or 85 percent, above last
year.  Of the 111 bcf taken out of storage last week, 19 were drawn in the
Western Consuming region.  Total inventories in the West stood at 360 bcf,
or 71 percent of full.  Western stocks were at 222 bcf the same week a year
ago, and have averaged 265 bcf over the past five years.

Peak power prices in the Northwest rose marginally for Thursday delivery,
despite a general sense that the worst of the cold snap was over.  ""We were
a little surprised to see prices rise today because it is supposed to begin
warming up, and we are fairly bearish heading into February,"" said one
Washington-based trader.  Heating demand in the region was forecast to
steadily drop from 119 percent of normal on Thursday, to 99 percent of
normal on February 6.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward
again on Wednesday, coming in at 115 kcfs Thursday, 110 kcfs Friday, 80 kcfs
Saturday, 65 kcfs Sunday, 110 kcfs Monday and Tuesday, and 105 kcfs next
Wednesday.  In unit news, Bridger #4 (520 MW) was shut Wednesday morning due
to a plugged boiler.  While no ETR was given for the Wyoming-based unit,
sources familiar with thermal plants said such a problem is usually fixed in
48 hours or less.  While Colstrip #3 (700 MW) remained down with no official
ETR, some parties believed it would not return until February 9.

Amid continued below-normal forecasts for Thursday and stronger natural gas
values at the SoCal border, day-ahead electricity prices for delivery on the
last day of January gained ground in the Golden State.  Traders noted that
spot gas and light load prices were particularly strong.  ""I was surprised
that gas was strong today.  The forecasts are warming gradually though, so
gas should start to ease soon and electricity prices should fall off,"" said
one California trader.  Prices at COB settled higher on Wednesday, with
heavy load deals heard between 21.25 and 22.95$/MWh and light load changing
hands from 18 to 19.5.  ""We saw an opportunity to make some money at COB
today,"" said one Western dealer.  February COB lingered about 2$/MWh cheaper
than the dailies, with peak products heard trading near 20$/MWh and off-peak
pieces reportedly going through from 16.75 to 16.95$/MWh.  Similarly,
front-month deals at NP15 were heard about a dollar cheaper than the
dailies, near 22.75$/MWh for heavy load goods.  CAISO reported little change
in the overall generation landscape on Wednesday, with a difference of less
than 100 MW off-line to a day ago.  Of note, San Luis (326 MW) exited the
grid for planned maintenance.  Thursday temperatures were expected to reach
highs in the low-60s at southern load centers, and about 50 degrees at
mid-state.  The five-day forecast called for gradual warming, with
temperatures still expected to be about four degrees below normal on Sunday.
The most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from February 5 to
9.

While peak power prices in the Southwest dipped by 50 cents on both the high
and low ends, the bulk of deals were done at slightly higher levels than on
the previous day.  Continued cold weather and rising spot gas values were
the main factors lending support to the dailies on Wednesday.  Starting on
Friday, heating demand in the desert region was forecast to drop sharply,
dipping to below-normal levels by February 3.  Peak electricity prices at
Palo Verde ranged from 23$/MWh early, to a late-session high of 26$/MWh,
while February contracts were heard around the 21.65$/MWh mark.  Light load
goods for Thursday delivery traded from 14.75 to 17$/MWh, while February off
peak was seeing action near the 14.7$/MWh level.  There were no new outages
of consequence to report in the Southwest on Wednesday, but looking further
ahead, Palo Verde #2 (1,270 MW) was scheduled to shut for spring maintenance
from March 16 through April 20.  Weather forecasts called for gradual
warming over the coming weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting normal temperatures from February 5 through 9.

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an ""Emissions Strategy 
Meeting"" in mid-May to discuss global emissions issues -- such as climate 
change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and explore some of the 
potential business opportunities for Enron commercial groups.

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
for Enron in both the short and long term.  We invite you or a member of your 
group to participate in this important strategic discussion.

Our target dates are May 16, 17 or 18 in Houston (likely time is 10 a.m. - 12 
p.m.).  Please respond immediately with your best available dates so we can 
finalize our arrangements.

Please review the attached invitation and preliminary agenda.  If you have 
any questions or suggestions in advance of the meeting, do not hesitate to 
contact me of Jeff Keeler.

We look forward to your participation.

2739,"Last year money was to be set aside in reserves to cover the net amount needed
to resolve these issues with Transco, BUG , LILCO and Enron.  The total 
dollars
required was approximately $4.25 million.  An amount of $3.55 million needed 
for 
the Transco historical imbalance resolution.  The remaining balance was needed
for the BUG and LILCO accounting issues that Keyspan brought to our attention 
last year.

Bob Hall has $3.5 million reserved in his area for the Transco historical 
imbalance.
The remaining $50,000 for Transco and approximately $700,000 of additional 
funds
for the accounting issues were to be reserved last year under ""The Office of 
the
Chairman"".  Sally Beck and Janet Dietrich arranged for this additional money 
to
be reserved at the ""Chairman"" level since the additional funds were needed to 
correct an old accounting problem that should not hit the East Desk P&L.  
Also, the 
arrangement was that the reserve would be maintained until the settlement 
payments
were made by Enron.

As with most stories, there is some good news and some bad news.  First, the 
bad news.
After a great deal of investigation, it appears that there currently is no 
reserve at the
""Office of the Chairman""  for these additional funds.  Now, the good news.  
Georgeanne 
will take the necessary steps to make sure there is money available so that 
we can
quickly resolve these issues with Keyspan and Transco.

If you have questions, please give me a call.

will see alot needed to be changed based upon the parties' discussions.  The

engineers come up with on these issues.

Please note that I have incorporated the insurance provisions that were just 
e-mailed to me, but they require some cleaning up.

Please also note that contrary to what we were saying yesterday, the 
respective owner's would not be able to execute the O&M agreements on Monday 
because Enron would not control those entities then.  Only when the closing 
occurs and Enron takes control of the 2 owners would they have the authority 
to sign on behalf of those entities.

are you going and where are you going. Sounds like a good trip give us the
details before you leave huh!!!!
           We just got back from our Big Bend trip Tuesday evening. We
really enjoyed it the mountains are awesome, you have to see it to get full
effect of it. We saw Bracketville where they made the film Alamo and
Lonesome Dove. That was really neat. Then we drove to Alpine and Fort Davis.
We spent the night in the Davis Mountains Indian Lodge. We also saw Fort
Collins,that night and the next day we drove to the McDonalds Observatory in
the Davis Mountains. We got to look through all the big telescopes at the
moon, venus, and saturn. The next day we went back to look at the sun and
they took us to the Hobby Eberle telescope and told us all about it. Then we
drove to Big Bend Park and stayed at the Lodge at the base of the Chiso
Mountains. There is so many variations of rocks, mountains and deserts in
that area. It was really something to see.
   James came over the other day and I was keeping Jacob, so I let them draw

when we meet on Thursday.  Currently,  Tom Byargeon, Lisa Druzbik and I 
intend to come to El Dorado on Thursday.  I believe that we could get to 
Murphy's office by 11:00 or 11:30.  We would enjoy taking you to lunch before 
or after our meeting.  Please let me know the best time to meet with you, so 
that we can plan our trip accordingly.  I will send an agenda to you by

2827,"On Friday, January 26, 2001, an earthquake rocked the western region of 
India. The earthquake reportedly had a magnitude of  7.9 and was centered in 
the state of Gujarat. Initial reports indicate the death toll to be at least 
15,000. Most of the damage was reported in Ahmedabad, the state's commercial 
center.

Enron has a significant business presence in India. It has E&P interests off 
the Gujarat coast and is the majority owner of the Dabhol Power project, 
ultimately a 2,184 MW (net) generating plant, serving consumers in the state 
of Maharashtra, which borders Gujarat to the south. Consequently, Enron Oil 
and Gas India Limited (EOGIL), Enron India and DPC have mobilized staff and 
resources in India to tangibly assist the relief effort (e.g. contributing 
emergency medical supplies).    

Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take 
advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your 
donation.  Enron will match, dollar for dollar, every donation that you make, 
up to $15,000 annually per employee.  Listed below are a multitude of 
organizations that are offering aid to the victims of this earthquake.  To 
print a Matching Gift form, please click here << File: 
http://home.enron.com/cr/ >>  and then click on gifts, grants and giving.  
Please fill out the form and send it with your check to 3AC-1409.  We will 
send the money collected, along with a check from Enron for the same amount, 
to each of the organizations.  Please make sure to write ""India"" in the memo 
area on your check.  

If you have any questions, please contact Misha Siegel via email.

London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk 
and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.

2848,"Three problems with this Draft.

1.  In Paragraph 1.1, they removed my requirement of installing a system to 
meet ""all of Enron's electrical power requirements for the Driver"".  My 
concern here is that they put in equipment that is not adequate to handle our 
load requirements.  At a minimum we should state a specific load requirement 
for this station.  E.g. 10,000 HP.

2.  In Paragraph 1.1, they inserted a requirement that Plain's approve any 
in-service date for the driver and that the Telecommunication Equipment would 
be in-service by such date.  My draft had a date established by Enron solely 
and Plains would have to meet such date.  I think we need control of our 
in-service date without Plains prior approval.  We will be reasonable in 
establishing such date.

3.  Plains disclaims all warranties with respect to the Telecommunication 
Equipment.  This was not in the first draft.  We need some assurance that 
this equipment will do the job we need it to.

I would be happy to discuss these directly with Plains' attorneys at their 
convenience.

of an existing interconnect off the Trawick System into TUFCO.  The 
interconnect is solely a delivery to TUFCO.  We are down to one point of 
difference in the agreement.  

Typically HPL disclaims any liability for consequential damages to the other 
party.  TUFCO is asking for an exception for any violation of gas quality 
specifications.  This would mean that if HPL delivered off spec gas to TUFCO 
which required cleanup of their pipeline system or caused damage to a 
customer of TUFCO's HPL would be liable under this Agreement.  

From a legal standpoint, we can make this exception, but I wanted to make 
sure everyone understood and agreed with the acceptance of this potential 
liability.  Assuming we are properly monitoring all our receipts there 
shouldn't be an issue. 

Please let me know what you think about this situation.  I can forward a copy

2876,"Dear PIRA Retainer Client:

European electricity markets are experiencing an unprecedented surge in trading volumes and will be entering new phases of integration and liberalization in the years to come. As barriers to trade rapidly erode among countries, and regional markets emerge, we are witnessing all forms of change in pricing basis, and new areas of power trade are constantly evolving.

With these changes in mind, PIRA Energy Group announces the launching of its new European Electricity Service (EES) <http://www.pira.com/ClientServices/EES.htm>, an Internet-based Retainer Service that complements PIRA's existing market coverage of European and North American natural gas, North American power, and global oil.

EES provides clients with a robust data base, including detailed information for over 4,000 power plants, as well as market insights into the developments of power generation, demand, cross-border trading, and prices. PIRA's reputation for grasping market fundamentals is unrivaled, and EES continues in that tradition by helping clients to analyze how to capture value in the rapidly changing European electricity market.

Clients of EES will benefit from:

1. Analysis of major and subtle shifts in market trends, which will impact supply availability, power demand, cross-border trading, and price direction;

2. Opportunities to dig deeply into the rich EES database and reveal key issues influencing both short- and long-term market fundamentals;

3. Integration of PIRA's unparalleled reputation for gas and oil forecasting in addressing interfuel competition and arbitrage opportunities in the European market.

The attached prospectus provides more information about EES or you can go to our website at http://www.pira.com/ClientServices/EES.htm. Please take some time to review the material and contact me to discuss the service or to sign up for an online trial of EES.

PLEASE NOTE: Current PIRA European Natural Gas (ENG) Clients can realize significant discounts when adding EES to their existing ENG Retainer Service.

     substantial executive, has a somewhat different attitude to
     the  worth  of  the  professions  than  her  wastrel, ludic
     husband.
     --Pat Kane, ""Pleasing papa,"" [1]The Guardian, July 11, 2001

     He  is  indeed the outstanding imaginative prose stylist of
     his  generation,  with  an  entirely  recognizable literary
     manner,  fizzy  and playful (I am trying to avoid the words
     ""pyrotechnic"" and ""ludic"").
     --Geoffrey  Wheatcroft,  ""What  Kingsley Can Teach Martin,""
     [2]The Atlantic, September 2000

     But  within  this  ludic tale there lurks a tragedy of love
     and  loss  that  does  not  lose  its  tenderness even when
     embedded  in  [the  author's] perpetually farcical frame of
     mind.
     --Richard   Bernstein,   ""Lalita,   Post-Modern  Object  of
     Desire,"" [3]New York Times, September 8, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Ludic derives from Latin ludus, ""play."" Ludicrous, ""amusing or
   laughable,"" shares the same root.

If I want to communicate with the other commission members, am I supposed to 
funnel it through you?  If so, I want to find out if anyone is interested in 
setting up a table at the carnival (April 21) to solicit public opinion on 
P&Z issues.  We could set up next to the tree committtee or share a table.  
I'll be at the carnival until about 3 pm; however, I'll be working from 
12-2.  Also, we could solicit public opinion outside the clubhouse on 
election day, May 5.  I could do that anytime before 4 pm.  Anyone else 
interested???

Thanks,

GUARANTY AGREEMENT
SAMPLE  FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY
 This Guaranty Agreement (this ""Guaranty""), dated as of ________, is made and 
entered into between ________________, a ___________ corporation (""Guarantor
""), and ______________________, a _____________ ___________ (""Contract 
Party"").

 WHEREAS, (i) Contract Party and ____________________, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Guarantor (""Obligor""), are contemplating entering into an 
ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date here-with and herein 
incorporated for all purposes (said Agreement, as the same may be from time 
to time extended, amended and supplemented, particularly including, without 
limitation, all Transactions thereunder, the ""Gas Contract""), (ii) Guarantor 
will directly or indirectly benefit from the Gas Contract and (iii) as a 
condition precedent to the consummation of the Gas Contract, Contract Party 
has required that Guarantor unconditionally guarantee to Contract Party all 
payment obligations of Obligor under the Gas Contract.

 NOW THEREFORE, to induce Contract Party to enter into the Gas Contract, 
Guarantor agrees as follows: 
 
1.  PAYMENT GUARANTY.  Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally 
guarantees to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor set forth in 
the Gas Contract and interest thereon accrued as provided in the Gas Contract 
(the ""Obligations""); provided, the applicable rate of interest shall never 
exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by law.  This guaranty of payment is 
a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until 
complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and 
payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty 
shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas 
Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive 
the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas 
Contract (the ""Indemnity Period"").  With respect to any Claims threatened or 
filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from 
any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.  No notice of the Obligations 
or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and 
Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations 
or any Transaction.  Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to 
its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, 
(ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (iii) action be brought 
against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should 
Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.  Specifically, 
without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or 
procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or 
any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person 
or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (iii) an action 
separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other 
person or entity.  The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of 
Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any 
other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning 
which Guarantor is the principal obligor.  To the extent Obligor shall fail 
to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its 
obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other 
person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against 
Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.  The obligations of 
Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and 
Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to 
time of any of the following:  (i) extensions (whether or not material) of 
the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the 
modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas 
Contract or the Obligations, (iii) except for applicable statutes of 
limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract 
Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any 
right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other 
person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of 
Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or 
extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, 
(v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, 
without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or 
reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights 
or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release 
or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance 
by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas 
Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of 
the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other 
obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed 
or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (viii) the 
failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or 
security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or 
the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, 
or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other 
indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to direct, 
actual damages and, unless expressly provided in the Gas Contract, Guarantor 
shall not be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or 
indirect damages, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, in 
tort, contract or otherwise, or any penalties or charges assessed by any 
person or entity for the unauthorized receipt of gas.  Upon 30 Days written 
notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent 
shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a 
guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better 
creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit 
rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information 
concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both 
current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party 
in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a 
form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party, 
taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply 
to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all 
such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of 
credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and 
delivery.
2.  MAXIMUM LIMIT.  The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations 
in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that 
ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed 
$_____________ (the ""Maximum Limit""); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and 
Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable 
expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and 
similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or 
other enforcement against Guarantor.  The Maximum Limit shall not be affected 
by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or 
application of any collateral by Contract Party.
3.  DEFENSES.  Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor 
retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.  Guarantor WAIVES all rights, 
setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the 
Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs, 
counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, 
dissolution or liquidation of Obligor.      
4.  DEFAULT.  If Obligor fails or refuses to pay timely any Obligations, 
Contract Party may at its option exercise any or all of its rights, powers 
and remedies afforded hereunder and under all documents, if any, securing 
this Guaranty and may declare the unpaid amounts of all Obligations then 
owing under the Gas Contract to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon 
such amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentation and 
demand for payment, protest, notice of protest or dishonor, notice of 
default, notice of intent to accelerate or notice of acceleration to 
Guarantor or any other person or entity, all of which Guarantor hereby 
WAIVES.  
5.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that:  
(i) it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of 
the State of its incorporation and has the power and authority to execute, 
deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of this Guaranty, (ii) no 
authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, 
any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is 
required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this 
Guaranty and (iii) assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof 
by Contract Party, this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding 
agree-ment of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as 
the enforceability thereof may be limited by the effect of any applicable 
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting 
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.
6.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  At the written request of Contract Party, 
Guarantor shall provide Contract Party with the financial information 
described in Appendix ""1"" of the Gas Contract under Financial Information in 
accordance therewith.
7.  NOTICE.  All notices and communications made pursuant to this Guaranty

Contract are acknowledged and agreed to by Guarantor and Guarantor agrees not

Contract.  This Guaranty shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of

Contract Party.  This Guaranty embodies the entire agreement and 
under-standing between Guarantor and Contract Party and supersedes all prior 
agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.  The 
headings in this Guaranty are for purposes of reference only, and shall not 
affect the meaning hereof.  This Guaranty may be executed in any number of

As I mentioned in a voice mail a couple of weeks ago, Reliant has expressed some concerns about the current EnronOnline notification process for changes to power products.  My initial response after discussions with EnronOnline was to explain to Reliant that EnronOnline cannot change the notification process from them and to suggest alternative internal measures that Reliant can implement to monitor product changes.  (According to EnronOnline, no other objections to the notification process have been received by EOL.)   I had heard nothing else for a couple of weeks, and to date Reliant's use of EOL apparently has not been affected.  However, one of Reliant's attorneys, Dede Russo, called me yesterday to discuss the issue again.  I spoke with Rogers Herndon yesterday about Reliant's concerns, and Rogers perceives a real risk that Reliant will discontinue its use of EOL if we do not respond to their concerns.

I would like to discuss this issue with you briefly and suggest that we may want to meet with Savita Puthgai of EnronOnline to consider how best to respond to Reliant.

Enron's Departure from Core Business
Takes a Toll on Performance =20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) stock sustained further he=
avy losses on October 19 as investor confidence in the former Wall Street f=
avorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in=
 over four years. The energy giant's stock was off $3.32 or 11.45 percent a=
t $25.68 per share at mid-day trade on Oct. 19, making a cumulative loss of=
 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third-quarter loss of $638 mi=
llion. As of early morning trading on Oct. 22, Enron shares were priced at =
$21.99, a reflection of new developments (including a new Securities and Ex=
change inquiry) that have caused uncertainty about the company among invest=
ors.=20
Analysis: Enron's first financial report since the departure of former CEO =
Jeffrey Skilling in August has not done much to once again instill investor=
 confidence in the company, which has experienced one of its most turbulent=
 years in recent memory. While Skilling cited personal reasons for his depa=
rture, many analysts suspected that a significant drop in Enron's share pri=
ce and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role. A=
t the time of Skilling's departure, Enron's stock had tumbled to a 52-week =
low. However, based on the new 3Q report, it now appears that Enron's downw=
ard turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company=
's top spot. In essence, Enron's financial problems have been caused by bus=
inesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its cor=
e focus on wholesale power sales. It appears that Enron is learning a costl=
y lesson-namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company'=
s innovation, especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromis=
ed. The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron, as a good number of unre=
solved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry in=
to financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow=
 the company.=20
Let's first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the t=
hird quarter. As noted, as a whole the company reported $638 million in los=
ses, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its n=
on-core businesses. When we break down the losses, it becomes clear that En=
ron is struggling with its operations in three businesses: water, broadband=
 and the retail power market. Specifically, Enron reported $287 million in =
charges from Azurix, its water and wastewater business; $180 million in cha=
rges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations (including sever=
ance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts); and $544 =
million in what the company is calling ""investment losses."" Evidently, abou=
t half of the $544-million figure is related to Enron's investment in NewPo=
wer Company, the retail electricity and natural-gas provider that Enron lau=
nched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM. Enron owns =
45 percent of NewPower. In addition, Enron's debt to total capitalization r=
atio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent, although Lay says that p=
ending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002.=
 However, it is important to note that Enron's 3Q recurring net income (bef=
ore the write-offs) did increase 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a =
diluted share, and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 bi=
llion in 3Q 2000.=20
The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting. As one of=
 the leading investors in the company, Enron drove NewPower's aggressive bu=
siness focus on retail residential power sales, despite ongoing concerns ab=
out the development of retail competition across the United States. NewPowe=
r went public last year at an opening price of $21, and in the early days o=
f its initial public offering was trading above that price. However, the co=
mpany's stock has experienced a devastating drop in value, and is currently=
 priced at $1.25. NewPower is not scheduled to release its own 3Q financial=
 statement until early November, but it is expected that the company will c=
ontinue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Specificall=
y, NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3Q loss of $6=
5 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. Third-quarter revenue =
reportedly will be slightly lower than the $60 million to $65 million that =
the company had forecast in August. =20
In analyzing NewPower's 2Q financial losses (see IssueAlert from 8/8/01 at =
www.scientech.com/rci ), I argued that the company is really struggling fro=
m a mix of positive and negative factors in its efforts to become the leadi=
ng retail energy provider in residential and small business markets in the =
United States. On the positive side, NewPower has recently secured a large =
number of new customer accounts, most significantly from its purchase of cu=
stomers and related assets from AES Corp. and DTE Energy. These purchases p=
rompted an impressive growth spurt for NewPower, and the company reportedly=
 now has a customer base in 22 markets in 10 states. However, the bad news =
for NewPower is that its losses continue to widen, apparently resulting fro=
m a combination of weather factors and financial hits absorbed in several o=
f the states in which the company operates. This dichotomy does not appear =
to be getting any better, and the company's stock has continued to drop as =
a result.=20
In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes, NewPower recently rev=
ised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp. and several of i=
ts subsidiaries. The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cas=
h collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries th=
rough Jan. 4, 2002. With the lowered financial obligations that it must mak=
e to Enron, NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resour=
ces to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset=
-based financing.  =20
However, from Enron's perspective, the losses associated with NewPower (and=
, by the same token, the losses in water and broadband) have contributed to=
 a steady drop in its own stock price. The message is clear: The businesses=
 that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as =
a whole. Further, what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enron's p=
art has not translated into measurable profits, and consequently Wall Stree=
t has reacted by sending Enron's stock to a level that is about half of whe=
re it was a year ago. The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all=
 unique, but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from wh=
at was a successful core business. Further, they are similar in that Enron =
aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which i=
t arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth. The problem with Enron'=
s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of f=
iber-optic lines, which has prevented the demand for the division's service=
s from materializing as anticipated. The problem with Azurix, which has bee=
n losing money since its formation in 1998, is that privatization of the wa=
ter sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies ant=
icipated. In addition to these problem areas, Enron also faces challenges r=
elated to its investments in India (where it is locked into a legal battle =
with the state government) and California (from which Enron has yet to rece=
ive full payment for previous power sales). =20
In addition to the losses outlined in the 3Q report, there are new issues t=
hat are brewing at the start of this week. First, the SEC has requested tha=
t Enron provide information regarding ""certain related party transactions.""=
 Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry.=
 However, it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns relate=
d to the dealings of Enron's Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who up =
until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from E=
nron. Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SEC's reque=
st. In a separate development, several mutual funds (including AIM Constell=
ation that once held large positions in Enron) have either liquidated or re=
duced their holdings in the company, which has further weakened Enron's sto=
ck value. Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about =
Enron's ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an =
energy trader.=20
The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company r=
emains on solid ground despite the losses. Thus, Lay has been quick to reit=
erate that earnings from the company's energy and gas-pipeline business are=
 still strong. Further, Lay says that the charges reported in the third qua=
rter should be seen as a way to ""clear away issues that have clouded the pe=
rformance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses."" Neverthele=
ss, the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward i=
ts diversification effort, and in addition to water and broadband the compa=
ny has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well. Thus, se=
veral questions remain at this juncture. Are the losses reported in the thi=
rd quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for t=
he company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trad=
ing? Or, will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002? Moving =
forward, will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the=
 various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably? On=
ly time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at En=
ron, which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change.=20

Just a quick note to let you know that Mom and Dad arrived around 10am on

Phoenix and we went to lunch.  He was back on the road for Houston around
1:00pm.  There is a new subdivision going up down the street from us so we
walked down there yesterday afternoon and wandered through some of the

the construction, etc.

Structuring got back to us with some issues we need to clarify to get the 
pricing from a trader.

Capacity
 - Will Calpine be able to get manufacturer's guarantee for net capacity (or 
can we re-sell turbines to third party?)
 - Is it ""unit contingent call"" or there will be a kind of ""liquidated damage 
protection"" within the tolling agreement?

Nodal pricing
 - What is the exact name of substation in eastern PJM? Structuring could not 
find ""Parlin"" (even within eastern PJM, there will a substantial pricing 
differential among different bus points).

Gas delivery point

Actually, it is really hard to get the number by today since a trader who 
will give pricing is not here today and such a short period of notice. If we 
don't hear from you or/and if you don't decide yet, we will make assumption 
as follows;

- Capacity: 180 MW out of 4 LM-6000 turbine with manufacturer's guarantee and 
with term of liquidated damage protection included.
- Exact substation: East Hub in PJM
- Gas delivery point: Transco Zone 6

We will try to get the pricing hopefully by tomorrow. Please call me at

We got curves and spread option value from Structuring. Ben and I are 
finalising the first model based on following valuation method;

Valuation of Retail Short =
+ 1. Revenue from serving load (to get 12% IRR)
+  2. Expense from serving load at the market
+ 3. Spread option value for full capacity
+ 4. ICAP ($1.00/kw-mo for first 6 months)
- 5. Fixed expenses

Someone may think #2 (Expense from serving load at the market) is redundant, 
which maybe true, but I still think it is not double counting.

#1, 2, and 3 can be written as follows: (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + Max[(Pmkt - MC), 
0]*Capa, where Pees is Energy price charged to EES, Pmkt is Market price of 
power, Lees is EES load, MC is Marginal cost of peaker, and Capa is Capacity 
of peaker. Therefore,

If (Pmkt - MC) < 0, (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees,
If (Pmkt - MC) > 0, (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*Capa, 
   (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees),
   (Pees - Pmkt + Pmkt - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees),
   (Pees - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees).  

This correctly shows our structure, I think. I will try to talk to you today 
after we finish model. Thank you.

E2.  No; however, CFR60 subpart GG short term limits still apply

T1.  ""on any asset"" should read ""of any asset""

O5. Since commercial operations, the Wheatland facility has averaged xx 
starts per machine, and the Lincoln facility has averaged yy starts per 
machine.  The start-up and commissioning process followed a normal startup 
progression.  The Lincoln facility experienced a generator failure in unit #7 
during the first run season.  General Electric replaced the generator under 
warranty provisions.  Sratification of gas flows was observed in the stacks 
at the Wheatland facility during CEMS certification.  The CEMS certification

was being very creative but obviously not.  I was in Rio for new years and
it was a sick time.  I have some digital pictures I will send you next time
I download to a floppy disk.  The people in Rio were so cool and showing as
much skin as possible is the custom.  I am trying to finish up my

it.  I visited him before Christmas and he was partying like senior year of

""It is a condition of employment that each employee accept the responsibility of complying with the foregoing policies.  The Company will require each employee of the Company to complete and submit a statement in a form designated by the Company pertaining to such employee's compliance with the policies set forth in this booklet.  The Company reserves the right to request any employee to complete and submit such statement at any time or as frequently as the Company may deem advisable.""
(Enron Code of Ethics, July 2000, page 62)

What does that mean?

In layman's terms, everyone employed by Enron agrees to all the policies and standards listed in the current Code of Ethics (July 2000).

Who does it apply to?

The Code of Ethics applies to all employees, third party contractors, guests and licensees of Enron.  Additionally, employees are responsible for their family members and/or personal household who use, own, or have access to Enron's communication services and equipment -- including telephones, fax machines, computers, computer modems, long distance telephone services, cell phones, voice mail, pagers, e-mail, mail and delivery services.

What about my privacy?

Don't expect privacy when using Enron's equipment or services -- whether the activity is business or non-business related.  For example, don't use Enron's equipment to send or receive personal messages that you don't want monitored or accessed by the government, third parties or Enron.  In a nutshell, if you want privacy, don't use Enron's equipment.

Are there repercussions for non-compliance?

Yes.  An employee who violates any of the policies in the Code of Ethics is subject to disciplinary action, including suspension or termination of employment, and can include legal action if Enron believes it to be appropriate under the circumstances.


If you have any questions or comments about IT security or a related issue, please feel free to put them into eMeet (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf) under the ""IT Security"" category.  We'll monitor the site and respond to you there.",,,Company Enron eMeet

job description.

Thank you,
Lorie


=============================

Investment Banking Associate
The Denver office of Tucker Anthony Sutro Capital Markets
(""TASCM"") is currently recruiting a first or second year
Investment Banking Associate for a full-time position based
in Denver, Colorado.


Job Description

Investment Banking Associates assume immediate
responsibility by working on a broad array of transactions
with a variety of TASCM professionals.  Associates are
exposed to various functional areas of corporate finance as
well as to all Managing Directors in their office or
region.  TASCM Associates are integrally involved in the
preparation of client presentations and transaction
execution.  Successful Associates create, manage and teach
complex, interrelated financial concepts, financial models
and business models.
As they mature, Associates will continue receiving exposure
oriented towards rounding out their transactional and
industry experiences.  Associates generally will be
assigned to one or more industry verticals or product teams
on a priority, but not exclusive basis.  They should be
conversant in all areas of corporate finance, require
minimal guidance in executing assignments to which they
have had previous exposure, and be capable of assembling
flawless client/prospect presentations.  TASCM Associates
are assessed in terms of ability to understand new
concepts, to work effectively on several assignments
simultaneously and to execute high quantities of quality
work.
Associates typically enter the organization with a MBA or
other advanced degree.  Prospective applicants for an
Associate position should possess a strong desire to become
an investment banker and understand the challenges of the
job and its commitments.  Our Associates typically have a
strong background, either through undergraduate study or
career experience, in finance and accounting.  We prefer
individuals with prior investment banking or deal
experience.  All candidates should possess highly developed
communication and client management skills.
The most critical qualifications for a successful career as
an Associate at TASCM are the desire and ability to thrive
in an entrepreneurial environment.  Our client roster
includes many early stage companies working at the cutting
edge of technology and business innovation.  We seek
individuals who think like business owners and embrace the
challenges and opportunities of working on the frontier of
the new economy.
Finally, we look to hire Associates who possess the
intangible leadership skills, character, integrity and
vision required to lead TASCM into the new century.  We
assess every potential candidate both on ability to handle
the responsibilities of the Associate position and
potential to become a Managing Director.

same but have copied it below.  It describes a movement by certain CA 
legislators to attempt to enact a ""windfall profits tax"" on electricity 
sellers that essentially would be designed to claw back profits on 
electricity sales.  You will recall this was one of the items addressed in 
our ""pass through"" clause in the proposed CDWR contract.  I know that we, as 
Firm, looked into the various constitutional and other legal issues relating 
to such a tax a few months ago, so let me know if, in your spare time, you

3167,"We were very pleased to see the enthusiasm surrounding the opening of Enron 
Field yesterday as tickets to the first four games at the ballpark went on 
sale to employees.  Unfortunately, Enron was only able to obtain a very 
limited number of tickets from the Astros to these games, and as expected, 
tickets sold out very quickly.  Therefore, no tickets are available for sale 
going forward.

We appreciate the feedback, both positive and negative, that some of you have 
shared regarding the opportunity provided employees to purchase tickets and 
the process by which the tickets were sold.  We recognize that no method for 
selling such a limited supply of tickets would be without room for 
improvement.  The process was devised to  allow the majority of employees a 
fair and reasonable opportunity to secure tickets through Enron for one of 
these first four games.  While careful consideration was given to 
establishing a lottery system, direct sales were selected because of the 
magnitude of logistical issues surrounding a lottery of this scale and scope.
 
We established the 11am - 1pm time frame so that most employees could 
purchase tickets over their lunch hour, rather than during business hours.  
Much to our dismay, some employees began forming lines as early as 9:00am.  
By 10:00am, the crowd was so large that it presented a safety hazard within 
the building.  We began issuing flyers for tickets at 10:30am and selling 
tickets at 10:45am at my direction to eliminate any safety concerns.

Considering the demand for these tickets throughout the City of Houston and 
Southeast Texas, it is truly a benefit that Enron employees were provided a 
special opportunity  to purchase these tickets.  We regret that Enron does 
not have a larger number of tickets for these games to offer employees and 
that so many were disappointed.  We hope to be able to give away tickets to 
some of these games through special promotions, as well as provide 
opportunities to purchase tickets to other games throughout the inaugural 
season at Enron Field.
  
Tickets for all 84 home games are available through Ticketmaster outlets, 
including Houston-area Foley's, Fiesta and Kroger stores.  Those who wish to 
order by phone can call (713) 6-ASTROS.  Tickets are also accessible on-line 
at www.astros.com and www.ticketmaster.com.

3175,"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

We apologize for this inconvenience and are working with all of our partners to insure that this does not happen again.  As always, we remain committed to providing you power markets information around-the-clock. 

Product Update 

FriedWire has just added significant new content and capability to the Traffic Report, which are outlined below.  Please contact us for brief, online tutorials on how to use the new features. 

NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Weather Forecasts 

    3-7 day Maximum Temperatures 
    6-10 day Outlook and Temperature Probability 
    8-14 day Prognostic Temperature Anomaly 
    Excessive Heat Outlooks (for the same time periods listed above) 
    Precipitation Outlooks and Anomalies 

***You may also be able to set up e-mail notification services to alert you when the new forecasts become available so that you don't have to continually check to see if the new data have been posted. 

Available Transmission Capacity 
FriedWire has developed a new interface that will allow you to search for available transmission by path.  The new geographic interface will allow you to choose a path and then view the detailed ATC offerings and then navigate to easily see reverse-path information, thru-path offerings, offerings from non-path providers and more. 

***E-mail and wireless text-paging notification services are now available along with the new ATC interface.  Now, you can be automatically notified when new ATCs are posted by providers or on paths that you track ongoingly.  You can custom define your alerts according to the provider, path, service increment, time period, class, etc.that you're interested in, as well as define when you want to be contacted (days of the week, time of day, times per day, etc.). 

The following additional product upgrades have been deployed: 

All hourly offerings are now reflected in military time designations. 
Hourly ATC selection reflected now as a range (i.e.; 13:00 - 14:00) instead of hour-beginning 1:00 PM. 
Eight new flowgates have been added for Sierra-Pacific Power and 74 for MidAmerican Energy.  They all have Intertie Profiles and can be located by selecting ""View All Interties"".  All will be located and plotted on the power flow maps in the next couple of weeks. 
 You can now add one (or multiple) e-mail and text-page addresses easily in order to get Alerts from the Traffic Report.  Simply click on the link that says ""My Account"" at the top right-hand corner of any Traffic Report screen and look for the link just to the right of the E-mail * input field that says Enter additional e-mails.  Go to the Add an E-mail Contact link at the bottom of the next screen.

The Hourly group interacts with the Services and Middle Marketing groups to administer terms of Service Desk contracts, which may include the selling of excess generation and/or the purchasing of energy to meet customers' requirements.  Also, each trader is responsible for gathering and reporting information on unit outages, transmission line derations and other information pertaining to all West Desk Trading activity.

The West Hourly EOL Trader will be responsible for helping to lead the transition of hourly trading of energy in the California ISO and bilateral markets to Enron Online.  The trader is expected to initiate profitable trades while managing the company's risk exposure.  The trader is expected to understand all settlements procedures and be familiar with charges related to each type of trade.  The trader will proactively work to bring new hourly customers to Enron Online and will respond to internal and external billing inquiries.  This position is anticipated to last 3-6 months, with the trader moving to a shift rotation at that time.

Enron Global LNG
Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global wholesale LNG market.  The rising prices of natural gas in the United States and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for LNG in the U.S. and around the globe.   LNG has played a major role in serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world's growing appetite for cleaner burning fuels.   Enron Global LNG sees great opportunity for Enron's wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy market.


IN THE NEWS

Enron Corp. Says First-Quarter Profit Rose 20 Percent 
Houston, April 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, said first-quarter profit rose 20 percent as sales almost quadrupled. Profit from operations rose to $406 million, or 47 cents, from $338 million, or 40 cents, in the year-earlier period.  Enron raised its 2001 profit forecast to $1.75 to $1.80 a share, from its January projection of $1.70 to $1.75.

First-quarter revenue surged to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion as Enron boosted the volume of power sold in North America by 90 percent. Enron had a first-quarter gain of $19 million, or 2 cents a share, for an accounting change, making net income $425 million, or 49 cents a share. There were no charges or gains in the year-earlier period.

Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. (""EPMI""), Enron Energy Services Inc. (""EESI""), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation (""EEMC""), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation (""Portland General"")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the ""Enron Entities"")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter ""the Commission"").  We
make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000 with
the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating, offering
to produce or producing documents, these entities have not waived any
objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims,
defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have
been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary.
For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are protected from
disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges.


GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called ""family trees"" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called ""family trees"" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Data
will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce its public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, ESSI, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data for the purchase
and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   We anticipate
producing public filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and
the transaction data in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are very small and there will probably be limited documents
available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling
coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output, do
not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit
requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.
 For Portland General, there will be a very large volume of documents
and we propose to handle them differently.  First, Portland General will
provide for year 2000 electronic data in summary form similar to the data
being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant.  With respect
to specific generating cost data, because of the volume, we suggest that
these documents be made available in Portland for inspection from a
representative sampling of facilities.  If there are specific documents that
the Commission would like copied from that production, we can discuss the
arrangements for producing these documents.  We propose to make these
documents available in Portland in a third wave of document productions

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Request 13, 15, 16, 17, 19

 We understand that the CPUC will be obtaining trading data for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of trading data for
year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty, quantity,
delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is purchase or sale.   Because
of the speed with which you want this information, it is possible that some
entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those transactions where EPMI
served only as the scheduling coordinator, we understand that the ISO will
show part of the transaction, but there will not be a corresponding
transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.  The reason is that
this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's customer on an
accounting system rather than as part of the trading business.  EESI can
also provide similar electronic data with the proviso that it will not
include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide
a blind customer number.  Many of ESSI's customers have agreements whereby
they must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.
ESSI cannot meet your time frame to release information and give its
customers the notice they require.  We anticipate producing the transaction
data in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

3253,"Hi!   Thanks for the update, it is good to hear from you.  Sorry Grayson is 
being a crybaby.  It is tough being a baby, I think.  How did the doctor's 
app't go?  Bet you are ready for the weekend so Jim'll be around all day.  
Every working mom I know could not wait to get back to the office after 
maternity leave.  I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for 
everyone.  Baby gets a head start on her social life, and the parents can't 
wait to see the kid at the end of the work day!  Most everyone I know is 
raising their kids that way, and they seem to be turning out fine.  Even the 
handful of stay-at-home moms I've met leave their kids with someone several 
days a week, for sanity's sake.

Had lunch with Mema on Wednesday at Treebeards.  I get the impression that 
she's gotten the message that you and Jim don't exactly want her dropping in 
for spontaneous visits, so that's good.  I always enjoy meeting her for 
lunch--for some reason she's always on best behavior, and we always run into 
my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest.  Thank God she 
can never remember their names, or she might start calling them for lunch.  

Bill and I saw a play at Diverse Works last night called ""Fucking A.""  It was 
a take-off on The Scarlet Letter.  I thought it would be funnier but it was 
actually pretty dark.  The bearer of the letter A was an abortionist in a 
strange land working to pay her son's way out of jail.  Despite the subject 
matter it was one of the best plays I've seen in a very long time.  Diverse 
Works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown.  
(Nancy Littlejohn (Worthington) has her art gallery nearby.)  They mostly 
sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions.  A lot of it is 
really over the top, but I've seen some cool things there.  One of my friends 
at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so I've been 
hanging out there to see whether I like the people.  

Work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, I guess.

Time to read more FERC cases.  I don't wanna FERC, I just want to bang on the 
drum all day.

Hang in there, and please send more news of little bug!

With back-to-school season here, it is appropriate to address learning and
the learned. While the study of science, math and history and other worldly
pursuits is worthwhile, it is also important to remember that what really
matters can hardly be taught. I'll part with the words of Kabir, a medieval
Indian mystic poet, who never set foot in a classroom. Here is one of his
couplets, rendered in my less than poetic translation:

  The world passes while reading tomes, none any wiser;
  Truly learned is the one who learns the meaning of love.

So welcome back to school with the thought that the true purpose of education
is to realize that love counts most. And remember that school never stops at

   An ordinary, often ineffectual person who indulges in fantastic
   daydreams of personal triumphs.

[After the main character in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty by

   ""The men you see rolling over the zoysia at 5 miles per hour are

One of the most important ingredients of fiction is its characters. Think
of any memorable book, play or movie and you'll recall its people--from
protagonist (and deuteragonist and tritagonist and ...) to antagonist are
folks one can feel, relate to, though not necessarily always agree with.
These are the people with depths, they are not cardboard characters or
people who live a 2D life, to use the publishing jargon. These multifaceted
people come alive on the pages of a book, on the stage of a theater, or on
the screen of a movie theater with all their foibles, follies and victories.
Perhaps the ultimate sign of their character is that they live on on the
pages of dictionaries. This week's AWAD focuses on a few of these fictional
persons who came alive and added a bit more color to our language.     -Anu

3269,"I have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to 
TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks 
ago.  One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called 
(for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any 
percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper 
would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.  If a 
Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage 
would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest 
could be scheduled IT.  

Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this 
change with me.  As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT 
shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were 
in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.  Similarly, if TW were to 
notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity 
in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put 
their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.   TW's tariff 
language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a Limited Day is defined as 
a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and 
the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of 
gas is transported.  

Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the 
first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on 
the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).  If 
so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what 
you think.

factual inaccuracies we cannot live with (e.g., footnote 4).  If he wants to 
file his own exhibit he is certainly free to do so.  We don't plan to offer 
any comments to Norm regarding his exhibit at this time.  

With regard to the exhibit you sent us yesterday, while Transwestern feels 
there are many different ways to characterize delivery capacity to the

support SoCal's filing of the exhibit with the Commission as it is currently

motion to expedite the Commission's decision in this proceeding.  The motion 
would be filed pursuant to Rule 212 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and 
Procedure, which simply allows parties to file motions.  Sempra is not yet a 
party, so it would have to include in its pleading a motion to intervene out 
of time.  The Commission may grant late interventions pursuant to Rule 214 if 
the movant has good cause for failing to file the motion on time, permitting 
the intervention will cause no significant disruption of the proceeding, the 
movant's interest is not adequately represented by other parties in the 
proceeding, and no prejudice to other parties would result from granting late 
intervenor status.  Additionally, like other intervenors, Sempra must also 
explain its interest in the proceeding, including why it has a right to 
participate, why it could be directly affected by the outcome of the 
proceeding, and that its participation in the proceeding would be in the 
public interest.  (We've seen numerous interventions by Sempra and they have 
some standard language they use in their interventions to describe the 
company and request intervenor status).

I believe the answer is that SWGas will always be billed based on the 
one-part rate, regardless of how we choose to allocate the rate components.  
My understanding is that the reason we reserve the right to allocate the 
components is simply for internal accounting purposes, to keep any one 
component from exceeding the max or going below the min.

Sorry I haven't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated.  I 
am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don't think I'm going to go at 
exactly the same time as my parents.  As much fun as they are, I figured we 
would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them.

As for Ted, things are still going well although I haven't see him at all 
this week (we are two very busy people).  But, we had a great laid back day 
last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage...you know, not 
quite so formal about dates etc.  In one sense it's great, but it also makes 
things a lot harder to read.  Anyway, I'm sure my Mom told you guys but 
Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well.  Hopefully, if 
we're still dating come December, you and Chuck can meet him when you come 
back to visit.  I'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the U.T. 
games, I just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly 
prepare him for the Scott/Kelley/Parks/Wild Card gang and the full-day affair 
that is a U.T. game).

Things in Houston are good and definitely warm.  I went with Emily and her 
Mom last night to see the musical ""Rent"" and it was wonderful.  Also, I'm 
going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot's daughter 
Julie.  Needless to say I am very excited.

3293,"Hi Bonnie,

How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

Thanks a bunch,
Susan",Bonnie Lisa,,
3294,"so obviously i decided against coming up this weekend...ha.  on the one hand i thought it be nice to hang out today and have a little distraction before your apt., but then i thought it might be better for you to have the day to reflect, prep, etc.  anyways, just wanted to see how you're doing and since you do have the day off i figured you'd be popping into the cafe at some point.

got an email from Lisa...so she is at the school and sounded ok.  it was a short mass email.  hope to getter a longer one at a later date.  

talk to you soon,

3295,"well girls,

i didn't end up getting the job with Puget.  i was runner up to a guy with more trading experience.  he hadn't decided whether or not he was going to accept, which is why they were waiting to get back to me.  i called last night due to the decisions i was having to make around here and the VP i met with there subsequently called the guy to get an answer.  unfortunately for me, his answer was, ""yes"".  

anyway, while that opportunity is no longer...i have still decided to decline my offer with UBS to join the reformed trading organization down here.  on that front, i am still very interested in trying to get up to seattle and was wondering if either of you were familiar with some headhunters.  let me know if there are any things in particular you think i should be looking into.

thanks guys,

I just wanted to make sure you got the last email I sent you....in response to your email below.  If it's just taking some time to respond no worries, if you didn't receive it for some reason let me know ( I attempted to answer the various questions posed ).

Cheers,

3297,"Yes, I'm back from SD and appropriately depressed to return to hot, muggy Houston.  Glad to hear your trip was so enjoyable...and no worries about the pina colodas, you gotta do what you gotta do ( I was drinking rum punches in the Caymans like they were water...much scarier than pina colodas I assure you).  The weather, scenery and people in SD were gorgeous.  I really think I'm supposed to be in Del Mar.  There are the most attractive, active, worldly men swarming the beaches with even cuter dogs.  I spent a large part of the weekend with my tongue hanging out.  It forced me to the realization that the men in Houston, and much of Texas, are soft.  Alas, no exciting stories though...

Let me know how the movie is, I may have to make a special trip to see this one...All of the Kappas who've read the book insist I should write my own version filled with Susan's tails of woe.  There is definitely ample material.

Sorry to hear about Ben and the girlfriend.  I'm sure your parents will be sad to see his calming influence go.

Talk to you soon,

There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

""Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points"" - handled as being a transmission deal which will not be handled in this version.

Print button on error form - Printing the error sheet functionality

Things are coming back a bit, here is your sheet",,,
3307,"Dear Cara,  I can not speak for the other two but I want you to know that
I love you very, very much. The only way I could love you
more/differently is if you were my own offspring. It has been my
privilege to embrace you as part of our family. I was so happy to learn
that you were going to marry Dave and make it official. I love you very
much and will continue to love you for all time and eternity. You are a
special lady.

You have helped me in many ways. You came to my side when I had the
overwhelming job of caring for my Mother. Your wisdom and experience made
that part of life a lot easier. The help you gave Christine was
priceless.  Many times you have given me words of encouragement that gave
me that little bit I needed to go ahead and try what ever it was that I
was so unsure of. You comforted me when we lost Mom and Chip. You were
there for me when we nearly lost Cheri and when Dad took his turn hurting
me. Then there was the church crap that you listened to and helped me to
understand that I was not all the things they said I was and that we
could do better than to bury ourselves in 'that'. You cared for Nathan
for me so I could go and take care of Cheri. I was able to go without
having to choose between two people that I love. You are helping me in
other ways now that I will not discuss, but you know. Last but not at all
least is your humor. That has gotten me through untold hard times. You
will never know the half. I am not even sure I know all what a blessing
you have been to me.

I knew that when I started this list I would forget something and I am
sure I have. These are the things that pop into my mind when I think of
you. I love you very much and I Praise the Lord that He brought you into
our lives.

s momentum as investors showed they still prefer the future outlook for USD=
 over other major currencies. The dollar index is now at highs last seen in=
 August, at 116.89, which put the euro under pressure at a day's low of $0.=
8789.   EUR/USD peaked around 88.60 on Friday, but was unable to hold onto =
gains above 88.40, which led the pair back towards the 88-cent level on Mon=
day. Last week, the euro flirted with 88 cents, but maintained above key re=
sistance around 87.45. The Bundesbank November monthly report indicated as =
expected that Q3 growth was flat for the Eurozone's number one economy. Fla=
t growth in Q2 also contributed to a year on year growth rate of around 0.2=
5%, down from 0.6% in Q2, thus showing that Germany is very close to a tech=
nical recession. EUR/USD edged back below 88 cents, but did not trigger sto=
p loss orders and held to a day's low of 87.89.  Traders anticipate Wednesd=
ay's release of Germany's Ifo business climate index (an estimate of German=
 growth, which accounts for about one-third of the Eurozone) to recover sli=
ghtly in November to 86 after plunging to 85 in October from 89.5. Markets =
also await Eurozone industrial production figures for September, which like=
ly dropped since French and Italian outputs declined. Disappointing results=
 will most likely spark renewed selling in the euro. Support is seen at the=
 88-cent figure, backed by 87.70 and 87.45. Resistance is seen at 89.0, 89.=
30 and 89.50.  USD/JPY rose to a new 3-1/2 week high of 123.49, following a=
nother grim assessment of the Japanese economy by the Bank of Japan in its =
November report. ""Adjustments in economic activity are becoming severe, as =
the substantial decline in production is beginning to have an adverse effec=
t on private consumption through decreases in employment and income,"" the B=
oJ said in the monthly report. This was the sixth straight month the Bank c=
ited weakening private consumption and falling corporate profits at banks a=
nd the deterioration in the manufacturing sector will add weakness to domes=
tic demand, it said.   Following another downgrade in Japan's economic outl=
ook, it now appears that FY02 tax revenue will probably be revised down by =
Y2.8 trln from Y49.6 trln, according to the MoF. Therefore, sticking to PM =
Koizumi's important reform to limit JGB issuance to 30 trillion yen in FY02=
 will be difficult. In order to achieve this, further expenditure cuts will=
 be needed, which will likely find strong opposition within Koizumi's own L=
DP party. Japanese FinMin Shiokawa maintained that the government would lim=
it new issuance to Y30 trln, but more LDP lawmakers are now openly requesti=
ng further fiscal stimulus. Aggravating the situation is that tax projectio=
n for FY02 is most likely to be revised down further.  Adding pressure to t=
he yen is the fact that the BoJ decided by majority vote to keep monetary p=
olicy unchanged last week. It had eased in August and again in September bu=
t has since been keeping a wait-and-see stance. Interest rates are still ne=
ar zero and its liquidity supply in the money market exceeds its stated tar=
get of 6 trillion yen. Moreover, another possible move by the BoJ would be =
to purchase more foreign bonds, which would lead to a substantial fall in t=
he yen.   Rumor of selling interest in USD/JPY by exporters around 123.20 c=
apping gains. Technical resistance around 123.35 also limiting upside poten=
tial. Meanwhile, with little room for improvement in the Japanese economy u=
ntil late next year, most market watchers see the yen heading for 125 now t=
hat it has successfully breached the 123 mark. Resistance is seen around 12=
3.35/45. But USD/JPY support is expected to hold at 121.95/122.00 followed =
by 121.40/50, with any pullback towards the latter level seen as a buying o=
pportunity, dealers said.  EUR/GBP rose to a fresh high of 62.05 but is exp=
ected to stay rangebound at around 61-62 pence after recovering from recent=
 10-week lows around 60 pence. When that cross is steady, GBP/USD shadows t=
he movements in the more dominant EUR/USD. So far, cable has fallen to a ne=
w one-month low of 1.4210 as it continues to suffer further declines since =
last Wednesday's inflation report by the Bank of England signaled a shift i=
n market sentiment. The market is now more aware of the weaknesses the UK f=
aces due to the internal and external imbalances in the economy. BoE's King=
 pointed out that those imbalances might lead to a weaker pound. Moreover, =
the Bank appears more concerned about future inflationary pressures given t=
hat interest rates are now at a 40-year low. Therefore, interest rates are =
likely to be left on hold just as the labor market is showing its first sig=
ns of weakness, which will weigh on the pound. Major support now stands at =
1.4195 after GBP fell below key levels of 1.4250 and 1.4230.  Meanwhile, US=
D/CHF rose to a session high around 1.6673 after falling to a low of 1.6536=
 on Friday. Helping the dollar were comments from Swiss National Bank Chair=
man Jean-Pierre Roth who said the outlook for the U.S. economy is uncertain=
 but could improve if the war in Afghanistan ended. ""The uncertainty is cur=
rently unusually great. But there is a certain chance now that the developm=
ents could come out better than feared. If and when it is true that the war=
 in Afghanistan is over, that could give some important psychological impet=
us,"" he said. ""Switzerland is so dependent on world trade that of course we=
 cannot escape from developments abroad,"" he said. Moreover, the SNB aimed =
to conduct monetary policy ""so that our interest rates are as low as possib=
le in order to provide relief for the economy, but so that at the same time=
, we do not endanger price stability,"" he added. Inflation in Switzerland i=
s below one percent.  On Friday, Roth said in an interview with the Financi=
al Times that the Swiss franc's role as a safe-haven currency is declining =
because of the emergence of the euro. Thus Roth felt more at ease that the =
Swiss franc is reverting to the status of a normal currency as it becomes ""=
less important as a financial asset"". The Swiss National Bank has been dism=
ayed by the appreciation in the Swiss franc as investors sought shelter ami=
dst recent political uncertainty, thereby prompting the central bank to cut=
 rates. Roth asserted that ""if we were to face large capital inflows we wou=
ld have to respond through monetary policy and interest rates"" because ""it =
is an illusion to think that we have other instruments that we could use to=
 curb inflows"". Upside capped at 1.6680 and 1.670. Support holds at 1.6535,=
 1.650 and 1.6480.  Today's US data is expected to show a decline in housin=
g starts as the slowdown in the general economy starts to outweigh the bene=
fits of record low mortgage rates. However, USD strength continues to stem =
from the belief that the US-backed war in Afghanistan is going better than =
anticipated and this is translating into a fall in uncertainty and a rise i=
n confidence. Accordingly, dealers anticipate further gains on Wall Street =
this week, which is adding to the dollar's buoyancy.   =09[IMAGE] Audio Mkt=

Just a few additional thoughts on this list as possible topics:

1.  credit event upon merger - seems like more counterparties want to define 
the ""materially weaker"" standard.  Alos, I'm wondering how credit monitors 
mergers in general.

2.  additional termination events - when does credit consider additional 
events like change of control, MAC, chnages to partnership agreement or 
structure etc.

3.  minimum transfer amount - how it works and how it is different from the 
threshold

4.  threshold amount - what triggers makes it reduce to zero

5.  enforcement of collateral remedies - going over the timetable for 
enforcing our remedies when a counterparty fails to post and the different 
cure periods.

6.  letter of credit bank qualifications - confirming with credit that these 
are still current

7.  cash collateral in Canada

Judge Wagner issued a public Proposed Recommendation (the media was in the 
room) to resolve the matters before the Settlement process late Monday 
afternoon.

He initially talked about ""can bring a horse to water, but can't make him 
drink.""  

He went on to detail that the Suppliers had offered $716.1MM for Settlement 
($510MM for Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, Williams, Reliant + $125MM for Powerex + 
$49.6MM for 15 marketers + $6.5MM for 6 CMUA members + $25MM for outside 
Calif Utilities [includes PGE]).  He said thought refunds in the hundred of 
$millions or maybe $1billion were right.

His will propose the following method to the Commission.  

1. Retroactively apply the June 19 Order from Oct 2 - June 19.
2. Modify that decision to (a) use actual heat rates from marginal unit in 
NP15 and SP15, (b) use two daily gas prices - north CA and south CA, (c) 
incorporate NOx costs, (c) add a 10% credit premium.
3. Commission should hold an expedited 60 day hearing on matters relating to 
questions of material facts (Mwh sold, gas prices, etc).

He did indicate that his perspective was that the moneys owed could be offset 
against CAISO bills.

Importantly, we are unsure if the Judge will recommend to have FERC  (a) 
determine that upon the application of this refund Order the rates are 
determined to be J&R, (b) ensure that all buyers in these markets get similar 
refunds, (c) limit the refund to not include CDWR and CAISO Out-of-Market 
transactions.

We are intending to communicate with the Judge's staff tomorrow on these 
issues to seek clarity.

Finally, is it appropriate to have Charles River Associates attempt to 
calculate the refund liability?  We may want to understand the risk under 
different assumptions.

Thanks,

3419,"Late this morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the 
committee print, as amended, of an energy package that addresses 
conservation, clean coal, renewables, hydro, nuclear, and boutique fuels.  
The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill.  Other committees -- Ways and Means, 
Science, and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week.  Thus, the 
House is on track to consider a merged package before the start of the August 
Recess on August 3rd.

As to electricity, during the several days of debate this week both Chairmen 
Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity 
issues.  Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he 
chairs will hold a hearing on Friday, July 20th on all electricity issues 
other than transmission.  While Mr.  Barton has publicly held out hope of 
marking up an electricity bill this month, sources on and off the committee 
do not see this timetable as realistic.  On the Senate side, the majority 
staff is working on an electricity ""white paper"" that may be circulated for 
comment next week.

Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron:

1. Last night, on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall, Green and 
John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by Rep. 
Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA)) 
that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and essentially 
ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers.

2. First thing this morning the Committee, again on a largely partisan basis 
(with Democrats Hall, Green, John and Towns), rejected a Waxman amendment to 
impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other than generation 
added after 1/1/01).  (Originally, Mr. Waxman was going to offer amendment to 
impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not supply all available 
power during an emergency, but he ended up offering basically what he had 
pursued in subcommittee on the old ""Californa Only"" bill.)

3. The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the Natural 
Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas ""transportation facility"" shall 
not be added to the National Register of Historic Places until FERC has 
abandoned the facility.  Apparently there have been some instances of ""old"" 
pipelines being considered as ""historic places"" under federal law.  The House 
Resources Committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterday.

4. By voice vote, the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require the 
president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse gases down 
to 1990 levels.  There was strong opposition voiced by many Republicans and 
Democrats to this amendment.

5. By mixed vote of 24 to 29, the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment to 
set cost and performance goals for renewables, including wind power, and 
authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50 
percent).",Tauzin Barton John Jane Harman Anna Eshoo Waxman Shadegg,,"the House Energy and Commerce Committee Ways and Means Resources the

stronger, and 2) We need to coordinate closely on all documents used in these

the Fall of 2001(as set out in his speech) and to share with the Premier some 
proposals for moving the matter forward. I also indicated that Mr. Lay would 
be able to provide the Premier with a useful  and honest perspective on the

3425,"On point #1 - I think that at the end of the day, FERC will not deal with the Negative CTC directly.  All they will do is reset prices.  The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC.  We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the ""high"" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.  The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.  It simply took dysfunction and ran.  We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.  Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money.  Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to ""re-bill"" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs.

On point #2 - See point above.  I doubt, however, that all ""high"" prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling.

3428,"Rules governing suspension of DA and threats of retroactive suspension
We have helped assemble a coalition of ESPs and business customers to get the most liberal rules possible (e.g., customers can renew DA contracts, customers can add facilities if contract permits, ESPs can assign contracts to other ESPs with consent of customer, ESP and customer can modify existing contract provisions.)
The ESP coalition that we're a part of will file comments on Wednesday on how the suspension rules ought to work.
Retroactively suspending DA remains on the table for debate and remains a threat. But support at the Commission for retroactivity has diminshed considerably and most think that the likelihood of retroactivity is low at this point.  
One Commissioner--Carl Wood--continues to express support for pushing the date back, however.

Ruling Issued by California Commissioner requiring market participants to submit their DA contracts to the Commission by first week of December for review.
Commissioner Wood is openly and ideologically opposed to consumer choice and competition and continues his attempts to roll back choice.
Wood issued a ruling ""requiring"" ESPs and customers to submit their contracts to the PUC for review to determine among other things whether the DA suspension date should be retroactively pushed back to some date prior to Sept 20.
We are working with the same group of business customers and ESPs to oppose Wood's order.
Today, the group agreed to the following:
1) Overall, customers and ESPs will not submit contracts to the California Commission (though there may be a small group that breaks ranks).
2) The group will jointly ask the full Commission to overturn Wood's ruling requiring submission of contracts on the grounds that the ruling is illegal. The group will likely file the joint appeal by the end of this week or first thing next week.
3) In addition, folks will submit separate comments on or around Dec. 3rd to the Commission regarding:
a) the legal reasons to support the argument that the commission doesn't have the legal authority to ask parties to turn over contracts, and,
b) the policy reasons to support the argument that the Commission doesn't need specific contracts, or contract language, to implement the suspension of DA effectively.  

Edison's Proposal to Implement the Settlement It Reached with the PUC in Order to Avoid Bankruptcy.
A local consumer group (""TURN"") protested Edison's filing. 
TURN told the Commission that the proposal requires signficantly more time, scrutiny and analysis than Edison would allow under its proposed schedule.
We're likely to support TURN's suggestion that considerably more time and scrutiny are required since Edison's proposal could have a significant effect on EES' book in California.

Will distribute additional information as it happens. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us.

8 State Power Contracts Seen as Bad Deals
Energy: The long-term pacts require the purchase of too much electricity at too high a price for too long, a study finds. Immediate renegotiation is urged.
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL
Times Staff Writers

September 30 2001

SACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated, according to a new, detailed study. 

The biggest problems are so-called ""take or pay"" clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it, the study said. 

The contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price, according to the analysis, which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer, environmental and renewable energy groups. 

Between January and September, the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities, which have been unable to buy power on their own. The longest of the contracts would last 20 years, and overall, the pacts are estimated to cost $43 billion over the next two decades. 

Power generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts, but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state. 

""If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts, we will consider it,"" said Joe Ronan, a senior vice president for San Jose-based Calpine Corp. But, he said, the company has ""no intention of asking for renegotiation"" on its own. 

Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association for electricity generating companies, said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation. So far, he said, ""I don't see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction."" 

And he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table. ""We'd take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations,"" he said. 

For his part, Gov. Gray Davis would be open to renegotiations, said his spokesman, Steve Maviglio, but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table. 

""Would we love to get a better deal?"" Maviglio said. ""Of course we would, but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now, and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts, we'd be the first ones at the table."" 

S. David Freeman, who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state, said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements. When the state began negotiating contracts, California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts. The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat, he said. 

""Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit,"" said Freeman, ""but it's a good thing to have."" 

But William B. Marcus, chief economist for JBS Energy, which conducted the three-month study, noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined. 

The study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a $200,000 grant from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation. It was conducted by JBS, a consulting group. 

The study singled out for criticism: 

* A deal with Sempra Energy, parent company to San Diego Gas & Electric, which Marcus called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts. Over the life of the pact, he calculated, Sempra would earn $1.2 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost. 

The contract lasts until 2011. For each year, it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether it's needed or not. 

* A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co. that have yet to be built. The plants will be ""peakers,"" designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight, such as on hot summer afternoons. The state agreed to pay Calpine $90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity. 

""They get $90 million a year on plants that cost $250 million,"" said Marcus. ""That's huge. You get your money out in three years. If a utility had built these power plants, they would have charged half as much."" 

* A deal with Alliance-Colton LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County. The deal commits the state to pay $207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity. 

* An agreement to pay $150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp. of Atlanta owns in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

* A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp, a private utility based in Portland, Ore. Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of $70 per megawatt-hour. That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winter's crisis, but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed. 

* Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants. The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts, the study said. 

One of the marketers, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., agreed to sell from 150 to 1,000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight $61 per megawatt-hour. 

But a second marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for $62.50 to $87 per megawatt-hour. 

""When you compare those two contracts,"" Marcus said, ""you know you've got a dog here. I think Williams showed up earlier, and the state was desperate."" 

* An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of Houston that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, Marcus said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go. 

* A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

Marcus, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer. 

Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices. 

""The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty,"" said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. ""To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas."" 

When the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire. 

Marcus was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring. 

Another weakness of the contracts, Marcus said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said. 

Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added. 

""I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy,"" Marcus said. 

""I don't want to pay Williams $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin.""

When he emerged in the mid-1980s at the dawn of new traditionalism, Lyle Lovett had more than a craggy visage to set him apart. His subtle wit, sly humor, and Texas-sized musical eclecticism made him a force. Built around 13 songs from his first three albums, this compendium resoundingly affirms those gifts. One hears his musical metamorphosis from the beginning, through the stomping blues of ""Why I Don't Know,"" the honky-tonk talking blues ""Give Back My Heart,"" and the folkier ""L.A.

1.	Focus more on Tariff standardization (I think that this is the key issue for Enron because LMP based bid balancing market is almost a done deal - and the Texas market seems to be fine for liquidity).  Build around a new proforma with a NETWORK PLUS model.
2.	I would highlight that size matters - re-double our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments.
3.	I would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no source/sink requirement.
4.	The gas / power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration (ie, CNG) but because of the geographic reach.  Many LDCs used Columbia p/l, but only one LDC uses AEPs.  The electric market needs transmission to be ""rationalized"" across the marketplace so moving power to where it's needed from where it's at.
5.	Should we attack the 209 Boards?  Agree that they are unnecessary, but pls be careful.

ORR had been discussing jurisdiction with the Department of Justice in the US

3451,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
? Senator Keeley Spearheads a New ""Plan B""
? State to Offer Little Aid in PG&E Bankruptcy

Keeley's Collective ""Plan B""
Sources report that additional details for the Plan B have just been ironed 
out on the Assembly side.  The Assembly is working to announce a plan ""as 
soon as possible""; this announcement could come this afternoon.  If it is not 
this afternoon, it will be later this week.   Sources Report the Republicans 
were working with Keeley, but then felt shut out of the process, so they 
developed a plan of their own (a lightly publicized point last week).  
However, sources believe that the Plan B is very likely to have enough 
Republican support to pass the Assembly.  The Senate will likely be a much 
tougher fight, but opposition to the plan remains pessimistic that they will 
be able to stop it.  The Senate appears likely to broaden the base of people 
who would have to pay the dedicated rate component, which will be unpopular.  
Borrowing from elements of the Joe Nation and Florez ""Plan B's,"" Keeley's new 
plan is said to:
? Set up a dedicated rate component for SoCal to deal with part of their 
undercollect.  This dedicated rate component would apply more to ""high-end 
customers.""  Where the line would be drawn between who would pay and who 
would not is still subject to negotiation.  The size of the dedicated rate 
component is also subject to negotiation.  SoCal has suggested $3M for 10 to 
12 years.  Note, sources report that at this time, a dedicated rate component 
for SoCal to pay for power going forward is NOT included in the Plan B that 
will be announced.  The Assembly is not certain whether this additional 
dedicated rate component will be needed.  If the bond issuance is enough to 
cover the cost of power purchases, no dedicated rate component for forward 
purchases will be needed.  By 2003 and 2004, enough additional generation 
should be online that power prices should be low.  Therefore, the key 
question becomes what will be the cost of power in 2002?  If the cost of 
power is high, rates may have to be increased at that time for SoCal to 
continue operating.
? The state would make a secured loan (secured against the transmission 
assets) to SoCal to pay back the remainder of the undercollect.  This loan 
would be paid back by SoCal granting the government a lower rate of return on 
the transmission system for a period of 10 to 15 years.  This provides an 
incentive for SoCal to sell its transmission system to the state, since it 
would not be making as much money from the system.  Were this to happen, the 
value would be credited toward the loan.
? In return, the state would receive the withdrawal with prejudice of the 
filed rate doctrine case.  Also, SoCal would reduce the price of native power 
generation.  Finally, business customers (including those that would have to 
pay the dedicated rate component) would have the right to apply for direct 
access to power.
If this plan is passed, (better than 50/50 chance -as reported earlier) the 
constitutional challenge from Michael Sturmwasser is still likely to go 
forward.  This is because Sturmwasser is chiefly concerned with the fact that 
the plan results in a retroactive rate increase to pay SoCal's undercollect.  
Sources believe it is likely that SoCal will eventually sell its transmission 
assets to the state if this plan is passed.  Therefore these assets would 
become municipal, making the reduction in the PUC's authority constitutional.

Legislature Leaves PG&E to Throws of Bankruptcy
Today, there have been discussions concerning PG&E regarding ""Plan B"" and the 
legislature.   Currently, the legislature is NOT considering offering 
Keeley's ""Plan B"" solution to PG&E.  If the Plan B mentioned above passes the 
Senate, it is more likely that the state will purchase PG&E out of 
bankruptcy.  Both the Assembly and the Senate leadership are talking 
seriously about purchasing PG&E out of bankruptcy, though the Republicans 
remain strongly opposed.  The state then, would likely sell off pieces of 
PG&E (except for the transmission assets, which it would retain). ",Keeley Spearheads Florez Michael Sturmwasser Sturmwasser,$3M,PG&E Bankruptcy Keeley Assembly Senate the Joe Nation SoCal -as PUC Legislature Leaves PG&E PG&E

3454,"FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders:

EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous 
aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) 
and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in 
APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically 
insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of 
generators in the following provisions:

 -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order 
to seek interconnection
 -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot
 -- Specific milestones must be added
 -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA
 -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load 
 -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study
 -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a 
generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal)
 -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm
 -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to 
satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator 
of      information that affects the generator
 -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety

FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all 
pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation.

Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and 
CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to 
pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may 
incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in 
VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC.  
((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest.  
FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some 
confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing 
customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.))

Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides 
that ""Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long 
as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by 
Transmission Provider up to that point.""  FPL's unfiled procedures allow 
withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers 
includes similar procedures.  

What are ""material changes"" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's 
provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) 
in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the 
move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions 
(unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more 
than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) 
change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the 
length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, 
that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can 
result in loss of queue spot.  

Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.  CP&L 
will provide workpapers used in the studies on request.",VEPCO,,FERC EPMI DENA Arizona Public Service's IA APS CP&L EPMI/Duke Transmission Provider FPL Consumer's IAs

In attendence from Enron were Rogers Herndon, Marc Ulrich, Jeff Merola, Bra=

During the course of the meeting, we delivered our message that we, like Co=
mEd, wanted to see a competitive market emerge in Illinois, but that we had=
 concern that lifting the PPO early without the presence of a competitive m=
arket could create a California-like situation - which is what they were st=
riving to avoid - because their approach would leave buyers on the competit=
ive market without having any sellers due to problems with physical deliver=
y.  We indicated our concern for our existing customers and our ability to =
grow our business in Illinois.  We stressed the PJM model as a workable sol=
ution that creates a liquid market.  There was much enthusiasm on the part =
of ComEd for focusing ICC attention on creating that kind of a solution for=
 Illinois.  Arlene Juracek encouraged us to work with them on this and to m=

tion to the ICC and then for Mike to make a presentation the following day,=
 we are going to try and meet with them.

One of our objectives was to set up a team between Enron and ComEd to go th=

s.  This was accomplished and Jeff Merola and Mark Ulrich witll be meeting =
 with Ann McGlin at ComEd to get a better understanding of what we can and =
cannot do to achieve physical delivery.  Also, Michael Freeman indicated a =
willingness to sell us a structured retail product to help us achieve physi=
cal delivery (energy and/or load following services), and made it clear tha=
t whatever deal we do with the Exelon Power team would be independent and s=
eparate from any deal we might do with ComEd on the PPO front.  Once we hav=
e completed our discussions with Ann McGlin and with Michael Freeman, we wi=

We also discussed other aspects of the ComEd letter to the ICC and received=
 the following clarifications.  Customers going off the PPO before 2004 wou=

go to real time pricing on a day ahead or hourly basis.  As to whether the =
CTC could be reinstated after a customer was dropped from PPO, they indicat=
ed that they had not thought about it, but believed the law would allow thi=
s.  Arlene Juracek, however, commented that they could lock in a CTC agreem=
ent with a customer.  I interpret that to mean that as part of an agreement=
 to support ComEd in its proposal, we may be able to guarantee that for our=
 customers, the CTC will not reemerge if market prices go down or that we c=
an negotiate a limited CTC, etc. =20

We also pointed out that we had other concerns like ComEd's unwillingness t=
o negotiate the Supplier Agreement.  Not much time was spent on that but my=
 sense is that if this is an obstacle to getting our concurrence, we may be=
 able to work through this as well.

Frank Clark asked us about our willingness to take on the role of supplier =
of last resort and we responded that we needed first to be sure that we cou=

Here is a summary of the work of this task force.  Bill Rust has been 
attending  the meetings and I have been closley coordinating our positions.

The PFTF set out to develop a means to capture native load impacts (not 
tagged) in load flow models to ensure that parallel flows resulting from 
native load dispatch are accounted for accurately to assess system security.  
This has largely been ignored in the past since most TLRs hit only non-firm 
PTP transactions.  However, the NERC TLR procedures (in line with FERC OATT) 
requires a pro-rata curtailment of native and network service with Firm 
point-to-point (PTP).  Since more and more TLRs at Level 5 (Firm) have been 
utilized and is expected to rise, providers are being forced by the MIC to 
demonstrate comparability at these TLR levels.  In order to demonstrate 
comparability - a transparent calculation of Native and Network impacts is 
needed.  In past, this was left to the discretion of each control area. 

The task force reviewed 7 methods on how to model native gen to native load 
dispatch.  

These seven methods can be grouped into three categories:
1) Continue with the existing method that does not consider counterflows.
2) Inlcude counterflows for NNL (Native/Network Load) and PTP and assign to 
sink control area.
3) Assign NNL counterflows to the control area and PTP counterflows to the 
purchasing selling entitiy (PSE). 

Each method tries to simulate real-time dispatch realizing that an 
interconnection-wide state estimator is not available nor a nodal dispatch 
model.
 
The simplest methods (group 1) adjust each generator individually to a set of 
load points in its control area and repeats until all the units in the 
control area are accounted for.   The problem for the transmission owners 
with this approach is that the netting effects of the real-time dispatch are 
not captured therfore exaggerating the impacts a control area has on its 
neighbors. Group 1 solutions were rejected because the task force beleived 
that its parent, the Security Subcommittee (Dick Ingersoll member) insisted 
on a new procedure that included counterflows - for security reasons.

The initial proposal to include netted effects (Group 2) allows control areas 
to net NNL flows within the control area and PTP to net flows that are 
grouped by sink control area. Group 2 solutions were rejected because PSEs 
would not get credit for off-setting transactions that sink in other control 
areas, e.g. I have a PTP that sinks in TVA that off-sets a PTP that sinks in 
SOCO. Group 2 solutions would not give credit for this.

The most complex method (group 3) allows the native load dispatch to net 
their impacts with all internal gen-load pairings AND nets the contributions 
of point-to-point tagged transactions by PSE.  This is the most equitable 
solution for the market, however it is the most costly and demanding solution 
for the transmission owner/operators. Group 3 solutions were acceptable to 
all parties because it assigned credit to those who are sponsoring 
transactions that relieve the flow gate loading.

Lately, I have been pushed in NERC activities to make calls that boil down to 
what is fair and equitable between native loads and point-to-point service 
vs. what increased burden and accountability on providers is needed to 
provide for that level of comparability.

We should always hold providers to the higher standard.  That is - it is not 
easy to facilitate market transactions, and yes - real people and real 
dollars are needed to be expended by providers to continue facilitating an 
increasingly complex and evolving marketplace.  Providers cannot be let off 
the hook and be allowed to do what is easy and least cost - this has proven 
over and over to have negative impact on the market.",Kevin Bill Rust Inlcude counterflows NNL counterflows Dick Ingersoll,,NERC FERC PTP MIC TLR Native and Network NNL the Security Subcommittee TVA PSE
3459,"I don't know that NERC has ""given up"" on Enron.  The timing of next week's meeting to ""resolve"" the legislation  reflects the legislative realities that the committees of jurisdiction in Congress will take up the realibility legislation, along with other electricity issues, as early as the second week of September.  In fact, congressional staff in the Senate and House are drafting legislative language on electricity issues during the August recess.  They have pressed the ""coalition"" for a final work product.

I gathered that at least some of what Jeff'spresentation to the NERC board would be about concerns matters beyond the legislation as such, but since they go to the NERC board's operation and independence, may go to our comfort level with NERC as the standards setting organization.

Given the issues and concerns that have been addressed and communicated to NERC, and our preference for the PJM model (as Jeff told John Q. Anderson in the conference call), I think NERC got the information it wanted to get out of the call even though it didn't like the answers: i.e., whether Sarah and I have been faithfully representing Enron's position, whether Enron supports an ""SRO"" type organization; and whether there is anything they can do to get us on board.

Perhaps we should have another conference call early next week so that Sarah and I have our guidance from everyone going into the August 9th meeting.  For one thing, we need to determine if we are in any position to provide detailed comments on the ""shortened NERC"" version at the August 9th meeting or whether we do not wish to engage them on what specific changes it would take to get us on board.

My sense is that since we have to deal with the players in the room on other issues, our overall position will be strengthened if we have some specific comments to make to explain our decision not to support NERC's version, even the shortened one.  Don't get me wrong -- we have plenty of good reasons not to, I just wasn't sure how ""engaged"" we wanted to be in identifying changes that would bring us on board since I gather our opposition is more fundamental (no Western deference, budget concerns, independence issues, etc.).

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Declares Bankruptcy

by Will McNamara 
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (NYSE: PCG), the utility unit of PGOCorp., on 
Friday filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco. 
The company said it is taking this action in light of its uncollected energy 
costs, which are now increasing by more than $300 million per month; 
continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the company; and the 
now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Gov. Gray Davis and his 
representatives are going nowhere. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. reportedly has 
more than $9 billion in uncollected costs for wholesale power purchases. 
Neither PGOCorp. nor any of its other subsidiaries, including its National 
Energy Group, have filed for Chapter 11 reorganization or are affected by the 
utility's filing.  

Analysis: Despite the fact that Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy 
filing has been in the making for several months, and that its financial 
insolvency appeared inevitable, the actual filing for Chapter 11 protection 
on Friday caught many by surprise, including California's top officials. 
Ironically, the utility's 13 million customers may end up being the least 
impacted by the bankruptcy, as Pacific Gas & Electric Co. will remain in the 
business of providing power while it works its way through bankruptcy court. 
However, there is little doubt that the bankruptcy filing of California's 
largest utility will spark many reverberations throughout the state and 
across the country, the full impact of which is not presently known.  

There naturally is a great deal of industry press surrounding this major 
news, so I won't waste time regurgitating information that is being widely 
disseminated. Rather, I will focus on what I believe to be some of the key 
elements of this story. 

1. The bankruptcy was announced the day after it became clear to PGOthat the 
state of California would not be purchasing its transmission assets at a 
price that PGObelieves the assets to be worth. In addition, a new rate 
increase approved by the governor could not be used to repay any of Pacific 
Gas & Electric Co.'s  existing debts. The night before the bankruptcy filing, 
Gov. Davis delivered a televised address to the state in which he indicated 
that the rate increases would be contingent on PGOselling the transmission 
assets to the state. In other words, if PGOagreed to the state's price for 
the transmission assets, a portion of the rate increase would be used to 
alleviate the utility's subsequent debts. The inside word is that Pacific Gas 
& Electric Co. was finally driven to its bankruptcy decision due to 
disagreements with Gov. Davis regarding the price of the transmission assets, 
which could be anywhere from $3 billion to $9 billion. Officially, Pacific 
Gas & Electric Co. said that its negotiations with the state ""were going 
nowhere."" The CPUC had previously approved rate increases of up to 46 percent 
for the customers of SCE and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., but clearly 
stipulated that none of this added revenue could be used to pay off existing 
debt. In his statewide address on the eve of the bankruptcy, Gov. Davis 
reluctantly announced an additional rate increase for non-residential 
customers that would average about 26.5 percent. Davis had fiercely resisted 
any form of a rate increase to accommodate Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s debt. 
The official PGOresponse to both increases was that they were insufficient to 
pay off existing debts of the utility operation. 

2. PGOCorp. and other non-utility subsidiaries are not impacted by the 
bankruptcy measure (at least for now). Due to a shrewd financial 
restructuring that was approved by FERC a few months ago (see 1/12/01 Issue
Alert for more information), high-profit subsidiaries such as National Energy 
Group and PGOGas Transmission Northwest Corp. were placed into a 
special-purpose, bankruptcy remote entity known as GTN Holdings LLC. 
Consequently, these non-regulated subsidiaries (along with the parent 
corporation) may not be impacted by the utility's bankruptcy filing. The U.S. 
federal bankruptcy judge ultimately may take a closer look at how profits 
were divided among the parent operation and other non-regulated subsidiaries, 
but for the time being only Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has declared 
bankruptcy. 

3. Power suppliers still owed money by PGOcould likely never get paid. Much 
of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s $9 billion debt is owed to power suppliers 
that sold power to the utility over the last year or so. With the onset of 
lengthy legal proceedings, it becomes more unlikely that these power 
suppliers will be paid what they are owed any time soon. Consequently, power 
suppliers owed more than $100 million by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. also saw 
their stocks drop as a reaction to the bankruptcy announcement. According to 
a report in Reuters, Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) was down $2.65 or 6.25 percent 
at $30.75; Dynegy Corp. (NYSE: DYN) was off $2.58 or 5.07 percent at $48.34; 
Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB) was $2.26 or 5.4 percent lower at $39.60; and 
Reliant Energy (NYSE: REI) lost $2.70 or 5.95 percent to $42.65. In addition, 
there is the real question of whether or not such power suppliers will be 
willing to provide power used by a bankrupt company (even if the state of 
California remains involved as the buying intermediary). For its part, 
PGOCorp. Chairman Bob Glynn said that the utility subsidiary intends to 
eventually ""pay all our debt"" in full but he did not report a specific 
figure. In addition to the power suppliers, banks that have provided loans to 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (such as Bank of America, Wells Fargo and J.P. 
Morgan Chase) could all be impacted by the bankruptcy. Pacific Gas & Electric 
Co.'s preliminary bankruptcy filing lists its top creditor as Bank of New 
York, to which it owes more than $2.2 billion. Although some payments may be 
made after years of litigation, such lenders and bondholders may be forced to 
write off billions of dollars that were previously advanced to Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. as losses.  

4. The blame game is in full force. Davis and state regulators have 
repeatedly blamed out-of-state generators for price gouging and federal 
regulators for failing to impose wholesale rate caps on electricity prices. 
Also, Gov. Davis has issued harsh words against PG&E. Over the weekend, Davis 
appeared on two nationally televised news programs to berate PGOfor awarding 
an estimated $50 million in bonuses and raises to about 6,000 midlevel 
managers and support staff on the eve of the utility's bankruptcy filing. 
""Management at PGOis just focused upon padding their own pockets, not in 
discharging their duty to serve their many customers in California,"" Davis 
reportedly said. Earlier, Davis had previously issued a statement saying 
PGO""management is suffering from two afflictions: denial and greed."" In 
addition, California regulators have criticized FERC for not implementing 
wholesale price caps in the Western region, which they believe would help to 
stabilize the market in California. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that, ""it 
is inexcusable that FERC has refused to intervene and provide temporary 
stability and reliability [through the use of wholesale price caps]."" 
Feinstein vowed to introduce legislation to force federally mandated price 
caps for the entire Western region. For its part, FERC refused to take 
responsibility for the California crisis, saying instead that Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co.'s bankruptcy filing was ""the unfortunate result of a massive 
failure by policymakers at all levels."" PGOblames decisions made by the CPUC 
and Gov. Davis that it believes ""undermined"" its ability to return to 
financial viability and recover its uncollected costs. Specifically, 
PGOblames the California government for not allowing it to recover prior 
wholesale power costs through recent rate increases, which essentially has 
kept the utility in a debt situation. PGOalso believed that the governor was 
not moving quickly enough to reach an agreement regarding the sale of PG&E's 
transmission system to the state.  Consumer groups continue to lambaste the 
utility and its parent company, which they claim has $30 billion in available 
capital that could have been used to pull its subsidiary out of debt.  

5. Could the bankruptcy filing of SCE be far behind? The second-largest 
utility in California continues to maintain that it intends to avoid 
bankruptcy and it believes it can work out a ""comprehensive solution to our 
current crisis."" However, because the two utilities have been so closely 
linked through the state's energy crisis, PG&E's decision to declare 
bankruptcy certainly raises the odds that SCE will eventually follow suit. In 
fact, Moody's Investors Service is reporting that Pacific Gas and Electric 
Co.'s bankruptcy increases the possibility of an SCE bankruptcy filing. 
Further, Moody's is reporting that numerous creditor groups, particularly the 
small generators, have become impatient with the time that it has taken to 
advance settlement discussions with the state of California, thereby 
increasing the prospects for an involuntary petition by a group of creditors. 
On April 6, the day of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy filing, shares 
of SCE tumbled $4.29, or nearly 34 percent, to finish trading at $8.35. 
Surprisingly, SCE shares jumped about $2.00 by mid-morning on April 9, to 
trade at about $10.00. The reason for the increase is not fully known, 
although SCE continues to remain involved in negotiations with Gov. Davis 
regarding its own outstanding debt. 

6. This is just the start of a long, drawn out legal process. The electric 
utilities that previously declared bankruptcy (including El Paso Electric, 
Public Service Company of New Hampshire and El Paso Electric) all found 
themselves embroiled in legal proceedings for several years. Thus, although 
we may not know the ultimate outcome for Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s 
bankruptcy proceedings, we do know that the company will be essentially 
consumed with litigation and a thorough investigation of its financial 
records for the foreseeable future. Federal Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali 
of San Francisco has been assigned the PGOcase. Montali will have the 
ultimate power to approve or reject any plan for how PGOreorganizes or 
arranges to repay its debt. Several positive elements of the process that 
might work to PG&E's advantage is that the utility will now be held 
accountable to only one individual, Judge Montali. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. 
will no longer have to appease several regulatory entities across state and 
federal lines. Second, by the time that the bankruptcy proceedings are 
completed, market dynamics hopefully will have improved and California's 
supply problem should be resolved. Consequently, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. 
could eventually rise again, like the phoenix out of its ashes, and emerge as 
a much stronger company than it is today.

her.  Most of her comments we could not accept.  None of her comments have 
been run by Dave.

2. Imperial Oil -  Grant Oh was handling this.  They had 3 comments. most of 
which we could not accept.  I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and 
have never heard back from him.  None of their proposed changes have been run 
by Dave.

3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has 
approved was sent to them on May 15th.  My contact there is Jim Sobule  Wayne

4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March.

on this.  None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave.

5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick  on January 31st 
which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.  Dave 
has not reviewed their comments or my response.

6. Cargill - I sent to Mike Pederson a form of amendment letter which I don't 
think has been signed.  They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality 
language.  Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to 
life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it.

7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John

Tana came into my office last night and seemed to be very upset about how the 
other 2 legal assistants were treating her, especially Susan Bailey, and also 
about the fact taht Susan Bailey was going to be part of Samantha's training 
and that this was a surprise to her.  On the latter issue, I explained to her 
that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it 
made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's 
training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff.  I am 
very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process 
given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous.  
The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't 
tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's 
way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.  I explained to her 
that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha's 
training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was 
more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training.

On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to 
work better is through ""communicating"" to each other.  I firmly believe taht 
there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the 
other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.  Tana of course will not admit 
this.  I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired 
of hearing about why they can't get along.  I also told Tana taht it was my 
perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her 
increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude 
which even I have noticed has been a little different lately.

I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this 
to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided.

As I indicated in my voice mail message I have the following questions about 
the maternity leave policy:

1. I am assuming that any vacation time that I still have left I can use up 
at 100% pay.

2. My understanding is that in order to go beyond the 6 week period I would 
need a letter from my doctor indicating the medical condition that exists and 
justifying sick leave pay at 90%

3. If I want to take after the 6 week period an unpaid leave of absence, 
whose approval do I need?  Does unpaid leave affect any of my current 
benefits (i.e., options that are due to vest, medical, parking etc.)  If I am 
on unpaid leave and Enron offers a stock option program at year end, am I 
still eligible?

I have done some research into the issue of whether the CPUC would be able
to restate the UDC's PX Energy Charges (and thus PX Credits) back to October
if the FERC were to apply its mitigation plan back that far. Thus far, my
research indicates that the answer is yes (or at least there is a strong
argument that the answer is yes) and it would not violate the rule against
retroactive rate making.  The reasoning is as follows:

The Commission (as affirmed by the courts) have ruled that they may subject
a utility's rates to refund to account for adjustments made pursuant to a
methodology or formula adopted before the date the utility's rates became
subject to refund. Thus any ratemaking is considered prospective because the
formulas are in place before the utility's rates are made subject to refund.
The PX Energy Charge is calculated pursuant to the formula/mechanism set
forth in the utility's tariffs.  These charges were always subject to
adjustment on a prospective basis due to the settlement process.  The change
in energy prices which would be effected by the FERC ruling could very well
be viewed as an adjustment made pursuant to a formula.  Thus the change
would not be considered retroactive ratemaking.

I had a chance to talk with Mike Day for a couple of minutes about this
issue.  He concurred with my analysis.

3551,"I have drafted a detailed outline on our receivables due from the underscheduling penalty.  Because the penalty has not been implemented by the CAISO, our case needs to clearly lay out the CAISO has failed to implement FERC orders and what our receivable is even though we have no invoices to rely on.

The biggest ""to dos"" on this are: (1) update our receivable amount to the extent we can get more data from CAISO (we have asked for data informally from CAISO), (2) lodge discovery questions re: the computation of our receivable (I drafted questions in Section 5), and (3) review Enron's past positions on this matter.

I am assuming that sections 1. and 2. will go in our pleading and/or policy testimony and that sections 3. AND 4. will be beefed up and/or updated by Murray O'Neil (with help from Stokley and Blair).

3568,"Entergy has joined the SE Trans RTO (Southern, etal).  I will review the FERC filing; however, an Entergy rep called me today to ask for Enron's support stating that the new RTO proposal includes:
 
-- Independent Market Operator (he said such as PJM)
-- No Day Ahead Balanced Schedules
-- LMP
-- One OASIS and one Tariff (no separate tariff for Entergy's ITC)
-- One Security Coordinator
-- Initial license plate rate within Entergy area
-- local planning in Entergy footprint
 
He also said that they are trying to have the GridSouth group agree to use the same Independent Market Operator so there would be one market structure for the Southeast.
 
Hopefully, the filing reflects this -- more later.  Christi

 ",Jim,$,
3570,"My thoughts --

1.	Great job.
2.	I would change the message in the conclusion (and elsewhere) that the work should be done at the same time -- The Commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of RTOs, WHILE ALSO WORKING and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these RTOs.  
3.	Thanks for getting in ""Network Plus"" - it's the little things that matter.
4.	Maybe strengthen that just standardizing is not enough - real integration across seams is imperative. NY and PJM have same tariff same model but haven't worked well for a long time.

Thanks.

T",Joe,,

Did you watch the same game I saw?  Apparently not.  The Horns looked awesome.  Alot better than that team you root for.  You wish you went to UT, don't you?!

Did you have a good time last night?  Find a cute little Texas girl to fall in love with?  There are plenty of them in Austin.  If I hear no stories, I know you had a really good time.

3591,"Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.",,an additional of $1 billion,Standard & Poor's S&P Enron BBB EnronOnline

Alstott's performance against Minnesota.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Tacos U=
pdated 10/29/01 Davis was inactive for Sunday's game, although he claimed h=
e felt healthy enough to play. According to the Denver Post, there is no cl=
ear indication of when the Broncos will use Davis again. ""He never practice=
d last week with the first team,"" Mike Shanahan said.  Ryan L! ea!   , QB D=
AL - Free Agent Updated 10/29/01 Leaf was the No. 2 QB vs. Arizona and did =
not play on Sunday. As of now, it is not clear who will start for the Cowbo=
ys at New York. Clint Stoerner may have played well enough to get the call =
again next week.  Jim Miller , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/29/01 Miller =
(hip) will be further evaluated on Monday. According to some published repo=
rts, he should be available for Chicago's next game.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF =

at San Diego. The injury is not serious, says the Buffalo News. He also hur=

01 Pittman suffered a concussion in Sunday's game at Dallas. His current st=
atus is day to day.  James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 10/29/01 Stewar=
t was inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Lamont Warren started=

But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he exp=
ects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith =
would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was =

rding to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's ga=
me against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action. ! Eddie K=
ennison , WR DEN - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for=
 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideou=
t has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of product=
ivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rush=
ed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an=
 eight-yard run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times f=
or 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson t=
his year.  David Patten, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught =
five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a sco=
ring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  =
Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 y=
ards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Br=
own will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on =
the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/28/0=
1 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Con=
way was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and st=
aying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy=
 wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Kar Bombs Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcam=
e a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for fiv=
e yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now g=
et much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to pr! ef! er=
 his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone=
.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - G money Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to=
 eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want=
 to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't ex=
pect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Free =
Agent Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at =
San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved e=
nough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - =
Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing=
 for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some=
 troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important=
 downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - God Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held =
Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Consi! de! ring the strength of the Mi=
ami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumb=
led twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but t=
he league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden=
 , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 ya=
rds at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anyt=
hing more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle,=
 but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occ=
asionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Day=
ne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putt=
ing up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy tea=
ms right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Toomer c=
aught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a m=
ust-start Fantasy player, no matt! er! what the opposition is.  Stephen Dav=
is , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards agains=
t the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running f=
or good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they =
are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/=
01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants=
. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy =
reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Staley played =
Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three ca=
rries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raide=
rs' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it=
 bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, wh=
ich suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes=
 both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Updated 10/28/=
01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdo! wn! Sunday at Philade=
lphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured b=

Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.  The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.  The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas.

These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets.

Enron North America-Upstream Products
Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. 
Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu.  
Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.
ENA West Power
Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

IN THE NEWS

""To truly understand Enron's Jeffrey Skilling - the hypersmart, hyperconfident chief executive of what may now be the largest energy trading company on the planet - head to your local video store and check out that classic American cinema, Wayne's World.  At 15, Skilling helped launch a no-budget television station in Aurora, Illinois - the very thing that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey so famously spoofed on Saturday Night Live and in two movies.  The TV skit even begins with a sketch of a teenage cameraman, the role of the real-life Skilling."" ",Mt.

that can help.

Crosscurrents
MAUS CULTURE
by Peter Swanson
Mar 29 | ""It seems there's a movement afoot to class-up comic books -- both
adult comics, by moving them out of the ghetto of specialty stores and
sci-fi racks, and kids comics, by giving them a significant place in our
pop-culture canon. I do not doubt for a moment the artistic merits of many
of the books and writers in the comics field, adult or otherwise. What I
wonder about is this sudden bid for legitimacy. If some of these upstarts
find themselves lodged between the Styrons and the Tans on the big people
shelves, will they still talk to the superhero comics?"" From DC and Marvel
to the latest wave of serious graphic novels, the comic book has come of
age. Peter Swanson surveys the scene, and waxes just a bit nostalgic.

A. L. KENNEDY: SPASMS OF GRACE
by Julia Livshin
Mar 29 | ""There's no bloodlust. And even with a very good matador and a
very good bull, the nature of the thing is that it isn't seamless and it
can't be entirely graceful. There will be spasms of grace. It's a very odd,
ramshackle thing. There are all kinds of strange pauses and clumsy bits,
and patches of costume drama, and then patches of this very odd, sometimes
beautiful communication."" A conversation with the Scottish novelist A. L.
Kennedy, whose new book, *On Bullfighting*, describes the ""death,
transcendence, immortality, joy, pain, isolation and fear"" that is the
Spanish corrida.

POINTS OF INTEREST
by Robert Cohen
Mar 21 | ""And then, I don't know, there was something about the way they
looked that made me think: remember this. The light, the bees humming in
the grass, the lazy inconsequential flow of the afternoon, and your
daughter, your irritable knock-kneed eight-and-a-half year old daughter,
who will never be just this way again, just this tanned and skinny and
unselfconscious, this careless, careless.... I didn't think about it after
that. It was all reflex.""

KAREN ARMSTRONG: DIVINE RETICENCE
by Harvey Blume
Mar 21 | ""When I first began the study of religion, I found it difficult to
get a handle on Buddhism. It didn't have any of the things I considered
essential to religion, like a supernatural God, a sense of sin, authority
figures, doctrines. But the more I got into religious studies, the more I
began to think that this approach, this reticence about the divine, had a
good deal to recommend it."" Harvey Blume talks with the author of *Buddha*,
the biography of a world-historical figure about whom nothing is truly
known.

Houston about processing rebates.  He explained that when applying for the 
rebate, have the rebate check payable to Enron.  Send the rebate check in on 
a Deposit Transmittal Form, and code it with the same codes you had used to 
process the initial expense (company #, expense code and cost center to which 
the rebate should be credited).  If a Deposit Transmittal Form is unavailable 
to you, you can just staple the check to a piece of paper showing the 
appropriate codes.  Mail this deposit form with the rebate check via 
inter-company mail to:  Treasury, Sam Round EB2703.

3643,"I just finally heard back from the traders on this deal. Apparently, Idaho's 
schedule was cut by the ISO on Sunday, and therefore, we had to cut our sale 
to them. The deal was originally 25 mw on peak, but was cut about 10 mw each 
hour. That's why each hour now shows 15 mw and some scraps. The remainder of 
the schedule we sold in the hour ahead market. This is a typical maneuver 
when the ISO cuts schedules, but I guess you guys haven't had to confirm 
daily deals in this situation before. Let me know if this is going to be a 
problem, and we'll figure something out.

3686,"Meet the head of the leading firm in our business.

Imagine the opportunity!

Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run 
the  company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North 
America.

So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a 
co-owner assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or 
three.

To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with a 
commitment from AOL to promote NewPower's wares.  You do an IPO and take in 
about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO is over and the quiet period 
it required.  But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your 
energy at the best price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get 
up front 30 Enron-trained   risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine 
having to recruit them?

To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene 
Lockhart,  most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before 
that president of BankAmerica's Global Retail Bank with its consumer, 
commercial and small business banking services delivered through 3,000+ 
branches.

Now, Lockhart's talking about his plans.

Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in detail 
(to read the full story see attachment):

? How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is the 
heart of NewPower's business plan?
? How they'll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin.
? How he's going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a million 
by the end of 2001.
? What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What figure 
is he using for cost of customer acquisition?
? Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest the 
second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest unregulated 
retail  marketer in the US.
? How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm?
? What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005?
? What does he see as his biggest challenge?
? Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets?
? Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed?
? What's the role of backward dating in forward market margins?
? Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a bill, 
what kind of margin can it make now?
? How do higher prices help NewPower?  ""We're actually in a very good 
position given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our 
favor ... ""
? ""We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a 
bill, collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone 
else in the industry by several orders of magnitude.""

3689,"Attached is the FINAL Name Change/Merger report for March 2001.  Please note 
that the most recent overlays are on top because unlike the others, prior 
notification has not been given.  These were just done last night and this 
morning.  For the complete report, go to the bottom tab, ""March 2001"".

The shortname changes will be coordinated with ERMS IT today, Fri, 03/23/01.

Records will be inactivated on Mon, April 2, 2001.

FYI - On the Feb 2001 report, there were several PG&E entities that went 
through name changes to El Paso entities.  There were also 3 TECO 
conversions.  We did not have the documentation to support those changes, as 
noted on the report.  As of 03/22/01, all documentation for those changes are 
in hand.

Regarding the Coastal/El Paso merger, the documents that support name changes 
as a result of that merger, have been received.  If you are interested in 
more details regarding the remaining entities, they are attached below.

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile

Subject: Exempt Market Declaration - Australia

Today I spoke to the Jillian Segall, National Commissioner of the Australian 
Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).   I have arranged a meeting  
with her and staff handling our application next Wednesday afternoon. Paul 
and I will go and we will take Mallesons. I have foreshadowed to her that we 
would be willing to withdraw and resubmit our application (addressing 
credit/prudential issues as ASIC staff had suggested to Mallesons). However 
we would like to explain face to face the circumstances. I said that we 
didn't want any impression that Enron had either lost interest or were acting 
in a fit of pique. Quite the contrary we see the grant of the Exempt Market 
Declaration as critical and appreciate their efforts to date. (Considering 
Paul Q's well known aversion to blunt talking I thought it wise to foreshadow 
what we wanted to cover, as follows.) 
We understand that unless we can comply with the exact requirements of Policy 
Statement 70 (para 50) then ASIC believes it is required to make new policy 
and could not act within the time frame we require. The Minister's office 
indicated he could not attend the launch of a product that was the subject of 
an EMD application. Withdrawing the application whilst we clarify the credit 
issues would remove this timing pressure from ASIC.
We have made the determination that an EMD is not required for us to launch 
weather products on EOL. That being  the grant of an EMD (especially with 
CLERP 6 coming early next year) is the regulatory certainty that Enron would 
require if its plans to develop Sydney as a regional centre were are to 
progress.
I indicated we would also be expressing our suggestions on ASIC concerns with 
procedures that purport to oversee creditworthiness of market participants.

In essence it was a most positive discussion. Assuming all falls into place 
we can maintain our strategy of using the political support to get an EMD 
whilst  allowing  the launch to go ahead next month. Enron Australia is also 
seen as conciliatory to ASIC's concerns whilst maintaining the pressure.

Paul (Simons) we appreciate your ongoing help. We also understand the 
sensitivity at present re an EEFT guarantee.

3756,"Mark, further to our converstaion this morning, I attach the latest version 
of the swap financing structure with RBC DS.  The idea is to have the swaps 
prepay a funded amount which is then repaid through the swap structure over 
the term of the transactions (1 year).  Please note that rather than 
determining the one year PV value of the funded amount and interest at time = 
0 relative to a fixed price, with monthly settlements then occuring in the 
normal course based on market movements, I understand that it is neceassary 
to have interest payments settled monthly with a bullet principal repayment 
by settlement at the end of the one year term.

Some explanatory notes:

1.  Bill Bradford's group is putting the credit terms together.  Once that 
occurs we will need to have drafts to RBC DS ASAP.

2.  Enron Canada Corp.'s obligations will be guaranteed by Enron Corp. to the 
extent outlined in the credit worksheet.

3.  It is fundamental to the structure for Global Finance that there not be 
any net collateral exposure.  In other words, collateral thresholds must 
offset or mirror each other such that if, for exapmle, Enron Canada is 
required to provide $50MM of margin to RBC DS,  Financing SPV will also have 
to provide $50MM of margin to Enron Canada Corp., notwithstanding that Enron 
Canada Corp. ought really not be exposed unless there is a market movement 
having an exposure value in excess of the funded amount of $300MM.  (NOTE:  
The actual amount required to complete the purchase of the PPA is 
C$235,840,000, the first installment of C$58,960,000 having already been 
funded by an intercompany loan from Enron Canada Corp. to Enron Canada Power 
Corp.)

4.  In terms of documentation, the swaps should be documented under ISDA 
Masters.  I understand that there may be an ISDA Master in place between 
Royal Bank of Camada and Enron North America Corp. and also one in place also 
with Enron Corp. (this will need to be confirmed).  As the transactions need 
to be at the Enron Canada Corp. level, however, I suggest that ISDA Masters 
need to be prepared between Enron Canada Corp. and RBC DS and between Enron 
Canada Corp. and Financing SPV on the same terms as the current ISDA Master 
between Enron North America Corp. (or Enron Corp.) and Royal Bank of Canada, 
subject to the credit terms provided by Credit.  The individual transactions 
themselves would then be documentd on transaction Confirmation Letters.  I am 
not fussed as to who prepares the paper and it might be easiest for your 
group to do so.  Please also note that external legal opinions may be 
required in respect of Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Corp.  Blakes is prepared 
to provide legal opinions for Enron Canada Corp. and whatever advice or 
support is necessary.

5.  Once the funding occurs to Enron Canada Corp., it will be advanced by 
intercompany loan to Enron Canada Power Corp. to acquire the PPA, and I will 
look after this aspect of the transaction.

6.  Please note that Enron Canada Power Corp. must put the Government in 
funds on Friday Spetember 22nd.

in italics.  Some of Bob's concerns are covered by current DealBench 
agreements (e.g., site license and access agreements).  

Today, Bob, Mark Taylor and I discussed possible EOL exchange related issues 
involved in a DealBench/EOL auction relationship.  The analysis may be 
complicated by unrelated DealBench exchange issues raised by other DealBench 
business plans.  Based upon a subsequent discussion with Suresh this 
afternoon, EOL exchange issues may be alleviated by latest plan to include a 
separate DealBench powered area within EOL for auctions with a link to 
DealBench merely for PR purposes (rather than a link from EOL to DealBench 
for EOL auctions to be conducted on DealBench).  Other unrelated exchange 
issues noted in outline may still need to be resolved depending upon 
DealBench business plans.  

As Suresh and I discussed, we need to further discuss some of the issues 
raised in the outline as DealBench business plans further develop.  Please 
keep in mind that we (legal) may need some lead time to resolve issues, 
particularly if regulatory authorities are involved (e.g, we decide to seek 
SEC or CFTC no-action relief).

Herb on TheStreet: Why Short-Sellers Are Still Courting Pre-Paid Legal
Services

By Herb Greenberg
Senior Columnist
12/6/00 6:31 AM ET

For the better part of two years, this column has, in one form or
another, pointed out accounting and growth-related issues with Pre-Paid
Legal Services(PPD:NYSE), a multilevel marketing company that sells the
legal equivalent of HMOs. (LMOs?) Yet, even taking into account a brief
stumble in its stock price a year ago, after its cash flow had taken a
dip, Pre-Paid has always come through with higher earnings.

The company has gone so far as to trumpet those higher earnings with a
reminder, in a recent press release, that it has landed on lists of
best companies and fast growers compiled by Forbes, Bloomberg and
Investors Business Daily. Never mind that short-sellers often mine
those very lists for new ideas. (You can't help but wonder how some of
them created such high growth!) Never mind that the metrics used by
those publications don't look at the quality of those earnings. (Those
kinds of lists generally look at the raw numbers that are spit out by a
computer.)

Earnings quality (or lack thereof) has always been the main attraction,
among short-sellers, to the Pre-Paid story. There are a number of
reasons, but perhaps the most simple: Pre-Paid operates on what I like
to call the going-up-the-down-escalator type of business model; it has
to run faster and faster just to keep up. Or, as is the case with
Pre-Paid, it has to write more and more new policies to compensate for
commissions owed by salespeople. Commissions owed by salespeople? Read
on.

Most of Pre-Paid's salespeople are paid three years' worth of
commissions at the time a contract is sold. Members can drop a contract
after the first month and, according to the company, 40% drop out
within the first year. To counter each cancellation -- and not lose on
commissions they've already received -- salespeople must sell
additional memberships against those commissions (or pay interest on
the outstanding balance.) In order for those commissions not to come
back and haunt the company, it would seem membership growth would have
to be constantly accelerating, in order to rise faster than the
commission advances on previous policies sold.

However, just the opposite is happening; and while commission advances
continue to grow, new membership growth is slowing: On an annual basis
it leapt by 27% last quarter -- impressive until you see that it rose
by 40% in the same quarter a year earlier. More to the point: New
membership growth has been falling every quarter for the last four,
barely budging last quarter at 1.4% after peaking at 10.5% in last
year's fourth quarter.



Yet, talk to Pre-Paid's loquacious CEO Harland Stonecipher about
slowing membership growth and it's almost as if he didn't hear the
question. He talks about the 27% growth rate as if it's impressive. ""We
think it can be up 50% or better,"" he says.

So, I ask, what about the falling sequential growth rate? ""I hadn't
really looked at that,"" he says. (The CEO hadn't looked at the
sequential growth rate?!) ""But on an annual basis,"" he continues, ""it's
a good growth rate, and we feel good about that. We've been able to
have 30 quarters of increased revenues and increased earnings; we think
we will be able to continue that.""

But the company hasn't changed its allowance for doubtful accounts --
the amount it reserves against uncollected commissions on cancelled
policies -- for five quarters despite a rise in commission advances.
Chief Operating Officer Randy Harp explains that the company has seen
no need to do so, because 20% of the salesforce does 80% of the sales,
""and where 80% of the production comes from 20% of the salesforce,"" he
says, ""collectibility becomes better; it's a component of not how much
business he writes, but who writes it.""

Maybe, but it's hard to tell just by looking at Pre-Paid's financial
statements just how good the company really is at collecting
commissions on canceled policies from its own agents. It claims it has
a less-than-5% default rate, but short-sellers believe the risk is much
higher as membership growth falls -- especially if the economy slows.

How much is currently at risk? Hard to say. The company merely breaks
the commission advances shown on its balance sheet into two categories:
current and long-term. Current reflects the first of three years' worth
of commission advances. Long term is the balance. If collections were
never a problem, one short-seller argues, the long-term advance should
never be more than twice the amount of the short-term. Pre-Paid's
long-term commission advances, however, are more like 2.6 times the
short-term.

Still, some analysts argue that Pre-Paid, at 13 times this year's
expected earnings of $2.32 per share, is cheap. That depends, of
course, on which earnings you're looking at. If Pre-Paid were
ultraconservative, some short-sellers argue, it would immediately take
a hit against earnings on all commissions, as they've paid them out
rather than amortizing them over three years as fees are collected. If
they were expensed when they were paid, earnings for the nine months
would've been 58% lighter, or roughly 72 cents a share. And instead of
trading at 13.5 times this year's expected earnings, it would trade at
more like 32 times -- arguably high, the short-sellers say, considering
the risk.

And from the red flag file: Any time a company touts the price of its
stock, to the point of using its stock to legitimize its ""story,"" be on
guard. I've written about one of Stonecipher's previous attempts to
tout his stock before. Well, on Oct. 31, in response to a New York
Stock Exchange inquiry into increased activity in its stock, Pre-Paid
issued a press release.

Instead of merely saying that it doesn't know why its stock has been
active, as most companies do, Pre-Paid touts that its market cap had
passed the ""financial milestone"" of $1 billion, and that its policies
are now in 1 million households. ""We've been referred to as 'one of the
best kept secrets in America,' "" Stonecipher was quoted as saying. ""And
I believe these two announcements indicate that we're reaching a point
of familiarity and acceptance in the market."" Since then, the market
cap has fallen back to $686 million. So much for milestones.

(Note: After two interviews in recent weeks, the company has apparently
stopped returning my calls.)

I have had the following responses on the issues we discussed earlier:

I spoke with David Minns re the 'Eligible Persons' criteria, and he noted 
that while he had discussed the capital/asset holding criteria with Tana, he 
had not provided to anyone the other criteria, and that while these may be 
covered by the US criteria, there will need to be a review of all criteria 
before we can assess that all are covered. 
I spoke with Chris Catt at Price Waterhouse Coopers and he confirmed that 
provided there is no interest component in the cross border settlements made, 
there will be no with-holding tax issues re the payments/receipts. I am going 
to meet with Chris on Monday to discuss both the taxation implications and to 
review the GTC.

On the settlement issue, in the short term the best way to do the settlements 
for non-NEMMCO members would be via wires from Houston (this is how we 
settled our one previous cross border transaction) as this gives a third 
party review of the payments prior to release.

Mark Taylor asked that I take a quick look at the above-referenced 
agreement.  Here are my comments:

1.  Recital B -  We should delete ""Internet access and"".  

2. Definition of Agreement - I am not aware of the term ""annexures"" - I 
assume it is the equivalent of ""annexes"".

3. Section 2.4.1  Should we specify the size and location of the Enron 
Link?   and the Sports.com link?

4. Section 4.2  ""Enron"" should be deleted before the phrase  ""in the event"".

5. Section 8.1 The word ""form"" should be changed to ""from"".

6. Section 8.2.2 The phrase ""will be made available"" should be deleted.

7.  I do not know the creditworthiness of Sports.com, but should we require 
that they maintain general liability insurance to back up the indemnities 
which they are providing us.

joint & several issue should be a problem; there is not a lot of liability 
under the ETA (mostly disclaimers and Enron exculpatory clauses) so the key 
issue is making sure we can hold the right entity liable for transactions.  
That shouldn't be a problem under the side letter, which could make the point 
clear.  The only other issue I can think of is making sure that the necessary 
reps re physical trading (trade option, capacity, energy-related issues) are 
obtained from the right entity, but presumably this can also be covered under
