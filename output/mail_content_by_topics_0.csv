HOW TO PICK AN ALL-IN-ONE: IT'S THE FORM FACTOR, STUPID

    I'll say it straight up: There's no perfect
         device (yet) that combines a cellular phone
         and a PDA. So finding one you can live with is
         always a trade-off. My advice? Choose form
         factor first and live with the compromises.
         (Or just stick with separate gadgets.)

   A recent review of government computing showed

from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000

(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA

You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls
(or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete
this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we
found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our
users back on-line.

We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked
your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This
process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100
IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and
confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying
data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of
you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than
once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want
displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or
phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right
away.

To our IBS Billpayer clients:

During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill
payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring
payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our
highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the
process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this
information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the
months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence
(and support).

Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and
ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be
one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account
information, please refer to the following information:

1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was
the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed
to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or
contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is
the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple 
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.  

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, 
maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagan 
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to 
keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the 
left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.  That 
might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch 
would 
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead and 
have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned my 
alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed 
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan 
allowed.

I left a message about this last week, but wanted to follow-up with
additional information for your review.  We have three offerings currently
available (or coming soon) that I feel would compliment the small/mid cap
and fixed income exposure you already have through Redwood, Sequoia, and
Willow.

Quantitative Allocation, LLC: Integrates four quantitative investment models
to drive aggressive (and potentially leveraged) asset allocation decisions.
Generates exposure to stock and bond markets through indexing techniques and
futures transactions.  Portfolio market exposures can range from +325% to
-175% of net assets.  This is clearly different from the largely
non-leveraged stock-picker funds you already own.  I would consider this to
be a predominately large-cap investment (I think of it as an index fund with
a brain and on steroids - call me and I'll explain that comment in more
detail).

Juniper Crossover Fund, LLC: Managed by OrbiMed Advisors, and focused on
global biotech and pharma.  Up to 30% participation in private equity.  This
could be a way to get you some private equity exposure with a world-class
manager.

Tamarack International Fund, LLC: Long/short stock-picker fund focused on
the international mid-cap market.  I feel this fund is very similar in style
to the managers you already own, but would give you exposure to the
international markets that you currently lack.  This is a new fund and the
first closing will probably be in June.

Of course, the summaries above are for information purposes only and do not
constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy interests in
these funds.  Please call me if you're interested in any of the strategies
outlined above, and I'll have the appropriate offering memorandum sent to
you.

29,"Following are the working transactions in the Central Region/Gas that include 
utility/producer outsourcing:

3rd Quarter

Peoples Energy Production Company
PEPC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Peoples Energy/Chicago.   Transaction 
consists of back-office, risk management and production management for their 
Production company.  Currently performing due diligence and will be making 
proposal (in conjunction with Jean Mrha's group).  Total volume of 30,000 
MMbtu/d oil/gas equivalent for 3 years.   50% probability for closure.

4th Quarter

MGU-Michigan Gas Utilities
MGU is wholly owned subsidiary of Utilicorp.  Transaction is a complete 
outsourcing for the utility (28 BCF/year) for a term of 3 years beginning 
October 2001.  MGU will choose a singular counter-party to proceed to 
structure/negotiations in the next few weeks.  We have received very positive 
feedback from MGU and place our success rate at > 50%.  Original transaction 
priced as Michigan Index trade, but effort was to determine their choice 
counterparty.  Initial indications are that the final structure will consist 
of a basket of index Daily/FOM and fixed price.  Russell Murrell and I have 
been working closely with the decision makers at MGU to ensure success.

SEMCO (Project Pluto)
Utility based in Port Huron, Michigan with sales load of approximately 37 
BCF/year.  Portfolio currently outsourced to TransCanada (4/1/1999-3/31/2002) 
and has been extremely beneficial to SEMCO.  TransCanada (See Gas Daily 
4/30/01) currently holds all fixed priced risk for load following and 
management at around $3.60 and SEMCO was the only Michigan utility who 
effectively managed the arrangements the Michigan utilities negotiated with 
their commission.  Bids are due in August and a counterparty will be chosen 
3rd/4th quarter 2001 for a 3 year transaction commencing 4/1/2002.   Visited 
their office with Sylvia Pollan on 4/11 and our risk is removing the 
incumbent, TransCanada.   SEMCO will be proposing a fixed price structure to 
Michigan commission.

On MGU and SEMCO, the Michigan commission will play a significant role in 
dictating final structures.  If Enron is not successful, these utilities will 
be managed by other 3rd parties and we will keep you abreast of structure 
outcomes.

51,"Dear Mr.. Lavorato,

The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our
account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to
have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds
are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange/ ACCT # 12307915.

Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank.

2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the
beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new
instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient.

For any further questions, please call the accounts department at WSEX.

Thanks for letting me use the phone.  A real life-saver.

My brother had a Nokia world phone on the trip and it seemed to work

On a different topic...Greg talked me into upgrading to first class for a 
flight in December to Australia.  He talked me into it by agreeing to pay for 
half.   Cliff found it funny and agreed to pay for the other half.  I haven't 
expensed it yet so I'm having Barbara send it on.

Hope your interview goes well.  Things are going crazy in the gas market so, 
unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.  

As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.  
Be confident.  Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don't 
know but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find Enron 
appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.  

The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the 
trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask 
any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would 
probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the 
training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement 
though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure 
trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of 
other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall 
under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the 
head of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.

Write me about how your interviews went.
Good luck:
John

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Trent Green , QB STL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/22/00 
 Green will get one more week as the team's starter.  He will start this 
Sunday vs. New Orleans, but Kurt Warner  is expected to return for the 
December 3rd game at Carolina.  This won't be the last you've heard from 
Green.  There has been talk that he will take his services elsewhere next 
year in hopes of obtaining a starting job.  For now look for Green to put up 
big numbers against the Saints defense this week.  New Orleans has a strong 
pass rush but their corners won't be able to contain the Rams' receivers long 
enough for them to pressure Green.    

 Lions , DT DET - FDIC Updated 11/22/00 
 Detroit had one of the top pass rushes in the NFL last year but are 
currently among the worst garnering a mere 22 sacks.   The Lions could be 
primed for a turnaround in the final games of the season.  Detroit's pass 
rush has been much improved since the resignation of head coach Bobby Ross.  
Robert Porcher has played especially well in the last two games tallying five 
sacks and forcing a fumble.  Look for them to have a field day against the 
Patriots Sunday.  New England has allowed an astonishing 38 sacks this 
season.     

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 An MRI on Bates knee showed no structural damage and he is expected to play 
against the Patriots Thursday.  Bates has been a reliable third-down back for 
the Lions but hasn't provided much help for Fantasy teams this season.  Don't 
expect that to change when he faces the Patriots Thursday.     

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/22/00 
 Stewart was able to practice Tuesday and will play in Thursday's game 
against the Patriots.  He suffered a hip-pointer injury Sunday that forced 
him to miss Monday's practice.  Don't be surprised if Stewart struggles 
against the Patriots.  If he isn't full strength he may have a hard time 
avoiding New England's linebackers.   

 Marlon Barnes , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Barnes gained 11 yards on three carries against the Buccaneers Sunday.  
Starter James Allen will be back in the lineup once again this week after 
cutting his hand in last Sunday's game.  Barnes will resume his role as a 
third-down back.  He has played sparingly this season but could have a larger 
role in the offense next year.      

 Eddie Kennison , WR CHI - Murder Inc. Updated 11/22/00 
 Kennison has been a major disappointment as the Bears' second receiver this 
season catching just one touchdown pass through 11 games.  Things won't get 
any better this week when he faces a stingy Jets pass defense.  New York has 
only given up 11 passing TDs all season.  Kennison may get a few catches this 
week but don't expect him to score for your team.  At this point it would be 
wise to bench him if you haven't already.     

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Edinger has been on a roll lately making nine of his last ten field goals.  
He could have another big week against the Jets this week.  The Bears 
shouldn't have any problems moving the chains -the Jets have given up a lot 
of yards this season but have managed to keep the opposition out of the end 
zone.  New York's defense has also seen opposing offenses attempt an 
NFL-leading 28 field goals.  If Edinger can remain accurate in the swirling 
New Jersey winds, he will have a big game.     

 Bears , DT CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Look for the Bears secondary to contribute a few interceptions for your 
Fantasy team this week as Chicago faces the Jets and QB Vinny Testaverde this 
week.  Testaverde has thrown two or more interceptions in his last five 
games.  But if the Bears don't put any pressure on Testaverde and Curtis 
Martin they will rip the defense apart.  Chicago has a weak pass rush and an 
even softer run defense.    

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Hearst has been added to the 49ers' active  roster.  Head coach Steve 
Mariucci says he probably won't get into a game this season, so it wouldn't 
be wise to pick Hearst up as a free agent.  He had spent the entire year on 
the physically-unable-to-perform list after missing all of last season while 
recovering from a career-threatening ankle injury.  Keep an eye on Hearst 
though.  If his condition continues to progress he could be a sleeper pick 
next year.    

 Tony Horne , WR STL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Horne, one of the league's best kick returners, will be out for four to six 
weeks after breaking a bone in his right foot during Monday night's game 
against Washington. He had a 24.2-yard average on kickoff returns, including 
a 103-yard touchdown. The Rams may use Az-Zahir Hakim, their punt returner, 
on kickoffs, but are more likely to sign someone.  

 Charles Kirby , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Mike Alstott now out for at least the remainder of the regular season, 
Kirby is the only remaining true fullback on the Buccaneers' roster. Still, 
he was promoted from the practice squad just two weeks ago merely to serve as 
a blocker in short-yardage situations, so don't expect him to come close to 
the 12 carries per game Alstott was averaging. Warrick Dunn will be the 
primary focus of the running game.  

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 Faulk made an impressive return from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee 
last night against Washington, making nine catches for 88 yards and a 
touchdown while rushing for 33 yards on nine carries. He had the surgery just 
14 days prior, so the Rams were light on his rushing load, but Faulk looked 
solid in his first game back. Expect him to be close to full strength when 
the Rams play New Orleans on Sunday.  

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Steelers have activated Blackwell from the physically unable to perform 
list and placed him on their 53-man roster. He was placed on that list July 
16 after suffering a May knee injury, and is an unrestricted free agent after 
the season. Still, don't count on much, if any, Fantasy value from Blackwell. 
 

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Lions are awaiting results of an MRI performed on Bates' injured knee, 
which he sustained during Sunday's game against the Giants. He is less likely 
to play Thursday against New England than first-stringer James Stewart.  

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/21/00 
 Stewart was unable to practice with the team yesterday after suffering a hip 
pointer in Sunday's game against the Giants. With the Lions' next game coming 
Thursday against New England, there isn't much time for him to heal. Coach 
Gary Moeller thinks Stewart will be able to play through the injury. His 
status is more critical with backup Mario Bates also ailing. If neither can 
go, fullback Cory Schlesinger, running back Sedrick Irvin and special teams 
member Brock Olivo would fill in.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Despite a sprained left knee that required a brace and had him limping 
yesterday, Mitchell is still hopeful he can play Sunday against Pittsburgh. 
He is listed on the injury report as doubtful after suffering a sprained MCL 
during last Sunday's game against New England, but an MRI performed yesterday 
revealed no damage. If Mitchell can play, he will get the start. He'll very 
likely play if it's physically possible.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Allen will not miss practice this week 
after suffering a cut on his right hand during Sunday's game against Tampa 
Bay. He should be ready to play next Sunday against the Jets.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Shane Matthews performing well as the starter, the Bears can afford to 
be patient with McNown as he recovers from a separated left shoulder. He 
threw 15-yard passes with Matthews before Sunday's game against Tampa Bay and 
will participate in some drills tomorrow. McNown could serve as the third 
quarterback next Sunday against the Jets.   

 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/21/00 
 Chandler might lose some playing time over the season's final weeks, as the 
Falcons try to evaluate rookie Doug Johnson for their future. This isn't a 
condemnation of the veteran Chandler, but his owners should make sure he's 
going to start each week before giving him the nod.  

 Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Falcons might consider giving Johnson some playing time over the 
season's final weeks, as the team decides whether he can serve as the QB of 
the future or if one will need to be taken in next year's draft. If he is 
given a shot, those in keeper leagues should keep a close eye on his 
performance.  

 Obafemi Ayanbadejo , RB BAL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Ayanbadejo will likely be inactive for Sunday's game against Cleveland. With 
Baltimore's bye week coming up after that, he will get an extra week to rest, 
and should be ready to roll against San Diego in Week 15.  

 Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Meximullets Updated 11/21/00 
 The Eagles' signal caller is really maturing right before our eyes.  He 
completed 25-of-34 passes for 217 yards and accounted for two touchdowns in 
Sunday's win over Arizona.  He will need to keep his composure next week 
against the Redskins, as the two teams battle for first place in the NFC 
East.  The Eagles will need a huge performance from McNabb if they are to 
beat Washington, so give him a start this week in the big game.    

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 Connell caught five passes for 96 yards in Monday night's win over the 
Rams.  Washington will face a tough Eagles' secondary next week, which will 
be looking to keep their team in first place in the NFC East.  If the 'Skins 
can establish their running game early, Connell could have a big game.      

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/21/00 
 George was very impressive in Monday night's big win over St. Louis.  He 
completed 24-of-34 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns against the 
Rams, further clouding the quarterback situation in Washington.  Starter Brad 
Johnson should know by Thursday if he is able to play next week against the  
Eagles, so keep tabs on his progress in the coming days if you have either of 
these players on your roster.    

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis accounted for 106 yards of total offense but didn't score a touchdown 
as Washington defeated St. Louis 33-20 on Monday night. It was the first time 
in seven weeks that Davis had been held out of the end zone. Look for the 
'Skins to establish Davis early in the game next week against the Eagles in 
an effort to open up their passing game.     

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  ""We'll see Wednesday or Thursday,"" said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, ""but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play.""    

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.

SUPER $198 RT SALE COAST-TO-COAST BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES
This past week, we watched business travelers get hit with their sixth
fare hike of the year. Some routes of over 1,500 miles have increased by
as much as $370 roundtrip since January 1, 2000. Fight back with our
leisure fares from select U.S. cities that let you fly coast to coast for
as little as $198 roundtrip through March 30, 2001 (travel to Florida

Orlando or San Diego to Baltimore. You have many options for travel

THERE=01,S STILL TIME TO FLY ON TURKEY DAY FROM $59 RT
The trick to getting a great fare for those last minute home for the
holiday flights is to travel on Thursday and return on Friday. These
specials are valid for travel throughout both days, but availability is
best for travel later in the day on Thanksgiving, and return travel early
in the day on Friday. You can enjoy a late meal with your family, pack up
some leftovers and be home in time to rest up over the weekend. These

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Aikman left Sunday's game against the Redskins with yet another concussion.  
He looked dazed on the sidelines and is reportedly still suffering from 
dizziness and other symptoms caused by concussions. With only two games 
remaining in the season, don't be surprised if Aikman has seen his last snap 
of the year - and maybe his career. Fantasy owners need to look elsewhere 
than Dallas to find a quarterback worthy of starting during their playoffs.   

 Ray Lucas , QB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Lucas replaced an injured Vinny Tesatverde (groin) in the third quarter of 
Sunday's game at Oakland. Chad Pennington also saw action at QB in the game's 
final quarter.  

 Torry Holt , WR STL - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 On nine catches, Holt racked up 172 yards. With Kurt Warner returning to 
form, Holt should be able to maintain a high level of play during the final 
rounds of the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Though he completed just 12 of 28 passes, Brooks passed for 203 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions, and also ran 11 times for 108 yards. 
Brooks has suddenly emerged as a surprising two-way threat just in time for 
the Fantasy playoffs.       

 Jacquez Green , WR TB - Hunter Shively Updated 12/10/00 
 The Tampa Bay wideout failed to record a catch against Miami. After some 
early-season heroics, Green has proved he doesn't deserve to start on any 
Fantasy team during the postseason.      

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 With the Jets trailing 21-0, Testaverde injured his groin and was replaced 
by Ray Lucas in the third quarter of Sunday night's game at Oakland. Lucas 
threw an interception on his first drive and was briefly replaced by Chad 
Pennington on the Jets' next possession before finishing the series.   

 Brett Favre , QB GB - The Klap Updated 12/10/00 
 The Packers' quarterback completed just 15 of 36 passes for 208 yards with 
one touchdown, one interception and a lost fumble. If you advance to the next 
round, you may want to sit Favre, who has run hot and cold during Green Bay's 
recent resurgence.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - Eric Bass Updated 12/10/00 
 Topping 1,000 yards for the season, Allen ran for 97 yards and a touchdown 
on 37 carries. He also caught a TD pass. Allen played well against the lowly 
Patriots, but you still might not be able to consistently depend on him as a 
Fantasy starter during the postseason.    

 Darnell Autry , RB PHI - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/10/00 
 Despite scoring the Eagles' initial touchdown, Autry ran for just 28 yards 
on 10 carries. Newly-signed Chris Warren did not play, but Autry certainly 
feels Warren's shadow looming over him and might see his playing time 
seriously slip in the final two games.  

 Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/10/00 
 The rookie back picked up just 20 yards on 11 carries. Don't trust him 
during these important final weeks. Dayne has been much too inconsistent this 
season.  

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 150 yards and a touchdown. Smith looked like he 
was in his prime, evading tacklers, pushing them over and exploding away from 
them. He still has the tools to be an integral part of a Fantasy title team.  

 Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/10/00 
 On 11 carries, Pittman ran for minus one yard. If Jake Plummer continues to 
battle injuries, opponents will tee off on Pittman. Thomas Jones also looked 
good in garbage time and very well could see more playing time in the final 
two games.  

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 On six catches, Dawkins finished with 85 yards and a pair of touchdowns. As 
expected, he took advantage of the awful Denver secondary but he is still not 
a reliable starter during the Fantasy playoffs.   

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/10/00 
 While running for 89 yards on 17 carries, Richardson added eight catches for 
56 yards. He should keep the starting halfback job in Kansas City for the 
season's final two games.   

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 Reaching the end zone on the ground and through the air, George ran 24 times 
for 81 yards and a touchdown, while catching four passes for 20 yards and two 
more scores. George will definitely be the MVP of many Fantasy championship 
teams this year.   

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 The Jaguars' wideout caught eight passes for 147 yards and a touchdown. He 
appears to be rasing his level of play just in time for the final rounds of 
the Fantasy playoffs.      

 Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/10/00 
 Kaufman left Sunday's game against the Jets in the second quarter after 
injuring his right knee. He was taken to the locker room for further 
examnination.  

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 On seven catches, Patten racked up 103 yards and a touchdown. Patten has 
showed signs of promise this year, but has lacked consistency when 
healthy.      

 Shannon Sharpe , TE BAL - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 The veteran tight end caught just one pass for seven yards. Trent Dilfer 
appears to be speading the ball among many WRs, and Sharpe has suddenly 
become a non-factor in the Baltimore offense.   

 Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - FIBSABs Updated 12/10/00 
 In a valiant effort, Bledsoe completed 26 of 45 passes for 225 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions. The veteran QB might continue to perform 
well in New England's final two games.   

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 79 yards and the Dolphins' lone touchdown. 
Despite facing the Tampa Bay run defense, Smith did not let his owners down 
at a crucial time of year.   

 Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/10/00 
 On 18 carries, Dillon picked up only 42 yards. The Cincinnati RB still has a 
tendency to disappear against the league's better defenses.  

 Ryan Wetnight , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Wetnight suffered a concussion in Sunday's win over Detroit.  

 Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Hatchette left Sunday's game in the second half after pulling a muscle on 
his side.  Troy Walters replaced Hatchette as the third wideout.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Aikman left Sunday's game in the first half with a concussion. He was 
replaced by Anthony Wright. Randall Cunningham is the team's emergency QB 
this week because of his recent groin problems.  

 Anthony Wright , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Wright replaced an injured Troy Aikman early in the second quarter of 
Sunday's game against Washington.  

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 12/10/00 
 Fiedler suffered an injured left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 
Buccaneers.  The injury seemed to affect his accuracy as he threw four 
interceptions in the game.  Keep an eye on his situation.  The injury may 
warrant you dropping him from your Fantasy lineup next week.       

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 McNair was lifted in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. 
Jeff Fisher replaced him with Neil O'Donnell, deciding McNair needed a 
well-deserved rest to keep him healthy after throwing three TD passes.  

 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 12/10/00 
 Taylor left Sunday's game against Jacksonville in the third quarter with the 
Jaguars leading 30-3. He seemed to suffer a minor injury to his knee that had 
been bothering him earlier in the year, but he remained on the sidelines and 
appeared to be in good condition.   

 Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Greisen replaced an ineffective Dave Brown in the third quarter of Sunday's 
game at Jacksonville.

XCEL SEEKS $20B UTILITY MERGER; LOOKS TO BUY BACK NRG 

Xcel Energy, one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., is courting FirstEnergy, TXU and Entergy as potential merger partners and at the same time is looking to repurchase the remaining 20% stake of its unregulated IPP affiliate, NRG Energy, which it partially spun off in May 2000. 

U.K. UTILITY PUTS WIND BIZ ON THE BLOCK

U.K. utility Innogy has put its U.S. wind farm business up for sale and hired J.P. Morgan to find a buyer. The portfolio, which consists of two 20 MW farms in California and a further 600 MW of projects in construction or under development in California, Texas and Pennsylvania, could fetch Innogy some $300 million.

PROS Revenue Management Announces Record Third Quarter and YTD 2001

November 20, 2001-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in revenue management science and the pioneer and dominant provider of revenue management to the airline and energy industries, today announced that third quarter, although impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001, was a record revenue quarter for the company, and the company achieved low double digit operating income levels.  PROS posted revenue in the first nine months of the year of $27.7 million, which is a 36% increase over the previous year.  Record profits, along with positive cash flow, enhanced PROS' strong balance sheet.  PROS also posted record annual revenues and profits for 2000.  

""Our goal is to be the clear leader in the new Revenue Pricing Optimization category,"" says Bert Winemiller, president and CEO of PROS.  ""Our financial performance of record revenues, profits, and cash flow will enable PROS to maintain its commitment to achieving this goal and provide high value solutions to our clients.""

o In the airline industry, PROS completed signed contracts with airline companies, including Aeropostal, Air Jamaica, All Nippon Airways, Cathay    Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Korean Air, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, and TWA/American Airlines. 
o Contracts were signed in the energy industry with major US gas pipeline companies.
o PROS concluded its second contract for Network Optimization (O&D) in the airline industry.  This product will become the standard for the       industry.  
o Energy Pricing & Revenue Optimization Seminars were held with participation from industry leaders and Accenture.
o PROS hosted its first Pricing Optimization Web Seminar which covered pricing optimization principles common among virtually all industries.       Participants included executives of some of the strongest Fortune 500 companies.
o PROS completed the move of its headquarters to the ComTech Center in midtown Houston.  This state-of-the-art facility will assist in the       support of PROS' expansion both internally and into other industries.
o PROS announced its 9th Annual Pricing and Revenue Optimization Conference, the largest revenue management conference in the world, with     industry leaders, analysts and representatives from industries such as airline, energy, healthcare, hospitality, broadcast, rental car, and rail.  The    Conference will take place March 3-7, 2002.

To: Cave mates
From: Osama
Re: The Cave

Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours but we've really come  
together  as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for putting up the 
poster  that says, ""There is no I in team"" as well as the  one that says 
""Hang In There, Baby."" That cat is hilarious. However, while  we are 
fighting a  jihad, we can't  forget to take care of the cave. And frankly I 
have a few concerns.

First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we  
should be even  more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey,  you 
don't want to be  stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave  
daily. I've posted a  sign  up sheet near the main cave opening.

Second, it's not often I make a video address but  when I do, I'm trying to  
scare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That  means that while we're 
taping, please do not ride your razor scooters in  the background. Just  
while we're taping. Thanks.

Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know,  by edict, we're not  
supposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene,  
especially after mealtime. We're all in this  together.

Fourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently,  clearly wrote ""Osama""  
on  the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my  Cheez-Its were gone.  
Consideration. That's all I'm saying.

Finally, we've heard that there may be American  soldiers in disguise trying 
  to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to  look for them. First 
  patrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and  Richard.

Love you lots.
Osama

Keeping with the ""you know what I know"" philosophy here.

Still checking on confirmations but wanted to pass this along to you from
one of our subscribers, Greg Divers.

Greg just sent me this email:

""WSCR 1160AM in Chicago just reported that Bears' WR Marcus Robinson is done
for the year because of a bulging disk in his back.""

Thanks Greg.  While this is bad news for those hoping for a Robinson
comeback, at least it gives you a jump in the week for planning how to fill
the void.  More tonight as I hear it.

              A MESSAGE FROM DONALD L. EVANS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Friend,

The election results in Florida have been certified in accordance
with Florida state law and the rulings of the Florida Supreme
Court, and Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney have won that
state's 25 electoral votes.  It is now time to get on with the
business of organizing a new administration.

In order to begin that task, we have filed articles of
incorporation for the Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition
Foundation, a non-profit corporation.  As past transition
foundations have done, we have applied for 501(c)(4) status from
the Internal Revenue Service.  Now we are asking for your help as
our team moves forward with plans for an orderly transition
process in the short period between now and inauguration day,
January 20, 2001.

While the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, as amended in
1988, specifically authorizes public funds for transitions, it
also makes provisions for raising contributions from private
sources to help defray transition-related expenses.  This has
been done previously, most recently in 1992.  We are now
soliciting contributions from our most active supporters.  Would
you please visit our new transition website at
http://www.bushcheneytransition.com and make a contribution on our
secure server?  AOL link: <a href=http://www.bushcheneytransition.com/>Bush + 
Cheney Transition</a>

We have made the decision to accept contributions only from
individuals.  No corporate or political action committee
contributions will be accepted.  Contributions may not exceed
$5,000 per person or $10,000 per couple, and all contributors, in
compliance with Governor Bush's position of full-disclosure of
financial contributions, will be posted on the transition website
on a real-time basis.  These contributions will not count against
an individual's annual political contribution federal giving
limit of $25,000

The American voters have spoken, and we are moving forward to
establish a government that will unify our country and make the
common principles we share as Americans our first priority.

If you have questions, please contact the Transition Foundation's
finance office at 512-344-3722.  All other transition inquiries
should be directed to our office in McLean, VA at (703) 918-2900.
Your support of the Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition
Foundation is deeply appreciated.

Sincerely,

Donald L. Evans
Board of Directors

			Mock draft No. 1: Mihm's the word
			
?			
			
			
			
			
			
?	By Andy Katz
	ESPN.com
	
	With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere 
between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential 
of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.
	
	NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking 
heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft 
camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of 
talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several 
projections we'll have on ESPN.com.
	
	A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but 
could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing 
in Chicago.
	
	The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a 
chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center 
Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason 
Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard 
Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point 
guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State 
junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey 
forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.
	
	Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next 
month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must 
decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until 
June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and 
Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what 
happens.
	
	ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock 
draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.
	
	
	
	
	Chris Mihm
	
	Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.
	
	1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and 
could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets 
could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next 
season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.
	
	2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be 
getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player 
in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer. 
Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the 
Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.
	
	3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have 
already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward 
(which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him 
defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to 
return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door 
open for a return.
	
	4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center 
for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next 
in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better 
offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.
	
	5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles 
but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic 
an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last 
season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.
	
	6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on 
Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better 
scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta 
wants a small forward over a big guard.
	
	7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can 
package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be 
solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy 
McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would 
have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.
	
	8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the 
third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too, 
but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for 
size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are 
split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.
	
	9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go 
higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce 
during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson, 
DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over 
a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.
	
	10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.): 
The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their 
three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has 
scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without 
feeling pressured to play him next season.
	
	11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past 
11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but 
can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from 
Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much 
different.
	
	12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don 
Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the 
Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a 
foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts 
and in Chicago -- if he shows.
	
	13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to 
take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough 
to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the 
point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching 
because of his leadership and toughness.
	
	14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't 
let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next 
to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go 
higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.
	
	15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power 
forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift. 
None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a 
rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the 
Pacers.
	
	16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a 
backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under 
any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind 
Cleaves. 
	
	17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed, 
he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit 
all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the 
Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement 
Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs. 
	
	18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers 
need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that 
some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of 
being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.
	
	19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up 
into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will 
catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of 
his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The 
Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.
	
	20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have 
already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off 
the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first 
round, regardless of where he's being picked.
	
	21. Toronto -- Craig ""Speedy"" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have 
already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If 
Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural 
pick for the Raptors.
	
	22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some 
heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical 
players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big. 
Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.
	
	23. Utah -- Hanno M""tt""l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with 
picking M""tt""l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end 
up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small 
forward. If M""tt""l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first 
round.
	
	24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point 
guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most 
intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard 
positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the 
Bulls some versatility on the floor.
	
	25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another 
big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor 
together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns 
have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.
	
	26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism 
and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason. 
Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could 
still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.
	
	27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave 
reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early 
without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers 
have a history of going younger in the draft.
	
	28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers 
don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to 
jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking 
skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many 
miles left in his legs.
	
	29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's 
where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or 
Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the 
Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Rex Chapman , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Chapman announced his retirement Monday because of a series of injuries.  He 
underwent surgery on his right wrist before training camp and began the 
season on the injured list.  Chapman is also scheduled to have ankle surgery 
soon.     

 Todd Day , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Day was activated from the injured list Friday.  Guard Sam Jacobsen was 
placed on the list to make room for Day.  Day was a key reserve for the Suns 
in 1999-2000 but was sidelined for the first few weeks this season due to a 
knee injury.  He will be a valuable reserve for the T'Wolves as well but 
won't help a Fantasy team too much.     

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Skinner was placed on the injured list after hurting his ankle.  Zendon 
Hamilton was activated to replace Skinner on the roster.  Skinner has been 
somewhat of a disappointment this season averaging 5.8 points and 4.7 
rebounds per game.     

 Jeff McInnis , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 McInnis is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nets after 
suffering a bruised knee against the Sonics Saturday.  Rookie Keyon Dooling 
is expected to get his first start at point guard for the Clippers.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Williams played 26 minutes in Saturday's game against the Suns, scoring four 
points and grabbing seven rebounds.  He had missed Thursday's game against 
the Hornets because of a hip and groin injuries.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Del Negro played eight minutes in Sunday's loss to the Knicks.  He had 
missed the Warriors previous two games due to a sprained ankle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Buckner re-injured his right foot and is expected to be sidelined for at 
least a week.  Hubert Davis is expected to start at shooting guard in his 
absence.    

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Dickerson is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nuggets due 
to a sprained ankle.  Look for veteran Kevin Edwards to start at shooting 
guard in his place.    

 Doug West , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 West's strained right shoulder has healed and head coach Sidney Lowe is 
expected to activate him from the injured list this week.  Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 
is expected to be placed on the injured list to make room for West.  

 Shareef Abdur-Rahim , F VAN - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/20/00 
 Abdur-Rahim is expected to play in Monday's game against Vancouver.  He 
missed Saturday's game to be with his sick mother in Atlanta.  If he doesn't 
make it back to Vancouver in time rookie Stromile Swift could get a rare 
start at small forward.    

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 MacCulloch was placed on the injured list Monday with an ankle injury.  With 
the return of Matt Geiger, MacCulloch's already low Fantasy value diminishes 
even further.     

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/20/00 
 Geiger has been activated off the injured list, and could see some playing 
time in tonight's game in Boston.  With Geiger's return, the Sixers placed 
center Todd McCulloch on the injured list.  If you have Geiger on your 
Fantasy roster, give him some time to get back into game shape before putting 
him in your starting lineup.    

 Tim Thomas , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Thomas disclosed on Saturday that he is having some real discomfort in his 
left knee, and it is getting worse with each game that he plays. Thomas has 
started off slow, but didn't want to use the injury as an excuse.  ""It's very 
painful at times,"" said Thomas. ""The only thing I can do is keep getting rest 
as much as possible.""  The Bucks can ill-afford to lose Thomas; they have 
already lost starting forward Darvin Ham and backup forward Scott Williams 
this season.  If Thomas is on your Fantasy squad, it might be a good idea to 
keep in on the bench until his condition improves.      

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Jones has missed three straight games with a right calf sprain, but says 
that he expects to play on Wednesday night against Cleveland. Jones has 
averaged 16.9 points through his first seven games in Miami.     

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/20/00 
 Rose his hoping to make his season debut on Tuesday night against the 
Rockets, but he's not making any promises.  He was suppose to return to 
action last week, but the team's medical personnel advised him to wait a bit 
longer before hitting the court.  If Rose is on your roster, give him at 
least another week before putting him into your starting lineup.    

 Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 The Detroit Pistons announced on Monday morning that they had come to terms 
with Smith, on what is believed to be a one-year deal for the NBA's mid-level 
exception of $2.25 million (pro-rated after 11 games).  Smith had reportedly  
agreed to re-sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum 
of $611,000 last week.  He will eventually be the Pistons starting center but 
will probably spend the next few weeks inmproving his conditioning.  There is 
no need to rush and try to acquire Smith.  He has been a solid reserve 
at-best throughout his career.  If you have him on your Fantasy team wait 
awhile before you insert him into your lineup.     

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/20/00 
 Camby turned his ankle during Friday night's victory in Phoenix. X-rays 
taken on his ankle were negative, then Camby underwent an MRI as a 
precautionary measure. He missed Sunday night's game against the Warriors, 
and is listed as day to day.       

 Tim Hardaway , G MIA - The Old School Fools Updated 11/19/00 
 Hardaway, plagued by knee ailments for the past two seasons, sat out 
Saturday night's game against the Portland Trail Blazers with tendinitis in 
his right knee. Hardaway said he expects to play in Miami's next game 
Wednesday against Cleveland.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00 
 O'Neal, bothered by a sprained left ankle and a sore Achilles' tendon, was 
not in uniform Saturday night as the Los Angeles Lakers played the Denver 
Nuggets.  His status is day-to-day.  O'Neal said he was injured when someone 
fell on his leg in the first quarter of Thursday night's overtime victory at 
Sacramento. Greg Foster took O'Neal's place in the starting lineup.     

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00 
 Coleman, who missed the entire preseason because of an irregular heartbeat, 
was placed on the injured list Saturday so he can improve his conditioning.   
The move comes after Charlotte Hornets coach Paul Silas complained about the 
power forward's weight   

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Nesby made his fifth consecutive start at shooting guard for the Clippers 
Thursday.  Although he did not score in the game his defense against 
Vancouver's Michael Dickerson might have solidified him at the two-spot.  The 
switch has worked lately as the Clippers have won two games in a row.  Keep 
an eye on Nesby, if he starts scoring some points he will be a solid Fantasy 
pickup.      

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/17/00 
 McDyess appears to have overcome the back injury that stunted his production 
last week.  He scored 16 points and grabbed 11 rebounds against the Bulls 
Thursday.  McDyess is averaging 22 points and 10.6 boards in his last three 
games.  It is now safe to start McDyess again if you benched him last week.   
 

 Ruben Patterson , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Suffering from the flu, Patterson is questionable for Friday's game against 
the Mavericks.  Patterson recently rejoined the Sonics' starting lineup at 
shooting guard.  If he is unable to play Brent Barry will probably start.    

 Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 The Dallas Morning News reports that Smith has agreed to re-sign with the 
Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum of $611,000.  The deal, 
subject to league approval, could be formally announced later Friday or 
Saturday.  Smith's return to Minnesota will land him in his familiar role as 
a backup at the power forward and center positions.  His situation has 
created a lot of buzz but the truth is he is not much of a Fantasy player 
anyway.  If you already have a solid frontcourt don't try to pursue him.  If 
your Fantasy frontcourt is lacking then try to get him.  He will be a good 
addition to a Fantasy team but won't be a star.     

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Once one of the Spurs best outside shooters, Jackson has played in only one 
game this season, due in part to a lingering ankle injury.  At this point it 
would be wise to get rid of Jackson if you have him on your team and add 
another guard/forward.    

 Chris Webber , F SAC - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/17/00 
 Webber sat out Thursday's game against the Lakers due to a sprained ankle.  
Scott Pollard started at power forward in Webber's place.  Webber is listed 
as day-to-day and is expected to return for the Kings' next game on 
Wednesday.    

 Terrell Brandon , G MIN - Fear Updated 11/17/00 
 Brandon will miss his third straight game Friday when he sits out the 
T'Wolves home game against the Spurs.  Chauncey Billups will continue to 
start in his absence.  It may not be a bad idea to bench Brandon and add 
Billups to your team until he is back to full strength.     

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Williams missed Thursday's game against the Hornets due to a left groin and 
hip strain.  He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.  Shandon Anderson 
moved over to small forward in his absence and Cuttino Mobley moved into the 
starting lineup at shooting guard.  Williams remains one of the premier 
three-point shooters in the NBA connecting on 50 percent of his attempts this 
season.       

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Mills has missed Golden State's last two games because of a sore back.  He 
is questionable for Friday's game at Indiana.  When he does return he may be 
inserted into the starting lineup at small forward. Starting power forward 
Danny Fortson will be sidelined for the next few weeks due to a sore right 
foot.  Mills and Chris Mullin will be called upon to fill the void in the 
frontcourt.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Del Negro missed Wednesday's game due to an ankle injury and is doubtful for 
Friday's contest at Indiana.  Newly-acquired Randy Livingston will be the 
backup point guard in his absence.

Hi Folks,

Doing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your
lineups for the stretch run.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups
this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly
where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive
emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but
listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup
may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start
the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup
one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk,
Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.  (Yes, even after
last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool
in your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.
http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position
numbers are from ESPN.com.   Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy
Hicks.
Let's get to it.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the
Offense.


Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Minnesota Defense

Stacey Mack played well last week rushing for 115 yards on 28 carries (4.1
ypc).   He's settling into the starting RB role pretty well.   Still very
quiet on the Fred Taylor front so you have to assume Mack's going to keep
his job.   With no playoff hopes, it probably makes sense not to rush Taylor
back.   Mack will face an ultra soft Viking defense this week ranked # 31 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Indianapolis Defense

Curtis Martin ran hard last week.   He had 78 yards on 24 carries (3.2 ypc)
plus he caught a couple of passes.   This might be his week though as the
Colts are weak on defense ranking # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.   If he's going to explode, this is the week.


St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Carolina Defense

Start Faulk.   End of story.   He's the best player in Fantasy Football.
If it matters (and it doesn't) the Panthers rank # 24 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.   Faulk's knee was described as ""puffy"" after the game but he insists
he'll be fine and play.   Although some are saying Trung Canidate will see
increased time.   He's still a must start in my opinion though.


Tennessee's Eddie George / Skip Hicks vs Oakland Defense

This one hurts.   Eddie George owners have been circling on their calendars
the Oakland game with their porous rush defense.   And then Skip Hicks comes
in last week and looks like Earl Campbell rushing for 142 yards on 17
carries (8.4 ypc) and a score   (Granted, those numbers are padded with a 51
yard rush)   George is such a team player that he reportedly didn't mind
Hicks staying in the game as he had the hot hand.   I think you'll see
George back this week in his regular role but Hicks could get the call at
any time.   The Raiders have improved on defense.   Now they just rank # 30
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble
stopping the Offense.


Atlanta's Maurice Smith / Bob Christian vs Buffalo Defense

Maurice looked a little better (or healthier) this week but he's still
underperforming.   He rushed 11 times for 49 yards (4.5 ypc) Sunday.   Bob
Christian is clearly going to be more involved at RB.   He had 7 rushes for
17 yards (2.4 ypc) and a score.   Christian also tacked on 66 yards
receiving.   At this point, I'd say Christian deserves a look in larger
leagues.   The Bill Defense is pretty weak ranking # 27 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Washington Defense

With 31 carries last week for 173 yards (5.6 ypc), I think it's safe to say
Thomas is back.   He's a perfect fit for this conservative offense.   Plus
the Bear's defense looks like it'll keep them in most games which keeps
Thomas involved.   He'll face a Redskin defense that ranks # 19 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.


Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Cleveland Defense

It's my opinion that Ahman Green owners should just forget about last week.
Green was held to just 9 yards on 9 carries by a surging Tennessee defense.
I see very little to make me think this wasn't an aberration.   This week,
he'll face a softer Brown defense that's ranked # 14 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, Cleveland is
ranked # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Fantasy Football owners
traditionally have memories that last about 7 days.   I personally am not
letting last weeks performance wipe out what has been a great year.


Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs New York Jets Defense

It's too early to be talking about Edgerrin James being a product of the
""system"" but the truth of the matter is that no name Dominic Rhodes is
tearing it up lately.   He's had 298 rushing yards over the last 3 games.
Sunday, he rolled for 177 of them on 29 carries (6.1 ypc)   (and his longest
run was 35 yards so it's not like he padded the stats with a 80 yarder)   He
caught 3 passes to boot.   Clearly, he's playing at a high level right now
and is a must start in most leagues.   The Jets were horrible early on
against the run but have now improved to average ranking # 17 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New England's Antowain Smith vs Miami Defense

You know Antowain Smith had fun against his old team Sunday when he rolled
up 95 yards on 20 carries (4.8 ypc)   He continues to be one of the better
stories of 2001.   Over the last 3 weeks, he ranks as the # 8 RB in Fantasy
points per game.   Smith should have had a TD but went down at the 2.   This
week, he'll face a Dolphin Defense that's been soft lately.   They rank # 26
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New Orleans' Ricky Williams / Deuce McAllister vs Tampa Bay Defense

Williams had a sub par game Monday night and it does seem like Coach Jim
Haslett has been looking the other way the last few games.   He only had 14
carries Monday.   He did gain 57 yards (4.1 ypc) so he did well when he was
in there.   Some of that can be attributed to the Rams and their offense
taking Williams out.   Although you can't ignore Deuce McAllister.
McAllister had 5 catches for 44 yards (but just one carry)   The Bucs are
nothing special lately ranking # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over
the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed
to RBs.   Keep an eye on Tampa's Warren Sapp who missed a good bit of time
last week with a shoulder injury.   It'd be a nice boost if he's less than
100%.


New York Giants' Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Seattle Defense

Barber continues to steal the show from Ron Dayne.   Barber rushed 16 times
for 85 yards (5.3 ypc)   Dayne only had 4 carries for 9 yards.   Barber was
also the Giant's leading receiver with 5 receptions.   I don't see that
changing a lot.   Seattle is ranked # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.


San Francisco's Garrison Hearst vs Philadelphia Defense

Garrison Hearst continues to be one of the best stories in the league.   He
ran for 103 yards on 26 carries Sunday (4.0 ypc)   You have to be a little
worried about him though as Kevan Barlow got both rushing TDs.   And both
Terry Jackson and Fred Beasley saw red zone carries.   Hearst will be a guy
who runs up and down the field but it looks like coach Steve Mariucci has
more faith in the other guys for the goalline.   The Eagles rank # 23 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Arizona's Michael Pittman / Thomas Jones vs Dallas Defense

Things are looking pretty bad for Michael Pittman owners.   As we commented
earlier, the carries allotted to Jones have been creeping up.   Last week,
it looked more like a full blown time share with Pittman running 14 times
for 37 yards (2.6 ypc) and Jones totaling 24 yards on 12 carries (2.0 ypc)
Clearly, neither are any good but that's bad news for Pittman owners.   Of
even more concern is the fact that Jones is looking like the short yardage /
red zone guy.   The Cowboys rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over
the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed
to RBs.   It's tough right now to put much faith in either guy though, even
with the favorable matchup.


Buffalo's Shawn Bryson vs Atlanta Defense

Travis Henry's tough rookie year continued Sunday as he injured his knee.
Shawn Bryson will likely get the bulk of the work this week.   Bryson didn't
do much Sunday running 14 times for 38 yards (2.7 ypc)   He did catch 3
passes.   He'll likely be better with a week of practice with the first
unit.   The Falcons haven't been anything special against the run lately
ranking # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and #
21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the year.


Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Arizona Defense

Emmitt Smith looked like the ""old"" Emmitt Smith.  ""Old"" as in 2001 version
which means not very good.   He struggled to get 39 yards on 12 carries (3.2
ypc) and generally wasn't a factor.   He's an up and down player so realize
your taking a chance with him.   The Cardinals aren't much on defense
ranking # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Miami's Lamar Smith vs New England Defense

Lamar Smith is a grinder type back that needs lots of carries to be
effective.   He only rushed 9 times Sunday for 22 yards (2.4 ypc)   That
won't get it done.   Travis Minor is a threat but it looks to me like the
Dolphins will stay with Smith for now.   New England ranks # 13 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Pittsburgh's Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala / Jerome Bettis / Amos Zereoue vs
Detroit Defense

Amos Zereoue had a pretty good game against Baltimore with 73 yards on 16
carries (4.6 ypc)   But he hurt his shoulder and is now questionable for
this week's game.   Fuamatu-Ma'afala ran hard but had little room to move
gaining 15 yards on 9 carries (1.7 ypc)   And finally, Jerome Bettis is in
the mix although the early word has him as doubtful again for this week's
game.   Obviously, they're being very careful to preserve him for the
playoffs.   We'll try to stay on this story this week for you.   The Lions
are surprisingly tough against the run lately ranking # 11 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Kansas City Defense

Tomlinson struggled a bit last week with just 46 yards on 17 carries (2.7
ypc)   He did add 23 yards on 6 catches.   He'll face an improved KC defense
this week ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs New York Giants Defense

It's been an up and down last couple of weeks for Alexander owners but with
Ricky Watters broken ankle, Alexander is back in the saddle as the # 1 Guy.
Look for him to pick up where he left off.   Last week, he rushed for 27
yards on 7 carries (3.9 ypc) plus a TD.   The Giants have been pretty
average lately in stopping the run ranking # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


Washington's Stephen Davis vs Chicago Defense

Stephen Davis played well last week with 111 yards on 24 carries (4.6 ypc)
He was one of the few bright spots for Washington.   This week, he faces a
tough but beatable Bear defense that ranks # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble
for the Offense.


Baltimore's Moe Williams / Terry Allen vs Cincinnati Defense

You know it's not good when Obafemi Ayanbadejo leads the team in rushing
yards and Elvis Grbac leads the team in rushing TDs.   But that's what
happened Sunday against the Steelers.  ( I wonder if Ray Lewis thinks the
Steelers have a ""real defense"" yet?)   Moe Williams logged 15 yards on 4
carries (3.8 ypc) and Terry Allen made a less than smashing debut with 3
yards on 3 carries (you do the math)   Tough to say how it'll be split this
week but you'd have to think Allen will see more time.   The Bengals aren't
as good as Pittsburgh, but they're very good ranking # 4 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 4 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Tough matchup especially since it's not yet
clear how the carries will be split.

Cleveland's James Jackson / Jamel White vs Green Bay Defense

Watch this one closely this week as Jackson tweaked his troublesome ankle
again.   He could be ok, but it's not clear early this week.   If he can't
go, I'd expect you'll see Jamel White over Ben Gay as Gay has made more than
his share of mistakes.   Whoever runs will be facing the suddenly vulnerable
Packers who rank # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs San Diego Defense

We had Holmes ranked # 5 last week.  I'm guessing you'll see more sites
follow our lead and raise him up the charts as well.   He had a monster game
(again) with 121 yards on 29 carries (4.2 ypc) plus the score.   He's a must
start against pretty much any defense.   This week, he'll face a San Diego
team ranked # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Still
though, I wouldn't let that stop me.   Do keep an eye on his health this
week as he's nursing a sore groin that might limit him.


Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Jacksonville Defense

Outside of Indianapolis, I don't know that there's been a more disappointing
than Minnesota.   Or one tougher to predict each week.   You get fired up on
Michael Bennett and then he cools off.   Last week, he was back to his early
season workload with only 10 carries.   He did gain 40 yards (4.0 ypc) so
when he ran, he did fine.   With him, it's a numbers game.   Give him enough
carries and eventually he'll break one.   But 10 opportunities won't do it.
And he'll face a very tough Jacksonville defense that's been hot lately.
They rank # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Oakland's Charlie Garner vs Tennessee Defense

Charlie Garner had his usual productive day with 68 yards rushing on 19
carries (3.6 ypc) plus another 45 yards receiving.   The big news was Tyrone
Wheatley not getting a carry.   Looks like Zack Crockett is back in at the
goalline.   Although that can change at any moment.   The Titans shut down
Ahman Green last week so that's a worry.   They rank # 9 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs San Francisco Defense

Staley continues to salvage his rushing numbers with his contributions in
the passing game.   He rushed 15 times for 36 yards Sunday (2.4 ypc)   He
also had 2 fumbles.   But on the bright side, he caught 8 passes for 73
yards.   They'll find the going a little tougher this week against San
Francisco ranked # 5 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs New Orleans Defense

You'll go crazy trying to figure out which one of these guys will do
anything week to week.   Dunn only had 10 carries for 27 yards (2.7 ypc) and
Alstott only managed 7 rushes for 23 yards (3.3 ypc)   Dunn was heavily
involved in the Tampa Dink and Dunk passing game but that's tough to count
on.   They'll face a New Orleans defense that's likely smarting from the
Rams defeat.   They rank # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major
problems for the Offense.


Carolina's Richard Huntley vs St. Louis Defense

Huntley should be rested after the bye week.   Unfortunately, rest won't
make him any more talented.   The Rams rank # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed
per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so
this isn't looking good.


Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Baltimore Defense

It's strength against strength this week with Dillon facing the Ravens.   If
you can imagine it, the Bengals will be hurting without Akili Smith at QB...
That means Dillon is the whole offense and you can bet the Ravens will be
geared up for it.   On a forward looking note, it doesn't get any easier for
Dillon as he has Tennessee and Pittsburgh on the horizon.   If your trade
deadline hasn't passed, I'd consider dealing him.   The Ravens rank # 12 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks but I think they're
better than that.   They rank # 3 for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.


Detroit's James Stewart vs Pittsburgh Defense

James Stewart's hip injury may not be as bad as feared.   He had a solid
game in their first victory last week rushing for 91 yards on 20 carries
(4.6 ypc)   The awful news this week is that he's playing Pittsburgh.   The
Steelers are dominating offenses right now ranking # 1 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

******************************************************

Quarterbacks in the News:

Rob Johnson (Buf) is out this week with a bruised shoulder and ego.  
Alex Van Pelt will again start in his place.

Scott Mitchell (Cin) is doubtful this week.  He is not expected to 
play.  Jon Kitna will start as usual.

Mike McMahon (Det) is still wearing the protective boot and has not 
practiced all week.  He is unlikely to play.  Ty Detmer will start if 
McMahon cannot go. McMahon appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore foot.

Mark Brunell (Jac) practiced on Wednesday and Thursday and is 
expected to start on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as

Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman.

Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1704&key=1152&""><B>Jerome Bettis</B></A>, RB PIT - Who's Yo Daddy <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>

213,"Ok then.

",,,
214,"Hi Folks,

Again this week our own Cheatsheets.net Meteorologist, Mike McVay from
WOWK - TV offers his expert insights on the weather conditions that may
affect your players this week.  It's early but here are some potential
situations to keep an eye on.

",Mike McVay,,Cheatsheets.net
215,"Dear Eric,

We scored a major victory for election integrity this past
Sunday when Florida certified the election results in George
W. Bush's favor.  I want to thank you for being one of the
325,000 plus Americans who joined the petition campaign at
ElectionIntegrity2000.com to ""Certify the Bush
Victory.""

Unfortunately, Al Gore has flatly refused to accept the fair
and just election results.  Instead, he is pursuing a
calculated course of action intended to overturn the will of
the voters and the CERTIFIED election results.  Included in
these actions are his attempts to attack and discredit
military absentee votes cast for George W. Bush while
simultaneously using manipulative ""hand-counting"" techniques
to convert so-called ""dimpled chads"" into votes for Gore.

This is not fair, it is not right, and the American people
won't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent by
Al Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf.

What Gore is doing is WRONG.  And every day that he continues
to contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or in
the media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers a
clear majority of American citizens.

That's why Election Integrity 2000 has started up a new
campaign to collect online letters and send them to Al Gore
urging him to concede the election NOW!

Al Gore always claims to be ""listening to the will of the
people.""  The fact is, WE are the people, and he is about to
hear from us in a big way.

But just in case this isn't enough, we'll also be sending daily
press releases to the leaders in the House and Senate as well
as the major news media informing them about the overwhelming
response we are receiving from American people demanding that
Al Gore concede.

Eric, this is a personalized message just for you.
Please go to the link at the bottom of this message to sign your
letter to Al Gore.

Do NOT forward this e-mail.

In the couple of hours, I'll send you another e-mail for you
to forward to every friend who might be interested in sending a
message to Al Gore that America wants him to concede.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

Controversy Rages Over Democratic Effort to Suppress Military
Absentee Ballots

 ""...I happen to believe that, the military personal who sent
 their ballots in, should be allowed and should be counted...
 And I think we should look into it,  because we realize that
 when some of those ballots were sent off, many times the
 aircraft or the other vehicle utilized to transport them had
 to get on and they had to leave without the post marks. So I
 think the military should have some latitude in allowing
 those individuals to vote....""
     - Sheila Jackson Lee, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00

 ""...if he wins he is going to be Commander and Chief, I
 think he [Gore] ought to weigh into this and say, 'I really
 want this straightened out because it is only fair and right
 to do that.'""
     - David Gergen, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00

 ""I mean, here we are -- a week ago, we were having the
 groundbreaking for the World War II Memorial, we were all
 praising veterans and servicemen. This week, President
 Clinton is in Vietnam talking about reconciliation, and it
 all involves veterans and all involves active duty service
 personnel. And it seems to me that just in fairness...I
 think the general statement ought to be, 'Let's make every
 effort to count these ballots.'""
     - Bob Dole, NBC's Meet the Press, 11/19/00

 Tim Russert: ""Will you today, as a representative of the
 Gore campaign, ask every county to relook at those ballots
 that came from armed services people and waive any so-
 called irregularities or technicalities which would
 disqualify them?""

 Senator Joseph Lieberman: ""I don't know that I have that
 authority.  I don't believe I do legally or in any other
 way.""

NY Post Editorial
A Desperate Man, A Desperate Act
11/19/00

""How dare you, Al Gore?

""How dare you steal the right to vote from young Americans
serving their country overseas?

""From young soldiers and sailors sworn to defend unto death
the right of Americans to select their leaders - one vote per
person, one vote at a time?

""These are the real questions now facing the nation.

""Everything else is clutter.

""Friday afternoon, Gore strode purposefully to a bank of
microphones outside the vice-presidential mansion in
Washington and said:

""'The American people want to make certain that every vote
counts and that every vote is counted fairly and accurately.'""

""So far, so good.

""Then came word that Gore campaign operatives, armed with a
detailed how-to memo from Democratic lawyer Mark Herron, were
working furiously to trash military absentee ballots -
presumably because these votes were deemed more likely to be
for George W. Bush than for Al Gore.""

Why Hand Counting Is Unfair and Inaccurate


PALM BEACH COUNTY
 ~ Taping chads to ballots.  At least two witnesses noted
   ballots with tape over the chad of hole three, the
   Governor Bush hole.  Teresa LePore, the election
   supervisor, brushed off these mistakes.

 ~ Bush ballots in the Gore pile.  Both Friday night and
   Saturday morning, Bush ballots were found in the Gore pile
   to be counted as Gore votes.  A Democratic observer found
   these.  The Democrat observer later apologized to the
   Republican counterpart, telling him that the stack of
   ballots was different the prior night and had been
   sabotaged.

   Example:
    ~ Jim Williams, a Republican observer, witnessed Democrat
      observers picking up a handful of Gore ballots and
      finding several Bush ballots.  They tried to explain
      why Bush and Gore ballots were mixed together but
      couldn't.
    ~ Instead of pulling out the Bush ballots, Teresa LePore
      stacked all the ballots and put them into a box without
      any explanation to the counters or Palm Beach
      Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton.

 ~ Ballots as fans.  The Chairman of the Palm Beach
   Canvassing Board -- Judge Burton -- warned counters to not
   use ballots to fan themselves.

 ~ Elderly counters overworked and burned out.  Counters are
   working from 7AM to 10PM each day -- sometimes even later.
   Counters, many of whom are elderly, are exhausted, angry
   and burned out.  The room is poorly lit.  On Thursday
   night at 1AM, an elderly counter dropped 20 to 50 ballots
   over the floor, creating a huge scene.  Other observers
   stepped on the ballots.

 ~ In two precincts, the result has been so flawed that a
   second manual recount had to be conducted.

 ~ Counters are provided with no instruction and little
   guidance.  Because the Commission is canvassing at the
   same time that people count, counters often roam the room
   with their hands in the air, asking for guidance.

BROWARD COUNTY

 ~ Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors
   for the county the next.  Steven Michaelson of the public
   defender's office admitted in court Friday that Democrats
   are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors.

 ~ Different standards at different tables.  There are
   untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors
   at the next table how to conduct the count.  Affidavits
   from Florida residents serving as Republican observers
   state that there is confusion, multiple touching and
   passing of ballots between inspectors, moving precinct
   ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were
   already being counted, etc.

 ~ Conflicting statements.  A Broward County attorney said a
   manual count requires machine error, yet the board
   reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count
   despite no machine problems.  Canvassing Board Chairman
   Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no
   evidence of equipment problems, and that he was surprised
   by the very small number of changes discovered (+4 for
   Gore).

 ~ Falling chad on the floor, on the counting tables, on
   chairs, etc.  There is no reasonable assurance to voters
   that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure
   the integrity and security of the ballots.  The canvassing
   board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the
   counting until they do so.  Election officials,
   specifically Judge Lee, have simply expressed that the
   chad should be brushed on the floor.  After the first day
   of counting, 78 chad were collected from the ground and
   tables.

 ~ Considering altering the rules to include ""dimpled""
   ballots.  Despite being a quarter of the way through the
   manual recount (approx. 160 precincts), the Broward County
   board is now considering including ""dimpled"" ballots as
   votes.  This has been the centerpiece of the Gore strategy
   to gain additional votes.

DALEY, CHRISTOPHER TRY TO KEEP HILL DEMOCRATS FROM
ABANDONING GORE
11/19/00

""Late last week, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley and
former Secretary of State Warren Christopher quietly
informed the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate,
Dick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, that if Gore couldn't win on
the hand recounts, the campaign would fold its tent, sources
told TIME. They cautioned that 'the principals aren't there
yet' --Gore and Joe Lieberman weren't yet ready to go along -
'but they will be.' Daley and Christopher would find a way
to get the message to them, TIME reports in its current
issue....

""Gephardt feared that if Florida's secretary of state
Katherine Harris certified a Bush victory, House Democrats
would start abandoning Gore. 'People are saying, Enough is
enough,' a leading Democrat said Friday. 'It's time to be a
good loser.' To buy time, Gephardt organized a Friday-
afternoon conference call for Lieberman and House Democrats.
About 120 phoned in to hear Lieberman's pep talk.""

GORE CAMPAIGN ATTEMPTS PRESSURE TACTICS
11/18/00

""Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher called the
Democratic lawyer for Palm Beach County's elections
supervisor to try to get the attorney to use his influence
to assure a manual recount would be conducted there, the
lawyer says.

""Christopher, who is leading the Gore campaign's recount
effort in Florida, made the phone call Thursday morning to
Bruce Rogow, who represents elections supervisor Theresa
LePore.

""'It was an effort to have me persuade my client to vote in
favor of starting the manual recount on Thursday. I told him
no. I told him we'd have to wait,'"" Rogow said.

""Rogow said he didn't consider it appropriate for
Christopher or Dershowitz to try to 'persuade me to give
certain advice to my client.'""

UPI Commentary
SLEAZE, SLEAZE, SLEAZE
11/18/00

""Desperate to win the White House, Democrats have used
several strategies to set up a victory at the end of the
day....

""Elector is a position of public trust, so some level of
scrutiny is fair. What is not fair, and is, in fact
sinister, are revelations that Bob Beckel, Democrat solon,
occasional host of Crossfire, and campaign manager for
Walter Mondale's failed 1984 presidential bid, may be
engaged in some of the most vile skullduggery since
Watergate.

""It is an admittedly strong metaphor but frighteningly
appropriate. Since the morning after the election, there
have been rumors afoot that some in the Democrat party might
make serious attempts to switch votes in the Electoral
College.

""If Bush wins Florida, he becomes president by one more
electoral vote than the required 270. If three Republican
electors switch to Gore, the Tennessean gains a majority and
wins the White House.

""According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and
elsewhere, Beckel, who has close ties to Gore recount team
leader Warren Christopher, is engaged in an opposition
research project targeting Republican electors.

""Calling his efforts 'information gathering,' he says he is
working independently of the Gore campaign.

""Bill Daley, the vice president's campaign chairman, has
publicly shied away from any talk of lobbying electors. 'I
think there is a presumption that those members who are
voting, vote based upon the election,"" he has said. 'I
believe the vast majority of them are legally bound. And I
would assume if you're legally bound, you believe you're
morally bound.'

""Anyone in politics knows 'opposition research' is a polite
synonym for digging up dirt. The threat explicit in Beckel's
project is that the lives of electors are going to be
examined and given the same treatment Larry Flynt gave
former Republican Congressman Bob Livingston.

""Beckel told the Journal his procedure is to 'call on mostly
Democrats, but some Republicans too, and ask 'Who are these
electors, and what do you know about them?' That is what
blackmailers do too. Democrats need to call, today, for
Beckel to stop and use heavy hammers to insure that he does.
The presidential election must not be decided based on late
night phones calls to electors asking 'Hey buddy, who was
that woman you went with to Las Vegas last year?' Decency
and liberty demand it.""

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.  

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Christie was held without a point in last week's game against the Dolphins, 
but don't expect the same this week against the Colts. Christie is a solid 
Fantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between 
two teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.  

 Sylvester Morris , WR KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the 
Kansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics. ""I 
missed the majority of camp, so there's not that much wear and tear on me, 
but it's still a long season,"" he said. ""It's not so bad physically. But 
every morning I get up early, earlier than I ever had to in college. In 
college, you could schedule your classes. I never had a class before 10 
o'clock. Now I'm (at the practice facility) by 8 every day. That's a 
difference.""

WASHINGTON, DC-- An increasingly desperate Al Gore called for a recount 
Tuesday of the

Board. ""There 
is reason to suspect that these nine votes were not properly counted and that 
as many as five 
justices who sided with Mr. Bush did not intend to do so,"" Gore said. ""It is 
therefore in the best 
interest of our democracy for the U.S. Supreme Court to suspend judgment in 
this case until we

Big 12: Applewhite eager to reclaim his job
By Mark Wangrin
Express-News Staff Writer

AUSTIN =01* It runs up and down the inside of Major Applewhite's left knee,=
 a=20
four-inch shiny pink speed bump of a scar.=20

If it could talk, it would tell of how the anterior cruciate ligament buckl=
ed=20
as its owner planted while trying to avoid a relentless Arkansas pass rush =
at=20
the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1.

It would tell of the reconstructive surgery by team orthopedist Dr. Carey=
=20
Windler, how the joint was whipped back into shape with hours of work and=
=20
carefully tended with ice bags and heat and extra stretching and anything=
=20
else Applewhite had read, heard or seen that would help keep his return on=
=20
pace.

If the joint could talk, it would tell people how everything's fine inside,=
=20
how Applewhite could drop back and plant, set up or scramble, in a real liv=
e=20
game today if one was scheduled.=20

If it could talk ... well, Applewhite might well be the happiest guy on the=
=20
planet.

Being a quarterback, team guy and newly inaugurated Student Government=20
representative, Applewhite tries to be diplomatic, but part of him wishes h=
e=20
wouldn't have to answer a steady barrage of questions about his knee, no=20
matter how well-meaning the fans might be.

""I don't want to be rude,"" he said last week. ""I just wish they'd stop=20
asking. I love them, appreciate them, but it's getting a little ...""

Got the picture.

OK. So here's the word: Applewhite is 100 percent =01* even ahead of schedu=
le.

Ready to take on the challenge to his starting job from sophomore quarterba=
ck=20
Chris Simms, who with only one career start has graced the cover of The=20
Sporting News football preview and had an ESPN Magazine cover shoot last we=
ek

This word on Applewhite's fitness comes not just from the junior player, bu=
t=20
from the man who's worked most closely with him, physical therapist Allen=
=20
Hardin.

Applewhite, Hardin stresses unequivocally, is ready to play now.

Hardin said Applewhite has tested 5 to 10 percent above the expected range=
=20
when he's had periodic strength and flexibility tests on the injured leg.=
=20
During rehab, Hardin ditched the pool work, concentrating instead on=20
sport-specific movements, shortly after Applewhite observed that very few=
=20
football games are played under water.

One of the most effective of the workouts involved pulling on Applewhite wi=
th=20
rubber tubing as the quarterback moved, cut and set up, strengthening his=
=20
supporting muscles and improving his balance.

""If I came in and told him to do what he did yesterday, he wasn't happy,=20
because he wanted to be challenged,"" Hardin said. ""It was a challenge to co=
me=20
up with things to challenge him.""

""The only difference I can tell about the knee is it takes longer to warm=
=20
up,"" Applewhite said. ""I'll jog for four minutes instead of two, stretch fo=
r=20
six minutes instead of five.""

After workouts, Applewhite dutifully ices his knee, though he does so based=
=20
more on conventional wisdom than necessity.

""I've always heard you can get tendinitis, so I ice it,"" he said. ""I don't=
=20
have any of the symptoms, so it feels like I'm icing it for no reason.""

In some ways, Applewhite feels he's better for the injury, not the least of=
=20
which being a renewed appreciation for the game.

""So what if I'm tired?"" he said. ""I can rest when I die.""

Resting now isn't a bad thing, either. Applewhite said missing spring drill=
s=20
was a boon for his arm.

""I was throwing so much during the spring (of 1999), summer and season that=
=20
it felt like my arm was run ragged,"" he said.

Of course, the knee questions will be answered the first time Applewhite=20
takes a hit in the fall. The other question, the one that he can't shake,=
=20
will take a little longer.

Who's the starter going to be =01* Applewhite or Simms?

""I'd be quick to drop in comments about Chris,"" Hardin said of his=20
occasional, and apparently unnecessary, mention of Simms as a motivational=
=20
ploy. ""But I think internally, he'd have worked that hard whatever.""

""It's remarkable the way he's come back,"" said sophomore cornerback Roderic=
k=20
Babers, noting that Applewhite has been occasionally overthrowing even the=
=20
speediest receivers in workouts. ""In two-a-days, it'll be a fair fight.""

Asked to size up how Applewhite and Simms have looked in informal workouts,=
=20
Babers said, ""I think (Simms) has the advantage. Major's been sitting out a=
nd=20
Simms' confidence is up, big-time. That's what you need in a quarterback. B=
ut=20
at the same time, Major's a veteran. He's beaten Nebraska. He's beaten them=
=20
all.""

""He's the same old Major,"" cornerback Quentin Jammer said.

Soon Applewhite will probably be as tired of talking about the quarterback=
=20
duel as he is about answering questions about the state of his knee. Now, a=
=20
month before the freshmen report on Aug. 13, he's talking about how he's no=
t=20
competing against Simms, just against himself.

""The competitive nature that Tiger Woods has is the competitive nature I=20
have,"" Applewhite said. ""At Pebble Beach, Tiger was up 15 and had a 10-foot=
er=20
on the last hole for birdie, and he was out there lining it up. He could ha=
ve=20
done the 'Happy Gilmore' tap to the hole and still won. But he wanted it al=
l.""

Simms has bulked up from 208 to 223 pounds, working on his leg and upper bo=
dy=20
strength.

""I feel like there's more to me now, that it's not like the wind's going to=
=20
blow me over,"" he said. ""I don't want to be a wimpy quarterback. I want to =
be=20
like Brett Favre. He's not the biggest or the fastest, but he can run when =
he=20
has to and he can chuck it 80 (yards).

""It's going to come, and it'll get worse,"" Simms said of the building=20
scrutiny. ""To tell you the truth, I don't care. Football's a competitive=20
sport. There's nothing you can do about it.""

So he shrugs it off for now, concentrating on finishing up summer school.=
=20
He's working on his topic for a writing course, ""History of American=20
Baseball."" The book he chose is about Babe Ruth.

In August, the topic switches to college football. The question remains the=
=20
same. And Chris Simms, or Major Applewhite, won't write this story.

They'll live it.

The Secret Service agent who was booted from an American Airlines flight on Christmas Day has hired a team of Washington lawyers to press his case that he was the victim of ""profiling."" Actually, the accusation has changed somewhat since the agent--identified by The Weekly Standard's  Christopher Caldwell  http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/000/735hkywz.asp  as Wallid Shatter--first lodged the allegation last week. As we  noted Friday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001658 , a press release from the  Council on American Islamic Relations  http://cair-net.org/asp/article.asp?articleid=559&articletype=3  claimed that the pilot had singled him out not only because he is Arab-American but because he is Muslim--though how anyone was supposed to have known Shatter's religion is a mystery. (Did he unfurl a prayer rug in the aisle of the airplane?) Presumably the folks at CAIR are aware that three out of four Arab-Americans are Christian.

CNN reports the pilot submitted a report on the incident to the airline:

*** QUOTE ***

In the report, the pilot said the incident began when a flight attendant said she and other flight attendants were concerned about the actions of a passenger. The passenger had left the aircraft while leaving a carry-on bag still in his seat, telling flight attendants not to leave without him.

While the passenger was away, the flight attendants ""observed books in the individuals (sic) seat which were written in what she assessed was Arabic style print,"" the pilot wrote.

When the passenger returned, the pilot decided to review the paperwork required by law enforcement officials who carry weapons onto planes.

""The form was unreadable because it was a carbon-copy and there were missing items,"" the pilot said. ""I then had the agent come back and re-check his credentials"" and fill out a new form, the pilot said, but the new form was ""filled out improperly.""

The passenger ""appeared nervous and anxious,"" the pilot said.

The pilot said that as he tried to verify the Secret Service agent's credentials, the agent ""became very hostile.""

""In the interim, I was given a third improperly filled out (form). This had no signature of the (law enforcement officer), no phone number.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Shatter, of course, was carrying a gun, which, as a law-enforcement agent, he was entitled to do--but one can hardly fault the pilot for wanting to be absolutely certain the firearm-toting passenger was who he claimed he was. It's certainly easy to imagine, and even to sympathize with, Shatter's becoming ""hostile."" Airport-security bureaucracy can be maddening, and as a cop, he's probably not used to having his authority questioned. But one also must sympathize with the airline, which, as Caldwell notes, has of late ""seen a good deal of its personnel and clientele blown out of the skies by people who fit Shatter's profile."" He goes on:

*** QUOTE ***

Or, if you don't like profiling, let's ignore Shatter's profile for a moment. Christmas would have to be a high-alert day--a day on which a bomb or a hijacking would have especially great news value, and on which both security and in-flight personnel were likely severely understaffed. Some guy who claims to be going to see the president tries to get on a plane--with a gun--and the captain doesn't like the look of his paperwork. Specifically, Shatter was taking Flight 363 because he had been bumped from an earlier flight. According to the captain, the information he gave on the form for the second flight didn't match the information he'd given on the same form for the first.

Then, to top it off, the guy tries to get back on the plane. Have you ever left a sweater or a cell phone on a flight and tried to get back down the jetway? Being a forgetful person, I have. What happened, even before September 11, was that everyone standing near the gate surrounds you. If you show the slightest hint of insisting (""Aw, come on . . . that sweater's got my return ticket on it""), they get ready to call the cops. I was never (up until September 11) a big fan of this kind of draconian security on airlines. But the point is, the airlines have a longstanding record of not messing around when it comes to access to their planes--no matter what the passenger's color is. When American Airlines spokeswoman Laura Mayo says the incident was not about racial profiling but about ""confirming that an armed individual is who he says he is and that he is qualified to travel,"" we ought to believe her.

*** END QUOTE ***

Caldwell quotes CAIR head Ibraham Hooper: ""If [Shatter] had had the name John Smith and hadn't been of Arab-American background, there wouldn't have been a problem."" Wrong, says Caldwell. "" 'John Smith,' trying to board the flight with the same gun and the same iffy paperwork, would have been booted unceremoniously, and you'd never have heard another word about it, because Smith has no 'civil rights' groups to agitate for kid-gloves treatment. In fact, if Wallid Shatter had been named John Smith, American Airlines would now be demanding an apology from him, rather than vice versa.""

India Gets Serious  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570023-2002002040,00.html

Last month's attack on the Indian Parliament pushed New Delhi to the edge of its patience with Pakistani-backed terrorism, the Times of London reports:

*** QUOTE ***

From ordinary working men and women, up to Atal Behari Vajpayee, the Prime Minister, there is a strong consensus that the Kashmiri insurgency, which has been dragging on for a decade, with support from Pakistan, must be tackled with the same determination that the United States has shown in its campaign against the Taleban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan after the attacks on New York and Washington on September 11.

*** END QUOTE ***

Another Times report  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570023-2002001379,00.html  says the terror group Lashkar-i-Taiba, which is believed to have perpetrated the Parliament attack, has threatened to blow up the Taj Mahal--a Muslim mausoleum. And the  Press Trust of India  http://www.hindustantimes.com/nonfram/030102/dlfor77.asp  picks up a  Washington Post  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54251-2002Jan2.html  report that, as PTI puts it, ""President Pervez Musharraf has left terrorists in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) free to continue their activities in Jammu and Kashmir, confining his mild crackdown to Pakistan proper.""

National Review's  Jay Nordlinger  http://www.nationalreview.com/impromptus/impromptus010302.shtml  takes an optimistic view of Musharraf:

*** QUOTE ***

Pakistan and India moved toward war after the attack on the Indian parliament by al Qaeda-like militants from Pakistan. Musharraf responded that Pakistan was prepared for war if it came to that: but he made unmistakably clear that the Pakistani militants were enemies of Pakistan itself. He said that such militants had engulfed the country in a ""nightmare."" He said that Pakistan faced an ""internal challenge"" as much as an external one. He said, ""No wicked, bigoted extremist will be allowed to derail us, and we, the vast, silent majority, must vow not to be voiceless, passive onlookers to our own internal destruction.""

You won't often find me tipping my hat to a military dictator: but it's hard to see how anyone could ""ride the [Pakistani] tiger"" more ably or more daringly than Musharraf is doing it now. And let us hope that he is right about that ""vast, silent majority"" part. I suspect he is. But they had better recover their voice. Perhaps, through this dictator/leader, they are.

Did the Caged Bird Sing?  http://kausfiles.com/

Speaking of optimism, here's Mickey Kaus's take on the courtroom defiance of the ""20th hijacker"":

*** QUOTE ***

Is everything what it seems? If you were accused terrorist Zacarias Moussoui, and you really had been part of the 9/11 al Qaeda plot, but you'd broken down and were blabbing everything to the authorities, would you want to give that impression in open court, making yourself a potential target for your former comrades? Or would you seem defiant and say ""In the name of Allah, I do not have anything to plead""? Just a thought.

So Long, Salam  http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020103/main1.htm

Pakistan has refused to grant political asylum to the Taliban's former ambassador to Islamabad, Mullah Abdul Salam, the Frontier Post reports. ""It is also learnt that these Taliban leaders have also been officially asked to leave Pakistan at the earliest.""

Arab Rocket Science  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2002/01/03/News/News.41049.html

Hezbollah,  France's favorite terrorist group  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001676#french , tried to help Hamas acquire ""homemade Katyusha rockets"" to use in attacks on Israeli civilians, the Jerusalem Post reports:

*** QUOTE ***

According to the Palestinian Web site Al-Bawaba, Palestinian security officials told Time magazine last month that the rockets are a locally produced adaptation of a North Korean design, and that Hizbullah had acquired the rockets from Syrian soldiers in Lebanon and passed them on to Hamas. The rockets were then smuggled into the Gaza Strip, where a Hamas engineer began duplicating them.

*** END QUOTE ***

Shin Bet, Israel's security agency, foiled the plan when it ""arrested a Hamas operative at the Rafah border crossing as he attempted to travel to Saudi Arabia to organize funding for the project."" The suspect, Osama Zuhar Hamed Karika, ""told investigators that he was instructed . . . to travel under the pretext of wishing to make a pilgrimage to Mecca; once there, he met with Hamas officials and solicited financial backing.""

Iranian Rocket Science  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2002/01/02/LatestNews/LatestNews.41021.html

The Post also reports that an Iranian newspaper is criticizing ex-president Hashemi Rafsanjani's threat to destroy Israel with nuclear weapons:

*** QUOTE ***

Rafsanjani told a crowd at the stadium in Teheran University that the day is approaching in which the Islamic world will possess atomic weapons.

""On that day, the strategy of the West will hit a dead end, since a single atomic bomb has the power to completely destroy Israel, while an Israeli counterstrike can only cause partial damage to the Islamic world,"" he said.

*** END QUOTE ***

Noruz, a reformist newspaper, criticized Rafsanjani and, ""saying the ex-president's statements caused damage to the state's national interests.""

Our Friends the Belarusans  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54510-2002Jan2.html

""Belarus is quietly acting as a leading supplier of lethal military equipment to Islamic radicals--with terrorists and militant organizations in the Middle East, Balkans and Central Asia often the recipients,"" Mark Lenzi writes in a Washington Post op-ed:

*** QUOTE ***

While it is deplorable that Belarus's weapons have been responsible for prolonging civil wars and internal strife in countries such as Tajikistan, Angola and Algeria, it is particularly disturbing that Sudan, a country where Osama bin Laden used to live and one that is known as a haven for terrorists, has obtained from Belarus such proven and capable weapon systems as T-55 tanks and Mi-24 Hind Helicopter gunships. Weapons sent from Belarus to Sudan either fall into the hands of terrorists or are used in a civil war that has already killed more than 2 million people. . . .

Despite strong denials from Lukashenko, Belarus has been a key partner of Saddam Hussein in his effort to rebuild and modernize Iraq's air defense capability. Belarus has violated international law by secretly supplying Baghdad with SA-3 antiaircraft missile components as well as technicians. Given that Iraq has repeatedly tried to shoot down U.S. and British aircraft patrolling the U.N. no-fly zone--with more than 420 attempts this year alone--covert Belarusian-Iraqi military cooperation is disturbing and should set off alarm bells in Western capitals.

Women for War  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54012-2002Jan2.html

The Washington Post quotes Celinda Lake, ""a Democratic pollster who is an authority on reaching female voters,"" as saying the war on terror has drawn strong support from the fairer sex:

*** QUOTE ***

Lake . . . said Bush's war message has had the unusual effect of appealing both to ""women on the left who are concerned about rights and equity and traditional feminism, and to women on the right who were concerned about the Taliban's treatment of female Christian missionaries."" Lake said this is the first war in which polls have shown American women to be as supportive of the hostilities as men.

*** END QUOTE ***

""This is big news,"" comments  Andrew Sullivan  http://andrewsullivan.com/ . ""And the economy may be perking up as well. If I were a Democrat, I'd be worried right now.""

Stupidity Watch
The real purpose of World War IV is to increase property values, according to  John Stigloe  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2002/01/02/carollloyd.DTL , a Harvard professor. ""The federal government was badly shocked after Sept. 11,"" he tells the San Francisco Chronicle. ""The elites thought they had to get the American people focused on something else. And so we're bombing the hell out of Afghanistan. I'm sorry to say this, but I think that's what this whole war on terrorism is all about: It's about maintaining urban property values. It is necessary to do whatever they can to keep people willing to pay exorbitant prices for a small apartment in Manhattan or San Francisco or Los Angeles.""

Sean Penn  http://www.nydailynews.com/2002-01-02/News_and_Views/Daily_Dish/a-136912.asp , ex-husband of Madonna, doesn't like Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly. Now, we'll admit O'Reilly is an acquired taste, but Penn really doesn't like him. The New York Daily News reports that in the forthcoming issue of Talk magazine, Penn manages to compare O'Reilly unfavorable with Joe McCarthy, Osama bin Laden and even Hitler:

*** QUOTE ***
 
I think that people like the Howard Sterns, the Bill O'Reillys and to a lesser degree the Bin Ladens of the world are making a horrible contribution [to society]. . . . I'd like to trade O'Reilly for Bin Laden. . . . This is not a man sitting on the toilet with a smile on his face. He's a grumpy, self-loathing joke. There's a long history of people who capitalize on the lowest common demominator of people's impulses, Adolf Hitler being one of them. Not everybody wants to hit the wall in a violent rage and break their knuckles, so [O'Reilly] does it for them. He'll get very rich and get his rocks off that he's powerful. . . . These guys--Joe McCarthy, Bill O'Reilly--die like everyone else. And when they do, their legacy is one of damaging the spirit of good things, and they become rather broken, pathetic figures. And that is going to happen to him.

Don't Know Much About History  http://www.wral.com/News/1160696/index.html

Ben Ruffin, chairman of the University of North Carolina board of trustees, claims in a speech in Chapel Hill that, as WRAL-TV puts it, ""black Americans have known terrorism for hundreds of years, and few people have cared about their suffering."" It's certainly true that, as WRAL puts it, black Americans ""been the victims of bombings, lynchings and other acts of terror."" But if Ruffin really thinks few people have cared about their suffering, he might want to brush up on his history--specifically the Civil War, Brown v. Board of Education and the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

Will They Boycott Quarters and Dollar Bills?  http://www.usatoday.com/life/2002/2002-01-02-washington-portrait.htm

USA Today reports on an effort by New Jersey businessman William Sanders to hang portraits of George Washington in classrooms. Sanders persuaded the New Jersey Assembly to pass a bill that would require the first president's portrait to be hung in all Garden State classrooms, but it died in a Senate committee. What's amazing about the story is the knee-jerk opposition to this innocuous proposal from all the usual suspects:
-Nancy Volte, New Jersey Education Associaiton: ""Requiring legislation to honor one person does a disservice to many individuals. There are so many others who were also instrumental in securing our country's freedom.""
-Stephen Rohde, president of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California: ""I'm very suspicious of forced patriotism. Probably it would be constitutional if a school district or school system required George Washington's picture in every classroom. [But] I'm suspicious about imposing something one would hope that school districts would voluntarily want.""
-Lee Formwalt of the Organization of American Historians: ""George Washington, yes, played a critical role. No one will deny that at all. But to get a full understanding of the American past, we have to include all the different groups that played a role.""
-Currie Ballard, historian in residence at Oklahoma's Langston University: ""America was not a pretty place for black people when George Washington was president. Our people were still in slavery. . . . This country doesn't have much to celebrate when it comes to 200 years ago and its treatment of people. I love my country, and that's why I can say that.""

Buddy Clinton, RIP  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56485-2002Jan3.html

It hasn't been a good year for Bill Clinton. Not only is his legacy in shambles, but now his dog is dead after having been left home alone in Chappaqua, N.Y. ""Buddy, former president Clinton's ebullient chocolate retriever, was killed by a car near the Clinton home, police said Thursday,"" the Associated Press reports. ""Officer Bruce Cathie of the New Castle police said Buddy was accidentally struck Wednesday afternoon on Route 117, a busy two-lane road at the end of Old House Lane, the cul-de-sac that includes the ex-president's home.""

Bill and Hillary put out a statement through spokeswoman Julia Payne: ""We are deeply saddened by Buddy's death. He was a loyal companion and brought us much joy. He will truly be missed.""

also I know you will have many things you would like to do at home tonight.
There is no way to say thanks for the great two days.  You are always so
gracious and generous in every way, time, thought, etc.

I really enjoyed going with you to your office and now I can picture you each
day.  I found it very pleasent to sit at your desk.  Please tell Patti that I
enjoyed meeting her.

Thanks so much for taking me to see the interesting shop, and I will look
forward to going there again and using my generous Mother's Day gift
certificate!!  I am still thinking about the table I saw there-it is not a
lot larger than the table I have, but I like the fact that it is a cabinet.

It was very interesting to see your house and what has been done and what you
plan to do with your furnishings.  I think it will be wonderful and I look
forward to seeimg it all finished.  Keep me posted on what is going on and
what decisions you make.  I really do think you and your family will enjoy
the spacious large room.

I do hope David will have good news about his problem and hope that it can be
easily treated.

I thoroughly enjoyed the recital, and I think Amanda played beautifully.
Please tell her that I am so proud of her with the way she is doing in her
music, with the wonderful gold medal, and also doing so great in her school
work.  I hope she has a great two weeks at camp, and I am sure that you will
send me her camp address.  When you have time we can plan her visit time.

It was fun seeing Meagan, and she was very thoughtful to bring Michael by to
see us.  I mentioned to her that if she just wanted a change of scenery after
she goes to camp we would love for her to come over and visit.

Tyler was so much fun too, and especially now that he really knows who we are
and is comfortable with us.  We better stay strong and well so he can have
some visits with us!

I know I probably have forgotten something, but  the visit with you was
great.  Thanks you for being such a loving, thoughtful, and generous
daughter.  I am very proud of you.

Kathryn has done a good job of keeping me in the loop on this.  In addition, Kim has consistently provided useful, objective feedback, as shown in the memo attached below. 

We will produce a stable code with the changes Kim and her team have requested before the package is released outside the building.

I have also asked Kathryn to perform more testing within the CL team before asking Kim and her team (or any other clients) to play with the changes.  Performing significant changes overnight, and then showing the code to clients the next morning is wonderfully responsive, but a little too risky.

The high-level demo scheduled for Thursday will show code that is already frozen and hardened.

All the best,

    ENA VP Pre-Ranking Committee Meeting -July 7    =20


As we move into the Spring/Summer of 2000, it is time to turn our attention=
=20
to the performance review process.  Mid-year is always busy and we have a=
=20
number of important tasks and projects in process.  While recognizing this,=

it remains extremely important to take time over the next few weeks to gath=

necessary information to provide quality and meaningful feedback for our=20
employees, as well as utilize this information during the year end review=

process.

In the spirit of One Enron, the Performance Review Process (PRC) will be=20
global for Mid-year 2000.  Vice Presidents and above across all operating=

ENA has received favorable feedback on the review process used for Mid-year=

=20
process for Mid-year 2000.  The following are key features of the Mid-year=

as opposed to quantitative.  Toward this end, communication of the employee=

o Creation of 3 standard feedback forms for all peer groups. =20
o Standardization of criteria for all peer groups.
o   Utilization of a consistent 6 gradation rating scale. =20

David Wall - Credit
Tim Poullain-Patterson - Metals Integration

Kevin Rhodes - Metals Controller ( there are in fact two controllers at 
present Kevin for Financial Trading and Howard Carter for Merchanting )

I would leave Ralph Jaeger of Frankfurt out of the offsite if places are 
restricted  - He is covered by the mainstream Accounting conferences, but I 
would have Jan Erland, and Heidi and Tiong Hock from Singapore.

I am not sure Fernley would want to be there - but I can ask.

On others  - Simon Thurbin of liquids in london should be in Houston and 
would be a good choice for inclusion. Brent may want his two London 
controllers of Cindy Horn and Kenny Nicoll to also come

Would you invite Kristen to come with( in place of Barry? ).

A long list ( and we may want to cut back ) but all these individuals carry 
the burden of operational risk assessment and management - standardising that 
process would be an achievement indeed.

and responsibilities and I appreciate the fact  that you have taken the 
initiative to do so.  However, I do have the following comments:

1) I have some accountability to Rick Buy for the success of this effort, 
therefore I (or my designee) need to be involved in Doorstep pre- planning 
and post-mortem.  I will be involved in reviewing the final report before 
presentation and will attend  the meeting when the report is presented to Buy 
and Causey.

2) I realize that  in the interest of getting a review done timely it is 
sometimes necessary to ""divide and conquer"".  However, where logistically 
possible, I believe that it makes sense for my people to be involved in 
meetings held with Commercial personnel.  This facilitates understanding 
operations, document flow, points of contact, report writing as well as 
furthering our goal of educating ""multi-functional"" people so that we can 
continue to reduce the resources necessary to perform these reviews.

3) There are still some detailed issues that need to be clarified regarding 
the database.  Let's schedule another meeting with Cassandra and Donna.

*  North American Gas has now decreased its overall average daily EOL deal 
count by about 500 trades a day since November.  There are now approximately 
2,633 trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being traded on EOL.

*  The Financial Desk in North American Gas has increased its average daily 
EOL deal count by about 45% since October, from 494 to 714 deals per day in 
November.  In December, the average daily EOL deal count was down 8%, from 
714 to 658 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily EOL volume has 
decreased steadily in December.

*  ECC Canada West Gas has decreased its average daily EOL deal count by 
about 46% since November, from 213 to 113 deals per day.  In addition, the 
average daily EOL volume has decreased about 40% since November.  However, 
the average daily Non-EOL deal count has only decreased by about 10% since 
November, from 88 to 79 deals per day.

*  US West Power has decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 71% 
since November, from 187 to 54 deals per day.  However, the average daily 
Non-EOL Deal Count has decreased by only about 21% since November, from 171 
to 136 deals per day.  The average daily combined EOL and Non-EOL volume has 
remained steady.

*  US East Power has decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 24% 
since November, from 167 to 127 deals per day.  However, the average daily 
Non-EOL Deal Count has actually increased by about 3% since November, from 
230 to 237 deals per day.  The average daily combined EOL and Non-EOL volume 
has increased by about 20% total.  These recent trends in Power may indicate 
a shift in on-line power transactions from EOL to our competitors.

*  LPG's has steadily increased its total monthly EOL deal count from 281 in 
September, 398 in October, to 444 in November.  In December,  LPG's appear to 
have levelled off with 449 deals completed in December.  The total monthly 
EOL volumes have increased similarly as well.

*  Coal trades have decreased significantly from the levels seen in October.  
The total monthly EOL deal count for November was only about 23% of the total 
in October.  The total monthly EOL deal count for December was only about 83% 
of the total in November.

*  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has risen by approximately 47% since 
November, from a daily average of 242 to a daily average of 357 for December.

365,"We need to run a little project over the next week or so.

I think it is time that you have someone inventory all the projects you have going in your group, sit down and go over them with me and then you and I make sure they still have support from a business unit or make sense at all.  Some of them involve IT resources and some don't.

I just want to take a breath for a moment and make sure every project you are doing (outside the daily operations that are so critical) is necessary and still has a sponsor at a business unit.  If not, we can stop several side projects and focus on the critical ones, save some money and make sure we get the 5 to 10 things that absolutely have to be done completed.

Your thoughts?

366,"As you all are aware, there is a heightened awareness throughout the company 
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing 
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success 
at achieving those standards.  I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on 
meeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in 
an extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their 
gas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review 
to start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement 
methodology for the London office.

In order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards 
across Enron, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment 
for the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and 
other commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and 
Wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.

I have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so 
that we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those 
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not 
operating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to 
develop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:
 - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash 
collections are timely)
 - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its 
maximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date 
with            exceptions noted)
 - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard 
(i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)
 - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each 
measurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)

I would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control 
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of 
work has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time 
requirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to 
be completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a 
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but 
it is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.

As discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for 
each functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk 
associated with each control.  I would like to achieve consensus on gas and 
power operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know 
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process.  I look forward 
to seeing you next week.

370,"This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option 
pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and 
calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls 
are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will 
result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index 
premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

is still an ENA group, even though we have John reporting to you.  I would 
not roll that up under Global Products as it exists today.  We did review him 
in our PRC.  For some reason, HR has confused the issue with the Pulp & Paper

took I believe without any outside direction.  Does this make sense to you?

381,"I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message and the means of delivery.  On the means of delivery, I 
am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.  Is 
there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a 
letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be 
sent)?  Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead 
in to the article?  

With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally

403,"Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller 
Forum.  I know that we are catching you before a tee time on Monday, so I 
especially appreciate your joining us to kick off the event that morning.  
Dress for the forum is casual, so feel free to do the same.  There will be 
approximately 30 Enron business controllers present at the meeting.  All have 
responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following Enron 
entities:  Enron North America, Enron Europe, Enron South America, Enron 
Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband Services and Enron 
Energy Services.  Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, 
Sydney, London and New York (metals business).   

Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes 
before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to 
be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.  


You are scheduled to address the group as follows:

Date:  Monday, October 23, 2000
Time:  8:00 am
  (breakfast will be served at 7:30 and you are invited to join us)
Place:  The Warwick Hotel
  The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 
  5701 Main Street
  Houston,  TX  77005

With a small group, your talk can be informal and you do not need to prepare 
slides (unless you would like to do so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key 
speaking points that would enforce the value of this conference for this 
group would be:

recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 
2000 
your support for global standards for operational controls for trading 
activities
your recognition of the value of operational professionals in the 
organization to ensure integrity of mid and back office functions  
your challenge to the group to strive for best in class processes and 
controls as Enron's growth as a trading organization continues

Let me know if you have any questions and thanks again for joining us.

462,"Rick:  Recently I received an E-Mail that you and Louise Kitchen discussed my group's $544k allocation for 2002 to ENA and determined that it was incorrect and should be only $109k with the balance of $435k going to Kevin Garland's group.  Actually I did take into account the transfer of the merchant investments to Kevin's group in coming up with the $544 allocation.  For the last several years our allocation to ENA has been in excess of $1.1 million so it is less than one-half of historical levels.

The $109k is definitely low considering the following services we perform for EA:

	1)  Don Rollins and one of his Sr. Analysts spend nearly 100% of their time supporting the Thompson/Josey oil and gas group 	in due diligence, transaction structuring, document preparation, auditing, partnership liquidations, asset sales, etc. (As you 	know Don creates value several times his salary just in audit recoveries for ENA)

	2) Even after the transfer to EPI, ENA still has over $850 million in assets that are maintained in PortRAC, Dash Library, and 	certain of these asset have Watch list reporting etc. This takes at least one analyst's time.

	3) There are other due diligence areas for ENA we support such as power.  We have been pretty active recently in power plant 	purchase due diligence and actually have two of our experienced due diligence managers at a data room this week.
	
	4)  We are going to lead the effort to develop a DASH numbering ""AFE type"" cost control system with ENA being the first 	customer.

Please let me know your thoughts.  We had previously allocated Garland's group $544k.  If they pick up another $435k, I think that will be excessive and Kevin will be complaining.    Regards!

Water Disposal:  The current rate of water production has been established as 
a compromise between what we think is most effective for removing PSH and 
what we think are reasonable disposal costs. Our objective is to flush out 
PSH that is trapped in dissolution channels and fractures in the aquifer. 
Dewatering is not an objective because the shallow aquifer is too prolific a 
producer. In an effort to flush out trapped PSH we pump 200 bbls of 
groundwater twice weekly (or 1600 bbl per month). In addition we manually 
remove any accumulated PSH from recovery wells that do not have pumps in 
them. Pumping 200 bbls per cycle takes about 24 hours and is adequate to 
create a significant drawdown of the aquifer in the immediate vicinity of the 
former pit area. The aquifer will recharge within 24 hours, but we don't 
start another cycle until after about 60 hours in order to limit the number 
of cycles to two per week. The number of cycles is limited to two per week 
primarily for cost considerations, but also because our minor permit 
specifies a maximum disposal rate of 400 bbl per week. If we were to limit 
the number of cycles to one per week we would drop our PSH removal efficiency 
by nearly 50%; likewise, if we were to increase the number of cycles to four 
per week we would increase our removal efficiency by nearly 100%. Note that 
beyond about four cycles per week, there will be a deminishing advantage to 
increasing the number of cycles due to the time it takes to draw down the 
aquifer and the time it takes for the aquifer to recharge. Cycling the pumps 
twice per week also fits well into our O&M schedule for other sites in the 
area. We are spending about $3,200 per month for O&M at this site, about 
$1,800 per month on water disposal and $1,400 for O&M labor. These costs are 
directly proportional to the number of cycles per week that we operate the 
pumps. In regard to the effectiveness of this scheme, we have seen some 
positive indications in both a reduction of accumulated PSH in the former pit 
area recovery wells and a decrease in dissolved phase contaminants at monitor 
wells downgradient from the former pit area. An exception to this is the 
accumulation of PSH from what appears to be another source located west of 
the former pit area. This issue is being addressed by the installation of 
additional recovery wells. Another note regarding water disposal, we had 
briefly discussed the possibility of irrigating produced water rather than 
hauling it. We temporarily dismissed this idea over concern that arsenic 
contained in groundwater might accumulate in surface soil as a result of 
irrigation. We should revisit this idea next spring if it appears that 
pumping will continue much longer.

Monitor Wells:  Although the additional wells that we have planned should 
adequately delineate the dissolved phase plume, I am reluctant to think that 
these will be the last. The TRC recently rejected closure requests for about 
a half-dozen ENA sites. In a recent meeting between the TRC and David Ayers 
(for ENA), the TRC requested that ENA return to the sites and delineate 
dissolved phase contaminant plumes to MCL concentrations. Although the TRC 
has not yet made that request for this site, it is certainly a possibility. 
This is also consistent with recent draft guidance documents prepared by the 
TRC that specifies plume delineation to MCL concentrations. Currently, 
arsenic is the only contaminant in groundwater that is not delineated to MCL 
concentrations, more specifically, downgradient and east of the release area. 
We will have to wait and see what results we get from the new wells before we 
have a better idea whether any additional wells may someday be required. 

Recovery Wells:  This is totally dependent on what we find with the 
additional recovery wells. I suspect that we are going to confirm a separate 
source of PSH and will require additional wells to adequately remove PSH.

     COPIED FROM A NEWSGROUP POSTING - (the author is responding to a
woman who accidentally walked into the men's restroom):

     Please don't feel bad. It wasn't you entering the men's washroom
that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the
time. It's rare us guys ever hit what were aiming for.

     Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start
spinning around; just so I'll make sure I hit something.

     You see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men's
penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because
all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his
penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his
left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I'm telling 'ya those little buggers can't
be trusted.

     After being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I'm no longer
allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee.
She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she had
gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee soaked
toilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat
down, she was going to kill me in my sleep.

     Now another thing us guys don't usually like to talk about, but
because you and I have become such good friends and you think I'm a classy
guy, I might as well be candid with you because it's a real problem, and you
ladies need to be understanding. It's the dreaded ""morning wood"".

     Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire
to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter
how hard you try, you can't get that thing to bend, and if it won't bend you
can't aim, well hell, if you can't aim you have no choice but to piss all
over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on
putting on the toilet.

     And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers,
the friggin' toilet seat won't stay up by itself. So that means we have to
use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control
our less than perfect aim.

     Now sometimes, when you're newly married, (and I know the guys in
here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with
that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy
thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that
compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet
seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys will
not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it's just not safe.

     I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I
told her... look, it won't bend. She said, ""so sit down like I told you to
do all the rest of the time."" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with
""morning wood"".

     Well it's is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and
before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on
the wall across the room.

     Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down
under the toilet seat, when you start to pee the pee shoots out from the
crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You
piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs
on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor
in front of the toilet.

     I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning
urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position laying over the
toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split
time precision but it's the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl
during the first morning pee.

     So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to
blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom
cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control.

     It's not our fault, it's just Mother Nature.

     Now, if it was Father Nature, there wouldn't have been a problem!!!

Are we in it for the money? Not when it comes to ""payment for order 
flow""--an industry practice that can create conflicts of interest 
between brokerage firms and their clients. Learn how Datek's dynamic

our customers. Where we stand on ""Payment for Order Flow"" 
The Learning Curve
There sure is a lot of talk about over and under in the stock market. 
For example, technical analysts (chartists) look for stocks that are 
either over bought or over sold. And value investors seek stocks that 
are undervalued, in the hopes that they'll soon become fairly valued 
(or even over valued!). But one of the lessons we soon learn is that 
these terms are always relative, and that historical comparisons can 
be misleading. To help make sense of valuations these days, take a 
useful look at ""It's All Relative"" from Smart Money University.* It's All Relative

509,"  Bill, we had an air inspection at the facility a couple of weeks ago and 
all went well.  Prior to the state visit, we went through a ""trouble 
shooting"" scenario and found out that Solar provided us with innacurate 
permitting information for that altitude and temperature.  Solar was very 
helpful and provided us with updated information to reflect conditions at the 
facility.  I submitted a permit revision and it was submitted to the state of 
Colorado prior to their inspection, requesting more fuel but no more 
emissions.  Recent testing has shown that even under extreme low 
temperatures, the emissions are under the original permitted levels.  Because 
we did not request additional emissions, I expect the permit to be issued 
within the next couple of months..... bottom line is that no NOV will be 
issued for the fuel use issue.

510,"I attended a TXOGA pipeline committee meeting yesterday and the Grandfather 
legislation was discussed in detail. The following information is in addition 
to the previous message on this legislation:

Several members could not agree on whether the option being offered by TNRCC 
of using old standard exemptions to ""authorize"" grandfathered emission 
sources would be pulled off the table on September 1, 2001. The general 
consensus is that companies should complete the process of using the old 
exemptions by September 1 in case TNRCC does not allow this option anymore;

Although the legislation allows 0 to 20% reductions on pipeline engines in 
West Texas, TNRCC has indicated that they will not require reductions in West 
Texas, except for ""huge emitters"". No one knows what they mean by huge 
emitters;

TNRCC is required to reduce compressor engine NOx emissions by 50% in East 
Texas, but MAY require 50% VOC reductions in East Texas. No one has heard 
whether TNRCC will require VOC reductions. VOC reductions on a 2-cycle 
engine, especially on a Cooper engine with good combustion characteristics, 
could be problematic;

The TXOGA Pipeline committee will take the lead on responding to the 
regulations that are developed due to this legislation. I will certainly 
participate in this process.

534,"Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air 
Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 
C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this 
issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further 
actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was 
received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of 
interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing 
smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide 
vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to 
simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received 
permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, 
Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher 
turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not 
make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by 
Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is 
authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern 
from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this 
turbine at their descretion.

In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a 
emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than 
the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 
were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be 
mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple 
cycle.   

  Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to 
be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the 
Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern 
has 30 days to request another hearing. 

Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and 
handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a 
conference call for sometime next week? ","Transwestern Soalr Mfg Transwestern

536,"I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to 
submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency 
originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the 
TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the 
emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are 
the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 
inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 
tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would 
submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The 
only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an 
increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this 
facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from 
the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that 
the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I 
have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed 
for this facility in the near future.  

In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if 
there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit 
on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with 
previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that 
this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 
(emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed 
from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating 
throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make 
written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list.

With the recent tragedy, I am unsure when the following invitation will
arrive to you via the US Mail.  As many of you know, the US Mail is highly
dependent upon our nation's airline system for the normal on-time delivery of
cross country mail (normally within 3 to 4 days) which is mailed over
approximately 600 miles.  For the time being (and not sure when the
prohibition will be lifted) the nation's passenger carrying domestic and
international aircraft will not be allowed to fly mail or cargo in the cargo
holds. This measure may go away soon or measures be made for increased x-ray,
etc.  However, this may result in delays of mail depending upon how much the
trucking and rail industry can ""absorb"" in the cross country movement.  The
following invitations to the upcoming Change of Command were mailed on
Tuesday, 12th Oct by the office of the Wing Commander of the 436th Airlift
Wing (Dover Air Force Base, DE) who will be ""my boss"".

I felt it best to send this e-mail just in case the invitation does not
arrive for weeks.  I hope you understand.  As I reflect on the weeks ahead of
taking command of the flying operations and port operations of this nation's
largest military aerial port and strategic airlift wing we are humbled about
the talents of the great many men and women of this operations group as they
fly our nation's most precious and important cargoes to all faces of this

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

A year later, energy crisis shows no signs of cooling off
By Ed Mendel 
San Diego Union Tribune
April 30, 2001 

SACRAMENTO -- The first anniversary of the California energy crisis is coming 
up next month, and as the Queen of England once remarked when the royal 
family seemed to deregulate, it's been an ""annus horribilis."" 

The horrible year for California began last May when electricity prices 
suddenly began to soar, triggering a debate about the cause of the mysterious 
price increase that is likely to continue for years.

It started when a three-day heat wave, from May 21 to May 24, set records in 
some areas of the state and drove up the demand for electricity as 
Californians sought relief with air conditioning.

More record heat June 14 in the San Francisco Bay Area strained the 
overloaded system of Pacific Gas & Electric and resulted in rolling 
blackouts, the planned temporary power outages that some fear may be routine 
this summer.

The average price of electricity on the now-defunct Power Exchange soared to 
$120 per megawatt hour in June, five times higher than the same month the 
previous year, and remained roughly at that level until skyrocketing to $377 
in December.

San Diego sounded the statewide alarm last summer as San Diego Gas & 
Electric, the first utility to be deregulated, passed along much of the 
higher cost of electricity to its customers, until legislation rolled back 
and capped the utility's rates in September.

The executive director of a San Diego consumers group, the Utility Consumers' 
Action Network, thinks the generators and the marketers of power, using 
sophisticated computer methods, learned something as the heat wave drove up 
the demand for power.

""It was the first time the generators had an opportunity to see how high the 
price could go,"" said UCAN'S Michael Shames. ""It was their primer. It was 
Gouge 101.""

State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, who chaired a two-house committee that 
completed the deregulation plan in 1996, had seen routine monitoring data 
suggesting that the power market was being manipulated to drive up prices.

Peace took the unusual step last June of personally urging the adoption of a 
much lower price cap by the board of the agency that makes last-minute power 
purchases to maintain the grid, the Independent System Operator.

But the motion failed by a single vote. The consumer representative who cast 
the decisive vote against the lower cap resigned afterward with a blast at 
Peace, complaining of heavy-handed pressure.

Peace is unapologetic. He believes that stronger action by the ISO last June 
would have sent a signal that might have discouraged market manipulation.

""It's just like the Federal Reserve mis-timing an interest-rate move,"" Peace 
said.

The former ISO chairman, who represents generators, cited an ISO report 
attributing the price increase last May to the heat wave, power plant 
outages, less hydroelectric power and higher prices for the natural gas used 
by power plants.

""I think all of those things showing up at the same time resulted in 
significantly higher prices,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones of the Independent Energy 
Producers.

Why power prices remained at high levels and even soared last winter, instead 
of dropping as usual, is more difficult to explain.

The ISO contended last month that generators overcharged by more than $6 
billion from last May through February. But federal regulators, who have 
their critics, have found only $125 million in overcharges, making it an 
""annus marvelous"" for generators.

BODY:

??California stepped up its war on the power industry Thursday as state
legislators offered to pay millions of dollars to ""bounty hunters"" who provide
information leading to the arrest and conviction of energy executives and 
others
who manipulate the electricity market.

???California ""is being plundered by an energy cartel,"" said Lt. Gov. Cruz
Bustamente, who is promoting a bill that would level criminal penalties for
exploiting energy markets. ?""If what they are doing isn't illegal, it ought to
be.""

???Bustamente was one of a crowd of state leaders who went before microphones.

???On the floor of the Assembly, Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, rallied 
his
Democratic colleagues behind a bill to create a state power authority with
equally blistering attacks on private power suppliers.

???But after Thursday's hearing before a Senate committee formed to 
investigate
alleged price-fixing in the energy market, committee chairman Joe Dunn, 
D-Garden
Grove, told a reporter: ""I've never seen this much smoke when there wasn't a
fire.""

???Power generators insist they are operating fairly and say there is no
evidence of them acting outside the law.

???Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers
Association, dismissed the harsh rhetoric as unproductive. ""Putting people in
prison isn't going to encourage more generation,"" Smutny-Jones said, warning
that the political posturing would make energy generators think twice about
investing in California.

???Also on Thursday, experts said federally ordered caps on wholesale
electricity prices won't necessarily mean California will escape rolling
blackouts this summer.

HEADLINE: Santa Clara County, Calif., Joins Lawsuit against Electric Suppliers

BYLINE: By John Woolfolk

BODY:


??Santa Clara County agreed Thursday to join a lawsuit against power 
suppliers,
alleging they conspired to raise prices and boost profits while subjecting
consumers to higher bills and rolling blackouts.

??The county is the first to join the suit originally filed by San Francisco 
in
January. ?The suit seeks refunds for consumers of more than $ 1 billion in
alleged excess electricity profits.

??""The San Francisco suit contains significant allegations of manipulation and
collusion by the wholesalers, resulting in the disastrous consequences we're 
all
familiar with,"" said lead deputy county counsel Alan Tieger. ""We looked at the
evidence on which those allegations were grounded and found they were indeed
supported by the evidence, expert and otherwise.""

??The suit names a dozen electricity generating and marketing companies,
including Duke Energy and Enron Energy Marketing.

??Similar claims have been filed by three water districts in the San Diego
area, and two class-action lawsuits by private attorneys on behalf of 
consumers
are pending against power suppliers.

??The companies have vigorously denied the charges.

??""I don't think there will be any evidence of illegal activity by anyone,""
said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers
Association, when asked about various government probes.

GOVERNOR'S RATE PROPOSAL:

The Governor's proposal is designed to accomplish multiple goals, including
protecting consumers from extreme market prices by securing long-term
electricity contracts and implementing a tiered rate structure to reward and
encourage conservation. Approximately 53% of California households will not
experience any rate increase. The next 23% of residential customers will
experience about a 10% average increase. Residential customers who use the
most electricity (i.e., significantly more than 130% of the ""baseline""
figure listed on each customer's bill), will experience a rate increase of
24% on average.

to act on banning direct access.  Having said that, there are reports from
highly placed staff that an item to implement the AB-1X ban is being held in
Bilas' office, as he would like to see the legislative process run its
course, but there is a possibility that Lynch will reassign the matter to
another commissioner who opposes direct acess (Wood)in an effort to kill DA
before any other legislation is passed.  Please note:  The foregoing is
internal speculation/gossip from within the commission, and should not be
considered as confirmed.  Notwithstanding the controversy over implementing
AB 1X, Commissioner Brown has written a letter to Bowen endorsing direct
access and her bill, and publicly supported direct access in the Commission
meeting today.  That means 3 commissioners have voiced support for DA, and
only 2 opposed.  This again raises doubts over the accuracy of Bowen's
statement--which may have been designed to scare opponents into supporting
her bill.  We are attempting to get a copy of the letter sent by Brown and
will forward it to the lobbyists if we obtaining.  Stay tuned.  Mike Day

COMPUTER & ELECTRONICS PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
As technology continues to outpace our satiation with new gadgets and
increasing connectivity leads to increasing amounts of waste material,
producers must continue to refine strategies for effectively taking
responsibility for the entire life-cycle of their products. Challenged to
meet ever-more stringent demands from environmentally concerned
stakeholders, leading thinkers from Xerox, Philips, Mitsubishi Electric and
Pitney Bowes will share their innovative solutions to high tech product
stewardship, providing models which can be used broadly across many
industries.

THE NATURAL STEP
The Natural Step framework is a guide to thinking and acting in harmony wit=
h
the earth's cyclical processes. It provides a pragmatic framework that can
be used to guide social, environmental, and economic actions. It acts like =
a
compass that can point individuals and organizations in the direction they
want to go. Based on systems thinking, it recognizes that what happens in
one part of a system affects every other part, often in unexpected ways.

THE FUTURE OF ENERGY
Fuel cell technology and renewables are being developed to meet consumer
demand for more sustainable energy sources. Which are most valuable and cos=
t
effective? How have these new technologies been implemented in corporate
campuses? What direction will the future of energy take? Hear responses to
these questions from leading scientists and energy managers.

BIOMIMICRY
""Biomimicry"", coined by best-selling author, Janine Benyus, is created from
the Greek bios, (life), and mimesis, (imitation). Nature becomes a model fo=
r
designs and processes which can provide for more efficient, adaptable,
creative and resilient enterprise. Nature is viewed as a mentor we can lear=
n
from, and as a measure of our innovations: what works, what is appropriate,
what lasts.

CLIMATE NEUTRALITY
Global climate change has emerged on the environmental radar screen as a
potentially devastating consequence of economic and industrial expansion.
Today there is perhaps greater interest in the inventorying of greenhouse
gas emissions by corporations than there has ever been for a voluntary
environmental initiative. Hear how companies have successfully addressed
this topic with initiatives such as emissions trading, climate neutral
certification and increased resource efficiency.

CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY PRACTICE (C.A.P.)
Today, you serve not just shareholders, but a diverse community of
stakeholders as well. You don't just add value to products. You add values.
You're held responsible not just for your own actions, but for the actions
of your suppliers and your customers, your entire supply chain, anywhere in
the world. The objective of Manning Selvage & Lee's CAP is to protect and
enhance the value of your brand. Not through spin, but substance.

THE FOUR SEASONS OF BUSINESS
Spring is a time of planting many varieties of seeds. Summer's climate
encourages rapid growth of these new organisms. Fall is the season for the
development of a select few of those organisms creating more elaborate
interconnections. And winter is the time for reflection and  creative
destruction and renewal, opening space for a new generation of seedlings. S=
o
go the seasons of nature's ecosystems and the seasons of business. Learn ho=
w
to identify the different seasons of your enterprise and apply the
appropriate management practices for optimal productivity.

SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING
For the first time ever, assets under management in socially responsible
portfolios have exceeded $2 trillion, linking almost one in every eight
dollars under management in the U.S. with screened portfolios, shareholder
advocacy and community investing. As the financial marketplace expands to
meet SRI potential, traditional social screens are being re-evaluated, new
criteria are being created and the overall screening, activism and
investment impacts of SRI are being examined. Hear examples and approaches
from leading investment managers in the field.

BUSINESS ETHICS
Businesses now face a constellation of interests - market, social, and
environmental - for which the ability to continue adapting and regenerating
has become the central issue. From local communities to global financial
markets, from entire industries to the quality of air and water, executives
are influencing the sustainability of their operating environment. Learn ho=
w
an emerging new ethical code encompassing a company's responsibility for
society and the environment is closely linked with profitability and long
term organizational sustainability.

IMPLEMENTATION OF SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES
There is no shortage of theoretical solutions to current questions of
environmental and social sustainability for business. But what happens when
organizations move toward implementation? Hear practical case studies and
stories from companies like Hewlett-Packard and Nike about what has worked
and what hasn't when sustainability initiatives are implemented at the
organizational level.

GLOBALIZATION: RECONCILING THE INDUSTRIAL & ECOLOGICAL PATHS
Two simultaneous trends have emerged at the beginning of the 21st century:
the increasing dominance of industrial multinational corporations and the
diminishing state of the global environment. Hear experts from diverse
disciplines converse about opportunities for addressing these dangerous
trends.

Description:	Enron India Says Company Close To Deal For Telecom Data Network
Detail:	
11/29/1999 
Dow Jones Business News 
(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 



NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy giant Enron Corp. has signed a memorandum 
of understanding with an undersea-cable operator and is in advanced 
negotiations for a separate venture to build a fiber-optic telecommunications 
network, Sanjay Bhatnagar, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron 
India Ltd., told Dow Jones Newswires. 


The two projects are central to an aggressive foray by Enron (ENE), already 
known in India for its high-profile energy investments, into communications 
services.


Just as it is doing in the U.S., Enron hopes to build in India a national 
broadband network to improve data communications, including the use of the 
Internet. Initially, Enron aims to build a high-bandwidth backbone connecting 
seven large cities, each housing a data center -- a large bank of computer 
servers to facilitate Internet applications, such as hosting Web sites to cut 
time and cost for Indian Internet users. 


Bhatnagar said that Enron has signed an MOU with FLAG Telecom, which operates 
a network of submarine cables, to connect Enron's ""Indian network to the 
world."" The first leg of that network will be a high-capacity fiber-optic 
connection between India's capital, New Delhi, and the country's financial 
center, Bombay. Enron is currently finalizing a joint venture with Ircon, the 
construction arm of India's state-owned railways, to build and operate the 
New Delhi-Bombay link. 


""We are in the process of negotiating the detailed agreement,"" Bhatnagar 
said, adding that he believes the joint venture agreement will be signed 
within two months. 


Ircon is to hold a 50% stake in the joint venture, with Enron, British 
Telecommunications PLC (BTY) and Indian conglomerate Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. 
holding minority stakes. 


Bhatnagar said Enron is negotiating with several potential partners, which he 
declined to name, on other pieces of the Indian network. Likewise, in 
addition to the Indian railways, Enron is speaking with other bodies, 
including a highway authority, on gaining the right of way to lay fiber-optic 
cable in other areas of India. It is also likely to team up with private 
telephone networks and Internet service providers in the target cities. ","Sanjay Bhatnagar Bhatnagar Bhatnagar

625,"For those who attended section I promised to clarify whether the LM
needed to shift if a country on fixed exchange rates chose to devalue
when suddenly facing a higher risk premium.

Because of the risk premium and the outflow of capital at the prevailing
interest rate, r*, the absence of any central bank action combined with
allowing the exchange rate to float, automatically lowers the exchange
rate.  So no shift of the LM curve is required.

Basically the demand for assets denominated in the currency has declined
thereby putting downward pressure on the currency. The decision to float
the exchange rate ""accomodates"" this decline in demand and the central
bank does not need to increase money supply to cause the devaluation, it
happens on its own.

Of course, the new exchange rate should be pegged at the level where
r=r* + theta.  Now in the future, the central bank will do whatever is
required to keep the exchange rate at the new level.

For those who don't follow this, don't worry it is a fairly technical
point, but I wanted to make sure I clarified it.

This analysis is based on internal curves.  Please do not release without

The biggest refinement is that I made an adjustment for the fact that many 
contracts are gas indexed and their price falls.  Both gas and electricity 
have fallen since DWR released their numbers in late May.  I was able to 
replicate the total contract cost of $41 billion, which gives me some 
confidence in the approximations I have made.

It has come to my attention that you were concern by some of my comments
recently televised on CH. 2. Let me try to  fill in the blanks. First, the
interview lasted almost 45 minutes of actual camera time. Of course, the
news media took their usually advantage of editing ""for their agenda"" what
they wanted. The risk you take in any situation like this. During the course
of the interview, I made it quite clear that it would be a mistake to lay
California's current natural gas problems on the doorstep of deregulation.
No one should question I am strongly in favor of gas deregulation in the
state.

On a more direct point, Mr. Vacar was clearly trying to get me to confirm
what he had already been told before my interview that the culprit here was
Enron Online. I disagreed with that conclusion yesterday and this morning.
About 1/2 hour ago, Mr. Vacar phone me to presumably find out what natural
gas prices where doing in the spot market. He quickly brought the
conversation back to Enron Online. I told him that it would be a mistake to
blame these current day prices on Enron Online. While it is convenient for
some to look for a simple singular answer or someone to blame, the answer
isn't Enron Online. He went on to reason that Enron is such a large energy
company they could conceivably ""do this"". I responded that would also be a
mistake. I acknowledged Enron as a large player but in no way capable of
running up California Gas prices because of some ""perceived dominance"".

Yesterday, I shared my concern that Mr. Vacar was directing his inquiries
toward Enron with Mr. Fawcett. Obviously , I reserve my right to call them
like I see them independent from anyone of my clients own agendas and will
continue to do so. The source of potential allegations against Enron isn't
me. If I can clarify anything else let me know.

amount with 10-year  fixed priced power and the other half with 5-year fixed 
priced power.
3) create a portfolio with a) 25% of short position covered by 10-year fixed 
priced power, b) 20% of short position covered by 5-year fixed price power, 
c) 15% covered by 1-year fixed price power, d) 20% covered by May-Sept 
fixed-price power, and e) 15% from the PX.  

The term of each scenario is 5 years.

Because each is priced off our our curves, the average price is roughly 
equivalent for each of the three portfolios.  However, the graph shows (as 
one would expect) that exposure to price volatility is significantly higher 
under scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3.

The goal is to use the illustrative scenarios to persuade the industry that 
in the short run (i.e., immediately) the utilities should be permitted to buy 
a modest amount of power under 5 and 10 terms, and those purchases (if 
undertaken using a ""DealBench-like"" tool) ought to be ""per se"" reasonable.

If anyone has questions about it, or would like to discuss further, give a

to the contrary, it seems to me that wholesale markets are working .... they 
are open and they are competitive.  On the other hand, retail gas markets 
suffer from the same problems as electric markets ... they are not open,

Erik Magner has informed me that the academic version of Crystal Ball

discussed in class.  I was under the distinct impression that your version
would have the decision variable function but limited to two choices for
cells that could operate as decisions.  I would suggest that you try
Tools - Crystal Ball Decision and see if your software permits access.
If not, you may have to try several decision choices in separate simulations
(a little more tedious but this is essentially what Crystal Ball would do).
I spoke with the same person at Decisioneering, and she indicated the
student version of Crystal Ball should be able to set up the decision cells
and function correctly (as long as you go through the Tools - CB Decision

First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email.  Schedule i=
s=20
very tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this=
=20
morning, with some back-up info that I've included below.

Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f=
or=20
delivery to Sen. Brulte.  It's of course confidential.  Few points:

I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would=

As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on=20

our proposed legislation.
This email does not contain the legislation.  Mike sent the ""final"" version=

of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I=20
believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.
You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver =
to=20
his office today the proposed legislation.  Again, based on our call on=20
Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed=
=20
legislation to the rest of the world at the same time.
When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would=20
determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same=
=20
time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will=

handle that end of things.  Please let us know at your convenience to whom=

This email does, however, include a ""summary"" of our proposed legislation. =
=20
But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the=20
appropriate language to distribute ""to the world,"" or if we'll need instead=
=20
to tailor some new language.  I think we all agreed that we need a ""one=20
pager"" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the=
=20
package effectively.
We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our=20
proposals.  We didn't finalize that plan.  Perhaps the Sacramento team coul=

propose a plan to do that.  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the=

We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the =

legislative package/message.  We're in a meeting with folks today where we=
=20
can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted=
=20
Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.
You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR=

credit issue.  As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.=

You note that attached to the email is a ""legislative fix"" to AB1X that cou=

AES pullout won't affect privatisation: Prabhu
Anurag Prasad

08/04/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

NEW DELHI: Union minister for power Suresh Prabhu on Friday said the withdrawal of US firm AES from Orissa will not hamper privatisation of the power sector being carried out in various states. 
Speaking to Times News Network, Prabhu said: ""AES has decided to pull out from only the distribution of power in the state. They are not leaving India or any other project in the state."" He also added that the central government is not planning to buy Enron's stake in Dabhol power project.
AES has withdrawn its 51 per cent stake in Orissa's Central Electricity Supply Company. Cesco is one of the four privatised distribution companies in the state. Other three are Wesco, Nesco and Southco. 
Officials of AES, including nominated Cesco MD Roberto Podesta, are reported to have left Bhubaneswar. 
AES Corporation's investment in India includes $10 million in Cesco and Rs 603 crore for its 49 per cent stake in Orissa Power Generation Company. The company has expressed its desire to sell its stake in the distribution company to the government or any other third party. 
AES official said the tariff was not sufficient to meet the electricity cost. Reports say law and order problem and lack of government support to cut off power supply to non-paying customers have also been cited as reasons for the withdrawal. 
However, the company is not willing to leave other power projects in the state which includes OPGC. In May, AES closed down operations at a thermal power station in Banharpali in Jharsuguda district, 395 km from Bhubaneswar, for a week demanding the clearance of outstanding dues of Rs 1,400 crore from the state's Grid Corporation. 
AES is the third US company to have withdrawn from power sector in India. Cogentrix was the first one to pull out from the projects in Karnataka. Last week, Enron had offered to divest its 65 per cent stake in the controversial Dabhol power project in Maharashtra. 
In all the three cases, high tariff rates of electricity being sold by these companies and subsequent non-compliance with agreement terms have been the main reason for the withdrawals. The escrow accounts have also added to the dispute. 
Interestingly, Orissa was one of the first states to have opened its power generation and distribution system to private companies. After privatisation, reports indicate that there has been considerable improvement in distribution of power in the state and reduction in theft.

Petronet seals LNG chain, inks gas sale MoUs
Sanjay Dutta

08/04/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

NEW DELHI: Petronet LNG has signed memoranda of understanding with prospective buyers for liquefied natural gas to be supplied from its proposed Dahej and Cochin terminals. 
""We have signed gas sale MoUs with 18 prospective buyers, sealing the last, and most vital, link in the LNG chain,"" Petronet chairman SN Mathur said.
While MoUs have been signed with 13 buyers for 25.08 mmscd (million standard cubic metres per day) LNG from the Dahej terminal, five suppliers have signed pacts for 9.34 mmscd of gas from the Cochin terminal. This is nearly equal to the 7.5 mmtpa (million metric tonnes per annum) of LNG that Petronet plans to import from Las Rafan, promoted by the Qatar government. 
Petronet's agreement with Las Rafan has a stiff 'take-or-pay' clause, a global practice for LNG contracts. This had given rise to doubts over Petronet's viability in the absence of gas sale agreements. 
In the meantime, Qatar was pressuring New Delhi for offtake guarantees without which their investors were reluctant to pump in money, oil ministry officials said. This prompted the government to moot `intermediary offtakers', wherein it asked Petronet's four PSU promoters - GAIL, ONGC, IOC and BPCL - to make commitments for the LNG. 
Mathur, however, disagreed. 'Where is the question of intermediary offtakers. There is demand for gas which the promoter firms are unable to meet. What is wrong if they give offtake commitments, after all, Petronet is their company,"" he said. 
Though Mathur declined to give out the price at which Petronet has contracted the LNG, he said it was competitive and would be about 20 per cent cheaper than naphtha. 
He also expressed confidence that the project would get going by 2004. ""We have already awarded through global bidding EPC (engineering procurement construction) contracts for $300 million on lump-sum turnkey basis and assigned shipping contracts at the rate of $ 68,000 per day, which compares favourably against Enron's $98,000 per day,"" Mathur said.

ETHICS RULES APPLIED UNEVENLY; POWERFUL ENERGY CONSULTANTS RETAINED POSITIONS WHILE SOME LOWER-LEVEL WORKERS CHARGED WITH CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR OWNING CALPINE STOCK WERE DISMISSED FROM JOBS BY DAVIS ADMINISTRATION.

While the Davis administration moved swiftly in recent weeks to dismiss a handful of low-level energy contractors who had apparent conflicts of interest, a group of powerful consultants to the administration has enjoyed far more lenient treatment. 
These consultants earned $50 to $300 an hour for negotiating long-term electricity contracts, mapping energy needs and providing financial and legal advice. Of about 50 people involved in this work, only about half were required to fill out statements disclosing their personal financial interests. And of the five who did report energy investments, only one was dismissed.
By contrast, the state dismissed four people last week who worked in a cramped energy trading room at the California Department of Water Resources; their pay averaged $30 to $45 an hour. These people purchased power on the open market, but they had far less influence than others over how much the state pays for power. 
While the administration is giving the appearance of cleaning house, it is not holding all of its key employees and advisers to a rigorous ethical standard. And the firings have left a sour taste in the mouths of several traders who once considered themselves heroes for helping the state out in a time of crisis. 
''I am pretty much just a pawn,'' said Constantine Louie, 28, while packing his bags at a Sacramento-area motel where he'd been staying for most of the five months he worked for the state. ''It is just political. Somebody has to be the scapegoat.'' 
A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis disputed that. Press secretary Steve Maviglio said the people who were dismissed had stock in one energy company, San Jose-based Calpine, at a time when they were ''committing state resources.'' But there are conflicting reports on whether they had actually bought power from Calpine. 
Maviglio said higher-ranking consultants and other staffers who owned energy stocks -- including himself at one point -- either weren't in a position to buy from the power suppliers or had disposed of their holdings before they got into that position. 
The governor's staff has said other top advisers, including Wall Street experts Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman, weren't required to file disclosure statements. Late Friday, however, Fichera released a letter saying he had no energy investments. Hoffman also disclosed that he had no holdings except for options in an Oklahoma energy trader, the Williams Cos., which hesold at a loss in March. 
Problems arise 
Fueled in part by criticism from one of Davis' political rivals, Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones, the issue is only the latest fallout from an unprecedented energy-buying effort. That program was thrown together in just a few days in January, when the state's major private utilities were teetering on the verge of bankruptcy. 
With few experienced officials on the payroll, the governor's office and state Department of Water Resources turned to a handful of private consulting firms and about 20 individuals who were hired on short-term contracts. 
At the top of the heap are a handful of consulting firms, primarily Navigant Consulting and Electric Power Group. Employees from these two groups analyze energy demands, negotiate long-term power deals and manage the energy contracts. 
Energy-trading experts say these roles are the most critical to determining the price the state pays for power. 
''If you make mistakes on these long-term deals or the analysis, then those mistakes multiply down the road,'' said Steve McAleavy, a director for Search Consultants International, a Houston-based job placement firm that works with energy companies. 
At the same time, the Department of Water Resources has been forced to fill some of the state's needs by buying power on the spot market, and that's where the lower-level traders come in. Experts say there is little these traders can do to affect the price they pay for power. 
Scott Spiewack, a secretary for the Power Marketers Association, said traders at this point call a handful of other traders to see what price they're offering, then pick the best offer. 
Yet, despite having less responsibility and influence on power prices, it's this second group that has received the most scrutiny -- and felt the biggest repercussions -- during the recent controversy about conflicts of interest. 
Of the 26 people in this group, 20 were required to fill out disclosure forms, but not until roughly four months after they were hired. Five of those people owned stock in Calpine -- Constantine Louie, William Mead, Elaine Griffin, Peggy Cheng and Herman Leung. 
After complying with orders to sell their stock, four were dismissed anyway. The fifth, Griffin, resigned to take a new job. The state also terminated its contract with one long-term negotiator, retired Sacramento municipal utility executive Richard Ferreira, who had purchased Calpine stock the previous year. 
One other trader, Bernard Barretto, reported owning Enron stock but was not terminated because the state wasn't buying from Enron on the spot market, Maviglio said. 
''We had reason to believe from our review that the five who were asked not to return had violated the Political Reform Act or were close to it,'' Maviglio said. 
Department of Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo went further, saying the department terminated contracts with those traders who appeared to have been involved in official transactions with Calpine. But he also said the state was still reviewing all its transactions. 
Three of the six former contractors insist they had no official dealings with Calpine; others couldn't be reached for comment. 
Mead and Griffin both said Calpine wasn't selling power into the spot markets, where they operated. A Calpine spokesman said spot sales were rare, but they occasionally occurred. 
Ferreira says he didn't negotiate any contracts with Calpine. 
Except for Ferreira, the governor has been far more forgiving of revelations about possible conflicts involving top aides, state energy officials or consultants who perform more critical energy-trading tasks. 
This past week, Maviglio disclosed that he owned stock in Calpine, which he subsequently sold. In addition, William Keese, chairman of the California Energy Commission, acknowledged owning stock in companies that had sought plant licenses from his agency. Bruce Willison, a Davis appointee to the California Electricity Oversight Board, owns Enron stock. And Arthur Rosenfield, a member of the California Energy Commission, held 380 shares ofEnron stock. 
None have been asked to resign by Davis. 
Still working for state 
Four other Department of Water Resources consultants reported energy investments; they also remain with the state. 
* Vikram Budhraja, the president of Electric Power Group, reported buying two blocks of Edison International stock, each worth $10,000 to $100,000, on Jan. 17 and Jan. 22 of this year. A few days earlier, on Jan. 11, he also bought stock worth $10,000 to $100,000 in Dynegy, a Texas power supplier that is one of the companies the governor has accused of profiteering. He said he sold all his stock a few days after going to work for the state. 
* Mark Skowronski, a contract negotiator with Budhraja's firm, made several purchases of Edison stock in January and February. He also held stock in Reliant Energy, another major Texas power supplier, but sold that stock in March when he became the state's lead negotiator with Reliant. After first insisting there was no conflict in holding Edison stock, because he doesn't deal with Edison, Skowronski reported selling that stock in July. 
* Ronald Nichols, head of the Navigant Consulting group in Sacramento, disclosed that he bought $10,000 to $100,000 worth of stock in Enron, the giant Texas power marketer, in April. A Department of Water Resources spokesman said Nichols sold that stock last month. 
* Sumner White, a member of Nichols' firm also working for the state, reported one-third ownership of SRW Group, an independent power developer, and said he received $10,000 to $100,000 in income from AES, which owns several California power plants. 
Skowronski, Nichols and White couldn't be reached for comment. But Maviglio reiterated that they weren't dealing with the companies in which they had invested. 
''That's the big difference,'' he said. 
Budhraja, in particular, has been targeted for criticism from Jones, the secretary of state. While Budhraja said he sold his energy stocks Jan. 29, a few days after he went to work for the state, Jones says it appears that Budhraja's second Edison purchase was made three days after he went to work for the state -- just as California was beginning to buy power on the utility's behalf. 
The state's $6.2 million contract with the Electric Power Group indicates that the consulting firm was to begin work Jan. 19. But Budhraja says he didn't start working for the state until Jan. 25 -- after he bought the Edison stock -- and adds that he sold all his energy stock as soon as possible. 
In an interview, Budhraja rejected any suggestion that he knew he'd be working for the state when he made the investments. 
''That's absolutely wrong,'' he said. ''I was sitting in my office the morning of Jan. 25 when a call came'' without warning. ''I basically got in my car and went to the airport to go help out the state.'' 
Louie, the young trader who moved from Southern California to Sacramento, learned he'd been fired by checking his e-mail during a hiking trip in Peru, and he said he feels he was treated unfairly. 
''Perhaps it's like a peace offering'' to Davis' critics, Louie said. ''Like they are actually addressing the issue by terminating four of us . . . that might appease some critics, I don't know.''

LITTLE SANDY BILL PASSES IN SENATE

Summary: President Bush is expected to sign the legislation that adds 2,890 acres of watershed to the Bull Run system 
""While modest in scope, this bill is essential to ensuring that future generations of Portlanders will have the cleanest drinking water available."" -- SEN. GORDON SMITH,
WHO CO-SPONSORED THE BILL WITH SEN. RON WYDEN 
A bill that would add 2,890 acres of federal land in the Little Sandy watershed to Portland's Bull Run water supply system passed the Senate on Friday. It now heads to the White House, where President Bush is expected to sign it into law. 
The bill, which had the backing of most of Oregon's congressional delegation, would prohibit logging, road construction and public access on the acreage, securing a southern buffer for the 95,382- acre Bull Run system, supporters said. The two Bull Run reservoirs northwest of Mount Hood supply drinking water to 800,000 people in Portland and suburbs. 
The Little Sandy also serves as crucial habitat for endangered fish and trout runs, supporters said, particularly because Portland General Electric plans to decommission its fish-impeding dam on the river. The bill authorizes $10 million to be spent on watershed restoration in Clackamas County to benefit endangered fish runs. 
""The Little Sandy will be the centerpiece of a very aggressive effort to restore salmon,"" said Portland Commissioner Erik Sten, who oversees the city's response to the Endangered Species Act. 
Advocates have been trying to secure protection for the Little Sandy since 1994. Forest Service officials once argued that the legislation was unnecessary because the agency already has authority to prohibit logging if it would impair water quality. 
But two of the bill's sponsors, Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said they wanted to be certain that the watershed -- and Portland's drinking water supply -- would be protected. 
""While modest in scope, this bill is essential to ensuring that future generations of Portlanders will have the cleanest drinking water available,"" Smith said in a joint statement with Wyden. 
More than a third of timber in the Little Sandy watershed has been harvested, although the Forest Service is not currently logging there, the senators said. Further harvests could risk contamination of Portland's primary water source by reducing a natural southern buffer against fire, erosion and human intrusion, supporters said. 
The acreage covered by the legislation lies within the Mount Hood National Forest. It originally was included for protection by the Oregon Resource Conservation Act of 1996 but was left out before the law was enacted. 
The Senate passed a version of the bill sponsored in the House by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., that amends the 1996 law. The house passed that version last month. 
Earlier efforts to add the Little Sandy acreage to the Bull Run system failed in previous sessions of Congress because they lacked Republican support.

FERC has two meetings in July (July 11 and 25) and then is on recess for the month of August.  The next FERC meeting after July will not be held until September 12.  Consequently, FERC tries to get out as many orders as it can in July so the backlog is not as great in September.  

Consistent with that goal, FERC has included a lot of cases on its July 11 agenda.   While some of these cases may be stricken from the agenda for July 11(and either deferred to the July 25 meeting or until September), we are still expecting a lot of action from FERC in July.  The following cases are on FERC's July 11 agenda:

RTO Proceedings

Alliance RTO

SPP and Entergy RTOs

PJM and PJM West RTOs

New York RTO

New England RTO

RTO West

Southern RTO

Two new RTO dockets entitled ""Regional Transmission Organizations""

Other Proceedings

Mirant vs. ISO New England (June 20, 2001 complaint by Mirant regarding ISO's proposal to revise procedures for mitigation of generators run out of economic merit order during transmission constraints).

NYSEG v. NYISO (regarding ISO's hybrid fixed block pricing rule)

NERC (these are old docket numbers that go back to orders issued in 1999 regarding TLR -- Southern and VEPCO sought rehearing of the TLR procedures in June, 1999, arguing that they could result in shedding load.  FERC may be responding to those rehearing requests).

HQ v. NYISO (regarding HQ's request for FERC to order ISO to reinstate the May 8, 2000 market clearing price)

Maine PUC vs. New England ISO (regarding the PUC's complaint against the NE ISO asking FERC to direct the ISO to recalculate the energy clearing price on May 8, 2000).

California Proceedings

San Diego Gas & Electric v. Sellers (Docket No. EL00-95-038 -- several parties have already sought rehearing of the June 19 order -- this could be a non-substantive tolling order (putting on hold these requests for rehearing), or it could be something more substantive.

Edison bailout -- In a battle that pitted the yellow armbands against the
dark suits, an Assembly committee yesterday approved a plan it hopes will
keep Southern California Edison out of bankruptcy. Consumer advocates -- who
wore yellow armbands to make sure they stood out in a room filled with
well-dressed lobbyists -- said the plan would be a disaster matching
California's original 1996 electricity deregulation law. They vowed to
launch an initiative campaign to overturn the plan if it is approved by the
Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Gray Davis. Lynda Gledhill in the

Edison Bill Leonard -- Vowing for months that California Assembly
Republicans wouldn't support legislation to rescue utility Southern
California Edison from the brink of bankruptcy, one of the GOP's members
crossed party lines to help push through a bill during a key committee
hearing Wednesday that puts the utility one step closer to solvency. State
Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-Rancho Cucamonga, was one of two members of the
Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee who changed his vote in
order to advance the rescue bill out of the committee. Leonard was the only
Republican who voted in favor of the legislation. He left from the committee
hearing after voting for the bill and was unavailable for comment. Jason

Shaver land out of utility measure -- An Assembly committee agreed to allow
Southern California Edison Co. to hang on to thousands of acres of Sierra
Nevada land around Shaver Lake in its vote to keep alive a hotly contested
$2.9 billion rescue plan for the beleaguered utility. Lesli A. Maxwell in

Surplus power and MWD desalination plans -- It is a dramatic example of how
California's electricity forecast has morphed from shortage to surplus: The
giant Metropolitan Water District has restarted plans to strip salt from
seawater as a new source for Southern California's taps. For decades,
desalination has been talked of as a solution to the Southland's water
needs. And for decades, it has been dismissed as too energy-intensive to be
affordable. Nancy Vogel in the Los Angeles Times

Direct access -- Electricity marketers said Wednesday that they may sue
state utility regulators over their latest plan to end customers' ability to
shop around for power. The marketers, which compete with the traditional
utilities to sell power to business and residential customers, said they
were stunned by a draft decision by the California Public Utilities
Commission to suspend ""direct access"" retroactively to July 1. The marketers
have been rushing to sign up new customers in recent weeks, assuming that
the PUC decision would not take effect before Sept. 1. Nancy Rivera Brooks

????Nov. 29, 2000 - The Wall Street Journal (11/29, Smith) reported, ""Harvey 
Rosenfield, a consumer activist who has made a career of tapping public anger 
at corporate interests, is drafting a ballot initiative aimed at reversing <
electricity> deregulation in California. While Mr. Rosenfield has a mixed 
record of success with voters, his inflammatory rhetoric in the past has 
focused public attention on such issues as rising auto-insurance rates and 
quality of care at health maintenance organizations and helped bring about 
change."" Rosenfield ""now expects to tap into widespread indignation over 
soaring <electricity costs and impatience with regulators who can't agree 
about what is to be done. To get his initiative on the 2002 ballot, Mr. 
Rosenfield needs roughly 700,000 signatures on a petition, which he is 
expected to accomplish. Mr. Rosenfield also is expected to raise $7 million 
for his campaign; he has been able to raise money in the past through

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
04/05/2001


GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS DELIVERS
ADDRESS TO CALIFORNIANS ON
ENERGY

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis today delivered
an important live address on energy from his office in
Sacramento. The following are his
remarks as prepared for delivery:

""Good evening. I'm speaking to you
tonight from Sacramento on the most difficult issue facing
California: our energy crisis.

""Simply stated, we have two problems:
supply is too low and costs are too high. Both result from the
flawed deregulation scheme created in
1996. But no matter how we got into this mess, you hired me to
solve problems. And that's what I'm
doing.

""The only long-term solution is to
build more power plants. We must also cut back on consumption and
stabilize the utilities. But prices
won't fall and supply won't be truly reliable until we generate more
power than we consume.

""Yet in the 12 years before I took
office, not a single major power plant was built in California. Not one.
Since I became Governor, we've
licensed 12 major power plants. Ten more are in the pipeline. And
we're doing this without weakening
our commitment to clean air and clean water.

""Deregulation required the utilities
to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating
companies. The generators are free to
charge whatever they want because they're governed only by
federal regulators who refuse to
control wholesale energy prices.

""This past winter, the prices charged
by the generators shot through the roof, driving the utilities to the
brink of bankruptcy.

""In January, with the feds still
refusing to do their job, California stepped in to purchase the power the
utilities could no longer afford to
buy. We didn't take over to save the utilities. We took over to keep the
power on and the economy strong.
That's not all:

We also negotiated long-term
contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices.
I used my emergency powers to
seize control of low-cost power contracts the utilities were
about to forfeit to the
generators.
We began negotiations to buy the
utilities' transmission system.
We cut red tape and offered cash
incentives to speed up construction of power plants.
We're launching an $800 million
conservation program.
We're moving to establish a
public power authority to build more power. If the private sector fails
to build all the plants
California needs, we'll build them ourselves.
And because I share your concern
that the generators are ripping us off, we're using every legal
remedy to root out and punish
illegal conduct.

""We can't fix 12 years of inaction
overnight. But we're making real progress.

""Now, as you know, I have fought
tooth and nail against raising rates. It's become increasingly clear,
however, that with rising natural gas
prices, the feds' failure to control costs, and the state's lack of
supply, that some rate increases are
needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong.

""But I remain committed to protecting
average Californians from massive rate hikes. So I'm urging the
Public Utilities Commission to adopt
a plan that will protect average consumers, reward those who
conserve and motivate the biggest
users to cut back.

""Under my proposal, more than half of
you won't pay a penny more. For the rest, the average increase
will be 26 and a half percent. For
many of that group, rates will rise only about 10 percent. The heaviest
users will see their rates rise 34
and a half percent on average. That includes business paying their
share. This is in addition to the 9
percent surcharge we've all been paying since last winter.

""But all Californians can reduce
their bills through conservation.

""Here's the point: The more you use,
the more you pay. The more you conserve, the more you save.
Conservation is our best short-term
weapon against blackouts and price-gouging. By flexing your
power, you'll help secure our energy
future.

""Unlike the PUC, my plan includes
funds to restore the utilities to financial stability -- If they agree to
three main conditions:

""They must provide low-cost regulated
power to the state for 10 years. Agree to sell us their

Tannin Salon

One of the most ubiquitous words in wine reviews is ""tannin."" Wine 
writers never seem to tire of references to ""round"" tannins, ""ripe"" 
tannins, ""smooth tannins,"" ""tough"" tannins, ""gentle"" tannins, and 
""supple"" tannins. It begins to seem that, if you don't understand 
tannin, you don't understand wine (especially red wine). So just what 
the hell is a tannin? 

Tannins are organic compounds in plants, trees, roots, and bark - or, 
in the case of wine, skins, seeds, and stems. Tastewise, tannin 
doesn't impart a flavor but a texture. In concentrated quantities it 
sticks to the inside of your mouth, where it creates a puckering 
sensation - a sensory effect that senior wine.com merchant Tim Gaiser 
likens to that of overbrewed tea. 

""Tannin is astringent,"" Gaiser explains. ""If a wine has too much of 
it, it's out of balance. But tannin isn't a bad thing. It's a 
necessary component for wine to have structure and aging potential."" 

In other words, the more tannin a wine has, the better it will age? 
Not necessarily. ""If a wine has a lot of tannin that isn't balanced 
by adequate fruit and acidity, it won't age well,"" says Gaiser. 
""Eventually the fruit will fade, leaving nothing but tannin. Balance 
is the key."" 

Winemakers and vineyard managers can control tannin in several ways. 
""Ripeness of grapes dramatically affects the level and quality of 
tannins,"" says Gaiser. ""Wines made from grapes that aren't fully ripe 
often have green, stemmy, hard tannins. Ripe tannins are finer and 
rounder tasting."" 

In other words: supple. Given a suitable climate, ripeness (and its 
corollary, flavor development) results from such factors as low 
vineyard yields and long growing seasons, which allow extended 
hang-time for the fruit. 

Tannin quality also depends on the amount of time that a winemaker 
leaves fermenting grape juice (""must"") in contact with the skins - a 
process referred to as maceration. 

""One of the main reasons California Cabernets have gotten so much 
better in the last 10 years is that longer maceration times have been 
used,"" Gaiser says. ""What's improved more than anything is texture, 
which speaks specifically to tannin management."" In Bordeaux and 
California Cabernet, maceration times commonly last three weeks or 
longer, a period that enables tannins to grow rounder and gentler. 

Tannin isn't usually associated with white wines because they don't 
undergo maceration; they're pressed off the skins right away. (Almost 
all red grape varieties contain clear juice, so the color of red wine 
is attributable solely to extended skin contact.) But some white 
wines do gain tannin from the new oak barrels in which they're aged. 

""A lot of oaky Chardonnays are just as tannic as red wines,"" Gaiser 
points out. ""People don't usually take that into account, which is 
why Chardonnay can be so difficult to pair with food.""

749,"HEADLINE: ?Calif. Governor To Address State

BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN


DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

BODY:

???While Gov. Gray Davis prepared to speak to the state Thursday night about
California's energy crisis, economic forecasters predicted the power crunch
would lead to higher taxes and scrapped public projects.

??Davis said Wednesday he hadn't written his five-minute address, but that he
planned to discuss ''the progress that we've made and what we have to get
through.''

??Among other things, he was expected to talk about the more than 40 percent
rate increases approved last week by the Public Utilities Commission for
customers of the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
and
Southern California Edison Co. He has asked California television stations to
carry his remarks live.

??California has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power supplies
blamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs.

??On Wednesday, the state got more bad economic news: The UCLA Anderson
Business Forecast said Californians would face higher taxes and a tighter 
state
budget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency 
power.
The blackouts and the state's scrutiny of private power suppliers also 
threaten
to scare away new businesses, the report said.

??Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy
prices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a windfall-profits
tax on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to 
California
this year.

??A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly. It
would tax gross receipts that ''significantly exceed'' the cost of producing
power and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold 
it
at much higher rates.

??''We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap
enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This 
profiteering
must stop,'' Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said.

??Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selected
industry would be legal. He added that such a tax would discourage generators
from building new power plants in California.

??''The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can 
to
increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price.
Windfall-profits taxes do neither of these,'' Williams said.

??Davis said he generally opposes treating profitable companies in that 
manner,
''but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense. The only things
companies understand is leverage.''

??For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their
power from generators instead of going through the utilities.

??The Utility Reform Network and the head of the PUC oppose the idea. They
argue residential customers and small businesses unable to contract with
generators would get stuck with the bill for the billions of dollars the state
has and will spend buying electricity for the customers of the cash-strapped
utilities.


HEADLINE: 'Chaos' in state electricity planning

BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens

BODY:

??LOS ANGELES _ Two hundred of the finest economic minds in California 
gathered
Wednesday at UCLA's Anderson School of Management to discuss the state's 
energy
crisis but, as state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch 
spoke,
the power to her microphone cut out intermittently and unexpectedly.

??""I don't have any control over this,"" the beleaguered technician operating
the sound system called out after repeated outages.

??""I feel your pain,"" Lynch replied with a smile.

??No one in the audience doubted that. After two rounds of rolling blackouts
that state officials were powerless to prevent, Lynch last week led the
commission to hike retail power rates 42 percent, sparking protests from
consumer groups.

??But at UCLA Lynch had power and natural gas producers in her sights. She
promised to lead ""a war against the sellers who are taking so much value out 
of
the California economy and not adding a whit of value.""

??Lynch said she favored reinstatement of wholesale price caps that were ended
by the Federal Energy Rate Commission in December but wasn't counting on that.

??Even without those caps, she said she was optimistic that the state had
enough tools to restrain price hikes by wholesalers and avoid another rate 
hike.

??Those tools include conservation, purchases of long-term power contracts by
the Department of Water Resources, utility cost cutting and making sure the
small power producers known as qualifying facilities are online, she said.

??Lynch dismissed the state's 1996 deregulation plan as a ""failed experiment""
and said she did not accept a questioner's premise that ""true deregulation is
our goal."" The problem was that ""the state stepped back too much"" from
management of the power system and that there had been ""too much ideology and
theory and not enough practical solutions,"" she added.

??A panel of experts offered some grim predictions. ""We are expecting severe
difficulties for this summer and next summer,"" said Barry Sedlik, a Southern
California Edison manager.

??Mark Bernstein, an analyst with the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, said the
electricity problems are spreading. ""This may go on for a while and it's not
just California,"" he said. ""In the near term we've got chaos,"" he added.

??But he offered one macabre ray of hope. He said that federal policymakers 
may feel more urgency to step in if, as now appears possible, rolling 
blackouts occur in 2002 in Florida where, he didn't need to add, President 
Bush's brother is governor.

??Problems with the transmission system there, as well as generation shortage,
could hurt Florida but the state has enough time to avoid a crisis, he said in
an interview.

PG&E restructuring bid draws state ire 
By Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writers 
(Published Sept. 21, 2001)

In a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utility's valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants. 
To make the plan work, PG&E asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials. 
PG&E said the plan, a complicated blend of asset transfers, debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs, would restore the utility's financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state ""bailout."" Divorcing the utility from its parent company, the plan would pay off the entire $13.2 billion of debt PG&E accumulated during California's poorly executed era of deregulation. 
The plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, had the support of a key block of creditors, including independent energy generators, whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan. 
But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials, setting up a potentially fierce battle. Despite PG&E's claims to the contrary, they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PG&E could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants. The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
FERC ""has proven over the last 18 months to be ... no friend of the ratepayer,"" Davis told reporters Thursday. ""The PUC, while far from perfect, has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ... I'm very wary of PG&E's proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a non-regulated environment."" 
The PUC vowed to fight the plan in court. ""I don't think the judge is going to do it,"" said PUC President Loretta Lynch. 
Consumer advocates noted that PG&E has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants. ""It's complete piracy,"" said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco. ""It's the most audacious thing I've ever seen."" 
Filed six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection, the plan calls for PG&E to be spun off from PG&E Corp., but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent. 
That would violate a state law, passed as a response to the energy crisis, prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006. The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when out-of-state generators were charging ultra-high prices to PG&E and Southern California Edison. 
PG&E acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court -- a federal entity -- to override the state law. Legal experts said it's not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law, and in prior rulings U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali has sided with state officials. 
""Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws,"" said influential state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chair of the Senate Energy Committee. 
Robert D. Glynn Jr., PG&E's chairman, called the transfer a good deal for customers. He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about $50 a megawatt hour -- ""the lower end"" of current rates -- under a 12-year contract. 
But that's almost double the existing rates for those plants, critics said. 
And Gary Cohen, the PUC's general counsel, said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out, putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent, unregulated generator. 
""This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with,"" Cohen said. 
Despite the friction between PG&E and the state, the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers, regardless of how high they go. Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization, PG&E said. 
The plan also requires approval from federal officials and a ""yes"" vote from a majority of PG&E's creditors, along with Montali. 
Glynn said the plan could be completed by December 2002, enabling the utility to resume buying electricity. The state has been buying power for PG&E since January, when it became insolvent. 
While the PUC raised rates an average of 40 percent this year, the reorganization plan doesn't require another rate hike, Glynn insisted. ""From the customers' view, this transaction will be seamless,"" he said. The same should be true for most employees, he said. 
The PG&E chairman, whose company has feuded with Davis for months, also boasted that PG&E isn't ""asking the state for a bailout or a rescue"" -- a jab at Davis' as-yet-unsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibillion-dollar rescue for Edison. 
It's unclear what impact PG&E's proposal would have on Edison's attempt to avoid bankruptcy. Edison's creditors, already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the Davis-backed plan, might conclude that Edison is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court, analysts said. 
The PG&E proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PG&E Corp. split into two separate, publicly-traded companies. 
The utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric, would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets -- including its hydro and nuclear plants, transmission wires and gas pipelines -- to PG&E Corp. for $4.06 billion in cash and IOUs. PG&E Corp. shareholders would receive stock in the slimmed-down utility, although the details of the stock transaction haven't been worked out. 
The bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PG&E has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control. The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment. 
Despite the criticism, PG&E said removing those assets from regulators' oversight is essential to making the plan work. Why? Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets, said utility spokesman Ron Low. If the assets became property of PG&E Corp., the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts. Glynn said he's had ""in-depth discussions"" with investment bankers about issuing new bonds. 
Also, by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight, the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment, said credit analyst David Bodek of Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. 
If state officials fight the plan, ""the question arises, 'How do you discharge these (debts)?' "" Bodek said. ""Here's a plan that does that."" 
The plan would pay creditors $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in bonds. Creditors with debts of more than $100,000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds, which will be paid in 10 or more years, said Paul Aronzon, attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors. 
""There's some credibility here, and it works,"" Aronzon said of the plan. 
Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for independent generators, said his group would probably accept the plan, even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money. 
Shareholders also endorsed the plan. PG&E Corp.'s stock jumped $1.22, to $15.72, on a day when the markets took another bad fall","Jeff

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

You're so sweet for emailing me and saying such sweet things!  Do you know
that you brightened up my day?

I only have about 30 hours of school left.  I did okay on my test.  I should
have studied a little more, but I just didn't feel like it.  I'm feeling
comfortable about my project due tomorrow.  I find out tomorrow if I have to

I slept a lot last night - almost 7.5 hours.  So, I feel more up to the

I'm gonna send out a lot of the announcements today.  Mom emailed me the
rest of the addresses today, so I'll either do the rest tonight or tomorrow.

I'm going to tell Mom that I'm going to Houston this weekend.  I decided
that I should tell her since I may sign a lease next week.

Ford Looks Good in First Outing

Heralded freshman point guard T. J. Ford looked as good as advertised
Wednesday night in the Longhorn basketball team's annual intrasquad scrimmage.
Senior guard Fredie Williams, sophomore guard Royal Ivey and sophomore
swingman Brandon Mouton had 19 points each to lead the scoring, but Ford had
16 points and nailed a three-pointer with five seconds left to knot the score
at 75-75. Coach Rick Barnes called it a draw at that point.
The Longhorns, who tied for last in the Big 12 Conference in field goal
percentage during the 2000-01 season (.412), shot well.  Both teams connected
on better than 50 percent of their field goal attempts and three-point field
goal attempts during the scrimmage.
""Coming into the season, we knew we had to get better with our field goal
percentage,"" Barnes said.  ""I look at the stat sheet and I know we can shoot
even better than we did tonight.  I think we are a better driving team this
year, and that penetration will help our shooting.  I was pleased with
tonight, and I really like the chemistry on this team.""
The Orange team was led by Mouton and Ford, plus senior forward Chris Owens,
who scored 17 points. Ford's 16 points included four of six treys, plus eight
assists and just three turnovers.
Williams and Ivey led the White squad.  Sophomore center James Thomas had 15
points and a game-high 10 rebounds, while sophomore forward Brian Boddicker
scored 15 points (4-of-6 threes) and had seven boards.
A trio of Longhorns did not suit up for the scrimmage due to injuries,
including junior guard Terrell Ross (foot, ankle), freshman swingman Sydmill
Harris (achilles) and freshman forward/center Chris Wright (knee). Wright is
expected to redshirt this season to rehabilitate his knee. The other two
should return this season.
Texas is slated to play two home exhibition games at the Erwin Center
(Wednesday, Nov. 7 vs. Alaska Anchorage, 7 p.m.; and Tuesday, Nov. 13 vs. EA
Sports All-Stars, 7 p.m.).

Newcomers Star for Women

Freshman center-forward Mercedes Williams and sophomore guard Kaira White
scored 12 points each to lead the White to a 61-36 win over the Orange in the
annual Texas women's basketball scrimmage Tuesday.
Senior guard Asha Hill had 11 points, including a game-high three
three-pointers, and senior forward Dana Godfrey  finished with 10 points.
Sophomore center Stacy Stephens had nine rebounds to lead both teams in that
department and she also scored seven points for the White.
Senior forward Tracy Cook led the Orange team with 10 points and freshman
forward Jody Bell added seven points and six rebounds.
The White squad held a 37-30 edge in rebounding and shot 45% from the floor,
hitting 22 of 49 shots, while the Orange squad hit at a 33.3 percent clip
(16-for-48).
""It was a little shaky out there at first, but that's to be expected,"" coach
Jody Conradt said. ""You could easily tell who the returnees were by their
solid presence on the court, whereas the freshmen looked a little tentative
and uptight.""
""We are looking for our identity right now. We do want to run with the ball,
but we've got to work on pushing the ball up the court quicker, getting the
outlet passes released quicker and taking the ball out of bounds as fast as
possible.""

Game Quotes . .

""We played a very talented team that is well coached and is on a roll in the
BCS mix. It hurts when you throw an interception, have a punt return, a kick
return and a bad snap that all lead to eventual touchdowns and realize your
spotting Texas 28 points.
- Baylor head coach Kevin Steele
* * * *
""Early in the ball game, the defense did what it was supposed to do. It
stopped Baylor when it had to. Then the offense did what it was supposed to
do. It started scoring touchdowns. It got a little sloppy after that, but
overall, I thought we did a good job.""
- Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
""In most cases today, the run was outnumbered. We knew it would be hard, but
Cedric (Benson) did a good job for us, and we were able to get good matchups
in the passing game because they had to play Roy (Williams) and B. J.
(Johnson) and Sloan (Thomas) one on one. We ran two backs more than we have
in other games to try to get more blocking.""
- UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
""I might have gained 108 yards today, but it didn't come easy. The offensive
line did a great job today. Baylor played tough all day long. I feel like the
offense is starting to get into a rhythm. Hopefully we can keep stepping it
up more each week. I'm happy with the win. Every team in the Big 12 has
talent and winning on the road isn't easy.""
 - Longhorn freshman RB Cedric Benson
* * * *
""It's really competitive out there and we did a lot of things right, but we
made too many mistakes to beat a team as good as Texas.""
- Baylor wide receiver Reggie Newhouse
* * * *
""I thought we were going to make more big plays, and I got a little impatient
at times. Overall, I thought the offense played well and moved the ball and
scored some points.""
- UT quarterback Chris Simms
* * * *
""My eyes lit up when I saw that man-for-man coverage. We've got the mentality
that nobody can cover us man for man. I respect them for trying it. We
haven't seen a lot of manh coverage this year.""
- Longhorn wide receiver Roy Williams, who had six catches for 147 yards and
a touchdown
* * * *
""It was just like being at home. I wanted everyone to know I can compete with
the older guys, and that's hard to do when you're a freshman.""
- Texas freshman linebacker Derrick Johnson, talking about coming back to
Waco, where he starred for the Waco Lions, for the first time as a college
player

Scouting Kansas

Texas will host Kansas at 11:30 a.m. Saturday in the Longhorns' final home
game of the season. It will not be televised.
Texas is 8-1 overall and 5-1 in the Big 12. Kansas is 2-6 overall and 1-5 in
the Big 12. As if the Jayhawks didn't have enough problems, head coach Terry
Allen got the axe Sunday and one of his assistants was named interim coach.
Kansas opened the season with a 24-10 win over Southwest Missouri, then fell
to UCLA, 41-17. The Jayhawks lost at Colorado, 27-16, before upsetting Texas
Tech in Lubbock, 34-31.
Then they lost to Oklahoma, 38-10, fell to Missouri in three overtimes,
38-34, lost to Kansas State, 40-6, and fell to Nebraska, 44-7.
A pair of Texans lead the Jayhawk offense. RB Reggie Duncan of Killeen is
their top rusher, averaging 73.5 yards per game, and QB Mario Kinsey of Waco
is averaging 106.2 yards per game in total offense.
Kinsey is a scrambler who has 190 net rushing yards this season, despite a
lot of sacks.
This Kansas team has had its moments, headed by the upset of Texas Tech in
Lubbock, but it has too little offense (109th in the country) and too little
defense (90th in the nation) to compete with Texas unless the Longhorns mess
up royally.
Look for freshman RB Cedric Benson to have a good day against a run defense
that gives up 236.3 yards a game and for QB Chris Simms and his receivers to
light up the scoreboard, too.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Longhorn Notes . .
* Texas improved to 31-0 when outrushing its opponent in the Mack Brown era.
Conversely, the Longhorns are 4-12 when outrushed by their opponents under
Brown.
* Freshman RB Cedric Benson had 108 rushing yards, giving him 682this season
and moving him  into fifth on the UT freshman list. He is the eighth player
in UT history - and the first freshman - to rush for 100 yards in four
straight games. Benson also tied Earl Campbell's freshman record for 100-yard
games in a season (4). He ran for two scores, giving him seven rushing TDs
this season. That places him fourth on the UT freshman list, one shy of the
record of eight shared by Ricky Williams, Butch Hadnot and Graylon Wyatt.

Horns Compete at NCAA Track

University of Texas senior Chris Hercules finished second in the triple jump
and sophomore Moushaumi Robinson placed third in the 400 meters and helped
UT's 1,600-meter relay finish second at the 2001 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field
Championships in Eugene, Oregon in early June.
 The Texas women finished 10th in the team standings with 25 points,
extending their streak of top-10 finishes under head coach Beverly Kearney to
eight consecutive years.
The Longhorn men finished 15th with 19 points, marking the program's sixth
top-15 finish in head coach Bubba Thornton's six-year tenure.
In the meet's final event, Robinson anchored UT's 1,600-meter relay to a
runner-up finish for the second consecutive year in 3:30.36. She was joined
on the relay by freshman Alyssa Aiken, senior Angel Patterson and freshman
Raasin McIntosh.
Senior Nicole Hoxie and sophomore Jermaine Cooper both picked up their first
individual All-America honors in their respective hurdle events.
Hoxie closed her Longhorn career by finishing sixth in the 100-meter hurdles
in 13.08, marking her fourth All-America performance overall.
In the 110-meter hurdles, Cooper picked up his first All-America certificate
by finishing fourth in 13.97.
Sophomore Erin Sims picked up her first All-America honor by finishing
seventh in the 1,500-meter final. Sims ran 4:22.98.
Patterson finished third in the 400-meter hurdles in 56.45.
The Texas men scored in the 400-meter relay for the first time since 1988
with their seventh-place effort. The crew of junior Amar Johnson, senior
Lawrence Armstrong, junior Michael Franklin  and junior Nathanael Esprit ran
a 40.05.
Freshman Dylan Armstrong broke his school record and became the first
Longhorn ever to earn All-America honors in the hammer throw when he finished
fifth with a toss of 227-11, topping his prior record of 227-4 set at the
Clyde Littlefield Texas Relays on April 5. He now owns the top five throws in
school history.
Thornton and Kearney both say they expect their teams to be better next year.
Both say they are awaiting some signed letters of intent, but say they have
some recruits who will help their teams.
Thornton also has an outstanding transfer in Tre Gardner, a sprinter-long
jumper who started out at Baylor.

Basketball Star Evans Turns Pro

Junior Longhorns swingman Maurice Evans, 6-5, 220, has hired an agent, thus
forfeiting his senior year of college eligibility.
Evans  led the Horns in scoring last year with a 15.6 average.
He said he is ready to give the NBA a try.

Barnes Hires Top Recruiter

Longhorn basketball coach Rick Barnes has hired South Carolina assistant
coach Frank Haith, 35, as his top assistant.
Haith has a reputation as an outstanding recruiter.
Haith, who went with coach Dave Odom to South Carolina in April after
assisting Odom for the last four years at Wake Forest, takes the job vacated
by Rob Lanier, who resigned to become head coach at Siena College.
While at Wake Forest, Haith was instrumental in leading the Demon Deacons to
four consecutive post-season tournament appearances, including an NCAA bert
last season.
He also was instrumental in helping Wake Forest sign one of the nation's Top
10 recruiting classes during the 1999-2000 campaign.
""In Frank Haith, we have hired one of the top assistant coaches in the
nation,"" Barnes said.
""He came very highly recommended from many of the high school coaches in the
state of Texas and around the nation. Frank also brings a great deal of
familiarity with coaching and recruiting in this area of the country. There
is no question that it is just a matter of time before he becomes a head
coach at this level.""
Prior to joining the staff at Wake Forest, Haith served one year as the
associate head coach at Texas A&M (1996-97). He spent one season (1995-96) as
an assistant coach at Penn State, helping the Nittany Lions to a 21-7 overall
record.
But Barnes is still coach hunting because Ed Kohtala, who has been one of his
assistants  since he arrived at Texas three seasons ago, has been named head
coach at Alma College in Alma, Michigan. He is expected to name a replacement
in the next couple of weeks.

Assistant Golf Coach Named

UT head golf coach Susan Watkins has hired Shannon Fisher, a former TCU star,
as one of her assistant coaches
Fisher was a four-year letterwinner at TCU (1995-1999), where she led the
Horned Frogs to two appearances at the NCAA Championships in 1997 and 1999.
She is currently ranked 18th on TCU's Top 20 career scoring list with a
scoring average of 77.90 in 127 rounds played.
For the past year, Fisher, a native of Austin, has taught golf professionally
at the Austin Golf Club, where she served as the office manager and assistant
golf professional.
In 1999, she earned exempt status to compete on the SBC Futures Professional
Golf Tour.
""Shannon brings a new dynamic to our team,"" said Watkins, who led the
Longhorns to consecutive third-place showings at the last two NCAA
Championships. ""She is a great teacher of the game and has a strong knowledge
of the top players in Texas.""

Stephens Vying for Star Team

UT sophomore-to-be Stacy Stephens is one of 30 top players aged
19-and-younger competing at the USA Basketball Women's Junior National Team
Trials in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Following the four-day trials, which end Monday, 12 players will be selected
for the 2001 USA Women's Junior World Championship Team.
Stephens, a 6-1, center-forward, was the first Longhorn freshman in 20 years
- and only the second rookie ever - to lead the 20-13  Longhorn squad in
both scoring (11 ppg) and rebounding (9.4 rpg).
In Big 12 Conference action, she averaged 10.9 points and 10.3 rebounds per
league game and was one of only three league players to average a
double-double in both scoring and rebounding.
In addition to her All-Big 12 honors, Stephens was named to the 2000-01
Women's Basketball News Service National All-Freshman Second Team and was
tabbed the Big 12 Freshman of the Year by both the Dallas Morning News and
the Austin American Statesman.
RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns are having their elite summer camp this
weekend and Chelsi Welch, the 5-9 sharpshooter who led Plainview to the state
Class 4A championship last spring, says she plans to come to the camp. One of
the state's top underclass players, 6-3 Tiffany Jackson, a junior to be at
Dallas Lincoln, also says she will be there. Four out-of-state girls who
range from 6-3 to 6-4 1/2, also are scheduled to attend. UT's biggest need in
its next recruiting class is a shooting guard and a big center.

A ""Must Read"" For All UT Exes!
The Burnt Orange Coffin
(Los Muertos No Hablan)
By Bill Holchak  BJ '49
It's recruit signing day, and the greatest high school player in the history
of Texas football is scheduled to make his official commitment to play for
the Burnt Orange. But the expected celebration at the UT  Ex-Students Center
in Austin turns into a wake when it is learned that the boy and his father
have been found murdered at their remote ranch home near the
headwaters of the Frio and Nueces Rivers in south Texas. Millionaire
playboy/detective Bill Chak volunteers his services without charge to his
alma mater to solve the mystery, and finds out that the trail soon leads far
beyond the borders of the Lone Star State.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

812,"By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you 
with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very 
important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to 
gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their 
associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs 
real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and 
project costing are negatively impacted.
 
We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 
3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.  
Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Yvonne Laing, 
our site manager, on what you need to do before June 30th.  

Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry 
periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE)

813,"Rob, we may be saying the same thing here - for the EES outsourcing 
proposition (which is more than just asset management) as being defined by 
Rodney et al should be managed together by Industrial Origination and ECC.  
Although, I would agree that ECC should lead the sale process.  My view is 
that we should not and will not recreate the structuring, customer facing and 
execution requirements in Canada and Mexico required to do these deals. It is 
an important strategic iniative for ENA to complete a number of these deals. 
The problem is that a clear target list, joint accountabilities and schedule 
between the groups has not been rolled out which was discussed at Columbia 
Lakes.  All other industrial business other than P&P commodity/asset business 
is the perview of ECC.

Ultimately, I have not seen any outsourcing transactions from Canada in the 
deal structuring/due diligence queue.  The US group can help get these done 
and can help in the pitch.

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.


As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate 
Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on 
a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer 
another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply 
their name as soon as possible.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

and You keep on  blessing me.
Forgive me this day for everything I have done,
said or  thought that was not
pleasing to you. I ask now for Your  forgiveness.
Please keep me safe from all danger and harm.
Help me to  start this day
with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let
me make  the best of each
and every day to clear my mind so that I can hear
from  You.
Please broaden my mind that I can accept all
things. Let me not  whine and
whimper over things I have no control over. Let
me continue to  see sin
through God's eyes and acknowledge it as evil.
And when I sin,  let me
repent, and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing,
and receive the  forgiveness
of God.
And when this world closes in on me, let  me
remember Jesus' example - to
slip away and find a quiet place to  pray. It's
the best response when I'm
pushed beyond my limits. I know  that when I can't
pray, You listen to my heart. Continue to use me to  do
Your will.?Continue to bless me that I may
be a blessing to  others.
Keep me strong that I may help the weak. Keep me
uplifted  that I may have
words of encouragement for others. I pray for
those that  are lost and can't
find their way.
 I pray for those that are  misjudged and
misunderstood. I pray for those who
don't know You  intimately. I pray for those that
will delete this without
sharing it  with others. I pray for those that
don't believe. But I thank
you that I  believe.
I believe that God changes people and God changes
things. I  pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each
and every  family member in their households.
I pray for peace, love and joy in  their homes
that they are out of debt and all their needs are  met.
I pray that every eye that reads this knows there
is no  problem, circumstance, or situation greater than God.
Every battle is  in Your hands for You to fight. I pray that
these words  be received into the hearts of every eye that sees
them and every  mouth that confesses them willingly.
This is my prayer.
In  Jesus' Name, Amen.

Attached is our report for WTG 79 which answers the questions posed by 
Eickoff.  Please note that we provided more information than we were asked 
for in anticipation of additional questions from them, yourself and 
engineering.  In the attached report we have provided graphs which cover the 
previous month (versus the previous week), the production since commissioning 
(through February), and a fault list.

The gaps in the data occur wherever the SCADA system did not record data or 
it was corrupted in some way.  Please note the fault data is particularly 
susceptible to data integrity problems but it does appear that we had pretty 
good data recovery during this period.

In the graph section we included a graph of Gen rpm/rotor rpm which should 
yield the gearbox gear ratio (a constant).  However, interestingly enough the 
values fluctuated from time to time which we cannot explain.

We will have Trent Mesa WTG #30 for you tomorrow morning.

",,Ward Clear Sky Data Analysis
967,"Kurt, 
We changed from the Feb. curtailment format to the new format because 
curtailments are being recorded more accurately now.  Take this example of a 
typical curtailment: CPS requests that we keep each line at 30MW.  With the 
old format, we would enter one line of information that contained all of the 
turbines that were shut down.  This would work IF the same exact turbines 
were shut down for the duration of the curtailment.  This is never the case.  
To maintain a specific output (which is always what CPS requests) we are 
constantly shutting down and starting turbines due to windspeed fluctuation.  
Using the old format, there would be a new line entered every time another 
turbine was shut down or restarted.  This would also imply (inaccurately) 
that all the turbines affected by the curtailment were stopped and started 
each time a new turbine was added.  

With the new format, when we start or stop a turbine we just add another 
line.  This is the better method of the two to accurately record the down 
time, because it is itemized.  If the operators follow the procedure that has 
been given to them, this will be very accurate.  I apologize for the 
confusion over some of the information on the first March Log.  We have gone 
over the procedure again with all onsite personnel so we should not see the 
discrepancies again that we saw in March.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please give me a call.  Also, if 
you give me your fax#, I can fax you an original copy of the curtailment form 
so you can see first hand how the information is recorded.

Thank you
Matt

969,"For clarification, the ""Vestas availability"" you talk about is not specific 
to Vestas nor is it based on any Vestas contractual availability.   This 
availability is a multi- industry standard for simple ""series component"" 
availability.   There is no credit for maintenance or repair time time which 
is why a 3-5% loss is considered acceptable for long term performance.   The 
3-5% loss includes maintenance.   An availability metric that shows the 
turbine as available during repairs would be very objectionable to future 
owners.    Pausing the turbine during maintenance may be acceptable if the 
long term goal is set accordingly.   For example, if the turbine is always 
paused during maintenance then the long term system goal should be close to 
the 99.5% goal for grid availability.

Thank you for the referral of the Citizens Kingman, Arizona project to Enron 
Asset Management Resources (EAMR), the new ETS service company, for further 
development.  We appreciate your willingness to ""stay in the loop"" with the 
project since you have the relationship with the customer.  

It is not often that we have the opportunity to take over the operation of a 
facility before in-service.  This is a great opportunity to operate assets 
that do not have a long and potentially risky environmental history, so we 
are excited about this opportunity.

This bid proposal is envisioned to be a joint effort between Operations and 
Market Services to:
Identify the functions required to perform the requested services
Price the delivered services
Identify the risks associated with performing the services 
Mitigate and/or price in adequate compensation for the risks

As the project is kicked off, we enter the information gathering stage to 
determine the configuration of the facility and the service requirements.
I have placed a call to Citizens to initiate this effort and will keep you 
informed of developments.

I am assuming that Donna Scott will be the primary contact for this joint 
development and that she will coordinate Market Service's efforts, therefore,

concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, 
including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board.  
I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline 
or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit 
turbines.   Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron 
or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with 
money, turbines, etc.   If Enron does eventually decide to get into this 
deal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be

Constellation to Buy Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plants; Match for Entergy
in New York
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Constellation Nuclear, a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy,
and the owners of the two Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants announced
that Constellation Nuclear will buy 100 percent of Unit 1 and 82 percent
of Unit 2. Constellation will own a total of 1,550 MW of Nine Mile Point's
1,757 MW of total generating capacity. The total purchase price, including
fuel, is $815 million. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclea=
r
Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the New York Public Utilities Commission
still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase, but Constellation
Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid-2001.

ANALYSIS: This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever=
al
reasons. First, the purchase of the plants expands Constellation's generati=
on
assets, which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the
last year. Secondly, the location of the plants is a critical factor.=20
Constellation
has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region, and New
York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing
field for nuclear assets. Third, owning the Nine Mile Point plants will
elevate Constellation's stature, moving it ever close to become on par
with its nearest competitor in the New York market, Entergy Corp.

Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move
for Constellation Nuclear, let me establish some of the important factors
of the deal. Nine Mile Point is a two-unit boiling water reactor site.
Nine Mile 1 began producing electricity in 1969; Nine Mile 2 began producin=
g
electricity in 1988. The two units are both located in Scriba, N.Y., which
is about 40 miles north of Syracuse. The Nine Mile Point units have had
rather spotty histories, but over the last two years have shown signs of
becoming strong performers. Niagara Mohawk operates both units.

Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several
different utility owners. Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of
Unit 1. Unit 2 is owned by a group of co-owners: Niagara Mohawk (41 percent=
),
New York State Electric & Gas (18 percent), Rochester Gas & Electric=20
Corporation
(14 percent), and Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation (9 percent).
It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase
82 percent of Unit 2 because the Long Island Power Authority, an additional
co-owner that controls 18 percent of Unit 2, has opted not to sell its
share of the plant at this time.

The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service
Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market
value of their plants through an open, competitive process. This is part
of an overall effort to separate generation, transmission and distribution
activities within the state.

With that established, I will continue to support my case that the acquisit=
ion
of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energy's
growth strategy. In early 2000, Constellation began a restructuring of
its corporate identity, dividing its operations into two separate segments:
one focused on its merchant energy business (including Constellation Nuclea=
r)
and the other focused on regional retail energy services. The merchant
energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power
in the third quarter of 2000, and the company is committed to expanding
this growth. The goal for the merchant energy business, according to=20
Constellation
Energy CEO Christian Poindexter, is to establish a portfolio of over 30,000
MW of electric generation facilities by 2005. Toward that end, Constellatio=
n
Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage
of ""bargain prices for nuclear plants,"" which resulted in large part from
other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing,
or being mandated, to divest their generation plants.

Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group,
a unit within Constellation Nuclear, was established when Baltimore Gas
& Electric, another Constellation Energy subsidiary, created a new area
for its life-cycle license renewal activities. Thus, most likely Constellat=
ion
will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units,
and has a core group of people with expertise in this area. License renewal=
s
in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC, so there shoul=
d
not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process. The
only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe=
nt
in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC.

Presently, Constellation's generation assets are based in a mixture of
coal and nuclear. The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making
expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset, an 850-MW two-unit nuclear plant
in Southern Maryland. As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the
foreseeable future, buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and
nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases. Thus, Constellation could
be in a prime position if the desire for nuclear-generated power continues
to rise, as the company anticipates. While Constellation will most likely
retain its coal-fired generation assets, the company is clearly moving
closer toward a nuclear-based portfolio. Constellation has justified its
move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear
fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that ""the economics [of
nuclear] are quite robust, once they are calculated out.""

A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea=
ses
is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a 10-year contract to provide
electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices. Specific terms
of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of its
share of the Nine Mile Point plants' output back to the sellers at an avera=
ge
price of nearly $35/MWh until 2010. This alone should provide a solid rate
of return for Constellation's merchant energy business.

In addition, as I indicated, the New York location is key factor in this
deal. Aside from its large population, the state of New York is home to
a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently. For these
two reasons alone, New York stands out as the center within Constellation's
focus on the Northeastern United States. Yet, Constellation's competitors
also have the same plan, and have all fought to gain assets in the region.


Just within the last few months, Entergy Corp.=01*which also has based its
strategy to a large extent on nuclear=01*has been aggressively making its
own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State. In fact, Entergy
was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders
for the Nine Mile Point plants. I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor=
d,
an Entergy spokesperson, back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was
actively attempting to purchase the two plants. However, despite the loss
of the two Nine Mile Point plants, Entergy retains a very strong nuclear
presence in New York. In late November, Entergy closed the sale on the
New York Power Authority's two nuclear power plants, Indian Point Unit
3 in Westchester County and the James A. Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County=
.
In fact, the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest=20
acquisition
to date in Entergy's nuclear strategy, and also represented the highest
purchase price ($967 million) ever of a nuclear asset. Earlier in the same
month, Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point 2 plant from Con
Edison. Altogether, Entergy now controls over 3,000 MW of nuclear generatio=
n
in the state of New York.

Consequently, since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of
the top nuclear power producers in the industry, it will need to match
Entergy (along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke) with regard
to its nuclear portfolio. There is only a limited number of nuclear plants
that will become available for purchase, and thus any acquisition of an
operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in
this particular market.

As a sidenote, I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary
sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants (100 percent of Unit 1 and 41 percent
of Unit 2). It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir=
ed
by National Grid, a U.K. company that is considered one of the world's
largest independent transmission companies. The acquisition of Niagara
Mohawk is supporting National Grid's strategy of becoming a major presence
in the transmission and distribution sectors of the U.S. energy industry.
Generation is not a high priority for National Grid, and the sale of Niagar=
a
Mohawk's nuclear assets resulted from this strategy.

Moreover, once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches
that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States.
Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawk's current strategy,
it is a key component for Constellation Energy. There are certainly risks
associated with both approaches, but the bottom line on this deal, from
my perspective, is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets
in a strong market. It's pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be
a contender in the nuclear arena, especially in New York, and owning the
two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal.

      ,Copyright 2000 EEI. All rights reserved.

EEI's State Restructuring Service is proud to present an Internet E-Forum 
providing an overview of the North American Electric Reliability Council's 
(NERC) recently released Reliability Assessment 2000-2009, the reliability of 
bulk electric systems in North America.

The reliability of the electric generation and transmission systems serving 
North America has come under increased federal government, state regulator, 
and customer scrutiny. Generation capacity margins have decreased and the 
bulk electric systems are subjected to flows in magnitudes and directions not 
contemplated when they were designed or for which there is minimal operating 
experience.

Each year, the Reliability Assessment Subcommittee (RAS) of the North 
American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reviews the overall reliability 
of existing and planned electric generation and transmission systems in North 
America. This year's Reliability Assessment 2000-2009 report presents:

*An assessment of electric generation and transmission reliability through 
2009

*An assessment of the generation resource adequacy of each Interconnection in 
North America

*A discussion of key issues affecting reliability of future electric supply

*Regional assessments of electric supply reliability, including issues of 
specific Regional concern

Presenting an overview of this year's Reliability Assessment is Frank J. 
Koza, Jr., Chairman, Reliability Assessment Subcommittee, and General 
Manager, Ventures, PECO Energy Company.

Our guest moderator is Tim Gallagher, Mgr Technical Services, NERC

1011,"One additional point.  If we aren't going to try to rebut the ""funny money"" 
argument on the merits, can we at least have Leslie Lawner or someone loaded 
up to dispute their circumstantial case?  Both Amoco and Dynegy argue that 
marketing affiliates hold a much higher percentage of the capacity on their 
sister pipelines than they do on non-affiliated pipes.  They argue that 
unfairness or abuse can be inferred from that fact alone.  The Enron pipes 
may be a statistical oddity on this.  A very small percentage of NN and TW 
capacity has been held by affiliates.  I think the same is true on Border and 
to a lesser extent on Florida.  Amoco and Dynegy can't have it both ways.  If 
they want to infer abuse from a large percentage of a pipe's capacity being 
held by marketing affiliates (i.e., El Paso) then they also have to infer an 
absence of abuse from a small percentage (i.e., the Enron pipes).  Can we 
argue this???  DF

clumsy.  Bay, my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due around

1019,"On Thursday last week the Commission eliminated the old ""Texas Eastern"" rule 
that required pipelines to obtain prior FERC approval before contracting for 
transportation and storage capacity on upstream or downstream pipelines.  The 
new rule allows pipelines to acquire and use such capacity without going to 
FERC first.  The rule does reiterate that bundled sales of gas are still 
prohibited, and further provides that the acquiring pipeline will be 
financially at risk for the costs of the acquired capacity.  Interestingly, 
the acquiring pipeline apparently has the option of selling the acquired 
capacity under its own rate schedules or of releasing the capacity pursuant 
to its capacity release program.  The order is silent on whether the price 
cap applies to short term releases of acquired capacity.   While we are still 
reviewing the order and may provide additional guidance at  a later time, I'd 
emphasize for now that our normal contract approval procedures and authority 
thresholds should be deemed to apply to capacity contracts.   For example, 
the ""Approval Authorization for Cash Expenditures"" dated Feb. 3, 2000

1034,"MidAm advised us they intend to call the enforcement hotline, probably today, 
to get enforcement staff involved in resolving the Carlton timing problem 
(i.e., the absence of an order approving or not approving the settlement).  
If Midam does so, Enforcement will then contact Northern for a 
response--probably Dari or MKM or I, but who knows who they'll call.
If they do, the following bullets are important to convey as our preliminary 
response to MidAm:

1.  Midam, and all of our customers, are aware that a Commission order on the 
June 2, 2000 Settlement is necessary before the precise flow obligation for 
this Nov-March period can be determined.  The flow obligation for sourcers 
like MidAm will be slightly higher--by about 3%--if the settlement is 
approved.  For all customers that have asked what the precise flow obligation 
numbers would be under the two scenarios, settlement approval or settlement 
non-approval, we have given that information.  We gave that information to 
MidAm also.  We can't file the tariff sheets setting out the specific number 
for this heating season until the Commission addresses the settlement.

2.  The true financial impact of the current uncertainty on MidAm is 
minimal.  We believe many of the sourcers have locked in their supply based 
on the lower flow obligation number, but with an option to increase their 
purchase quantity if the Commission approves the settlement.  MidAm may have 
done that, but we don't know.  If not, and if the Commission approves the 
Settlement, their only real ""cost"" would arise if they have to buy the 
additional flow obligation volume--about 1100 MMBtu/d for MidAm--now at a 
higher price than they would have paid if they bought it earlier when they 
locked up the bulk of their flow obligation supply.    Given the large drop 
in gas prices the last several days, there may not be any increased cost.   

3.  The bottom line is that we really need an order on the Settlement.  The 
majority of Northern's customers support it as a fair solution to the Carlton 
problem.  MidAm is the only opponent that has raised substantive issues.  
MidAm is clinging to a financial windfall it gets under the old Carlton 
mechanism and has no reason to oppose the settlement other than preserving 
that windfall.    


That's the end of the proposed script.  The last bullet may go to far, but I 
like it.  Frank and Steve, MKM suggested that you guys get Doering and Gorak 
and others to call FERC (hotline or otherwise--I don't think it matters) and 
express their concern that the order is not on the agenda.  DF  ","Carlton Midam Dari MKM Frank Steve Doering Gorak

I just ran several Shipper Scheduled Quanties reports and discovered the fomat had changed.  

I monitor several contracts for forecasting purposes and also provide Market Services invoicing 
information for revenues for negotiated rates and sharing revenues for volumes flowing West for USGT. 
I rely upon the Shipper Scheduled Quantities report to get the information I need.  Before the change, 
I was able to run 1 report for each of these shippers each week, a total of 3 reports.  Because the new 
report does not give me month-to-date totals I now have to run a report for each shipper for each gas day, 
a total of 21 reports each week.  It is very time consuming to run and analyze all these reports.  As 
Marketing does more of these sort of deals the volume will only grow. 

It is critical that I get a report that gives me month-to-date totals so I don't have to run a report for each shipper
for each day.  Is there some way you could revise the report to again show the month-to-date totals?

Minor comparisons:

1)  The 2nd portion of the original report had an area where you could quickly glance at either your receipt
           or delivery point totals.  In order to get a break out of receipt and delivery points now, you have to run 1 
           report sorted by receipt point and 1 report by delivery point.

2)	This is very minor, but I also liked the fact that the report was on letter size paper.  All my files have 
            been set up to accomodate that size of report.  I now have to set up new files.


I appreciate any help you can give me in this matter.

1085,"Following up from my earlier e-mail regarding the primary receipt capacity on 
the CNG FT contract associated with the Cove Point gas;
CNG has indicated that on a peak day they would restrict  the PL1 system to 
primary receipts and deliveries consequently eliminating the WGL redelivery 
option that VNG has utilised in the past several years to deliver the Cove 
Point gas via CNG.  I called Williams to ask if the Cove Point gas that ENA 
has this winter could deliver into CNG, the answer was clearly not until 
April 2002 due to a pressure problem on the Cove Point side.  
I think the emphasis should shift to AGL to pressure TRANSCO to fulfil their 
contractual arrangement or at least provide a financial settlement.
Let me know if I can help in any way.",Williams,,CNG WGL VNG TRANSCO
1086,"I met with Jeff Kiester of DTI yesterday regarding the storage offering they 
have on the market.  They have 3 Bcf storage capacity and 30,000dt/d of 
FT-GSS up for bid by 2/12/01. However there will be up to an additional 10 
Bcf of storage capcity available before 4/1/01 depending on additional 
turnback.  All of this capacity is utility turnback mainly, East Ohio, 
National Fuel and RG&E.
Potential uses for DTI storage:
1.  Desk use - If we buy the storage without the transportation we would 
inject and withdraw at SP.  If we do submit a bid, I would recommend that we 
try to incorporate free intramonth injection capability, effectivly giving us 
a no-notice type service that we could use to take physical positions in the 
cash market.  The current park/loan rate is $0.07 /dt/d, it seems we utilize 
this 2-3 times a month.
2.  VNG - AGL could want to look into adding storage to the VNG portfolio,  
the drawback is that the PL1 line has no excess deliverability, VNG's need is 
more a peak day issue.
3.  Partner with EES - Paul Tate from EES also sat in on our meeting, he 
expressed an interest in looking into potential partnering oppourtunities 
with the East desk regarding markets on TCO and DTI.  This storage offering 
for example could be something we partner on.  I plan to meet with Paul at 
the beggining of next week to discuss further (Dick I will check with you on 
your availability).

Jeff also indicated there will be more transportation capacity turned back in 
the near future.  There will be a posting for 75,000 dt/d of Lebanon - Leidy 
capacity coming out in the next few weeks.  

Market view on capacity release:
With the utilities turning back transportation, the economics of the capacity 
release market will change.  The utilities have historically released 
transportation in the summer months for $0.05 or less (as low as $0.01) in 
order to recover something from their asset.  DTI will now be the marketer of 
the turned back capacity.  Historically the pipeline has been very reluctant 
to sell capacity below max rate in the winter and less than 50% ($0.12 at 
current rates) in the summer.   Jeff indicated that his view is that capacity 
values will increase slighly this summer and significantly next summer due to 
the new power gen load coming online 2002.  As part of DTI's last rate case 
settlement FT-GSS holders can no longer release transportation in the summer, 
that went into effect last summer-00.  Although the capacity release market 
was a little tighter last summer it did not significantly drive up capacity 
release prices in the summer-00.  My view is that two of the three power gen 
loads will be interuptible and therfore will not sigificantly increase the 
overall load factor of the system.  The bottom line is that DTI is competing 
with capacity release and I feel there will be enough capacity release 
available on the market this summer to force DTI to sell it's capacity below 
50% of max rate.  However capacity release prices may increase next year as 
more utilities turnback capacity and the new power generation may be in the 
capacity release market.

Market View on Basis on CNG for Summer 01 & Summer 02:
With the increased load and potentially low storage inventory level going 
into this summer, basis could be strong vs historical prices. However, with 
the inception of M&NEP delivering 400,000dt/d into the Northeast last year 
CNG basis (summer strip) was less than $0.20 in Jan-00 and Feb-00,  even 
though the April 1 storage inventory level was the lowest since 1996.  In 
1996 CNG Apr-Oct strip traded as high as high as $0.31 in Feb-96 and dropped 
as low as $0.21 by May-96.  DTI summer load is averages 2.5 - 3.0 Bcf, I 
don't think the 100,000dt/d load of the new power gen load will be 
significant this summer considering the additional supply coming in from 
Dracut.   However with American National Power Inc (34,000Dth/d) and El Paso 
Gas Services Co (139,000dt/d) both coming online in 2001, that have 
contracted for around half of the Dracut supply, this may cause sumer basis 
prices to increase from current levels (Apr-01-Oct-01 strip $0.33) this 
summer and depending on storage inventories 4/1/02,  Apr-Oct-02 basis may be 
also get stronger.

1091,"The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 8/1and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.

1101,"My preference is to resolve the NBPL issues.  Enron-Canada still needs some of the NBPL capacity permanently released to one of their producers with a another third-party designated as the agent for the contract.  Oxy and some other folks have approached me about picking up some of the ENA space.  

Please note that we were trying to get the transportation protocols approved by the Creditors Committee so that we could address (1) NBPL's insistence that the Creditor's approve everything and (2) the needs of the marketplace that once the capacity is awarded that it could be hedged without any additional Creditor approval.  I know that we are making progress on the drafts, but how quickly do you envision this issues being presented to the Creditor's Committee?

NBPL wants the capacity placed with new shippers for June 2002 business.  Ideally, this means that the new shippers should have the capacity released to them by Friday, May 24th.  This means that the capacity would have to be posted on NBPL's website by the morning of May 20th.  The schedule also assumes that the capacity release process is not stopped once it starts for Creditor's approval.

Kay, would it be OK if I called Eva and got a quick download on the results of the Tenaska complaint against NBPL that was filed with the FERC enforcement division?  Do I need to have a lawyer listen in when I make the call?

1102,"This is NBPL's response to my suggestion that we need NBPL's input on the ""Transportation Rejection/Acceptance Master Plan"" for NBPL's pipeline that we are trying to get Creditor Committee approval.  I view NBPL's protocol a process that the Creditor's could agree to prior to starting the automatic capacity release process.  I suggested this overall approach in response as an alternative to NBPL notification that they are preparing a draft Motion compelling us to take action under procedures of the Bankruptcy Court  

Although there is a few differences proposed by NBPL, overall it seems reasonable.  We would need to work out a few details, including clarifying how to handle the Burchill capacity that involves Enron Canada's settlement.

I would like to contact Eva Neufield at NBPL to clarify the Burchill issues.  Unfortunately, the Burchill capacity is a portion of the capacity included in Tenaska's FERC complaint filing.  Legally, can or should I make any other contacts with NBPL until the FERC issues are addressed internally in more detail?

Please order Chris a power strip. I was not able to power on his PC because he did not have a free outlet.

Please call the Resolution Center (3-1411) to request IDF 6F4A-B be activated. I would have done this myself, but the Network Team is now requiring a Co. and RC #.

One more thing, Chris is requesting Monitor Arms. If you do order them for him, he will need two sets of Vertical Arms. These Arms can be ordered via e-mail from Reggie Wilson.

Chris,

As soon as the power strip comes in and the port is activated I can come by and complete the install.

Columbia Gulf Transmission (CGT) will be performing a line lowering project on 
a portion of its East Lateral Line 300 beginning on June 24, 2002.  This 
project is expected to take seven days to complete.

The only location to be impacted by this project is 4119 - AEP/Equitable 
Storage.  This location is impacted because it is solely connected to Line 300. 
 While this work is being performed, CGT will be unable to accept nominations 
for delivery to or receipt from this location.

A revised notice will be posted once the work has been completed and CGT is 
able to resume accepting nominations for this location.",,,COLUMBIA GULF TRANSMISSION COMPANY Columbia Gulf Transmission CGT

Keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by UBS so be careful in completing this form.   In addition, UBS has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking P&L.    The ""liquidity reserve"" accounts for the fact you can't liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can't even liquidate at the bid (offer).

NGI-PGE/TOPOCK is an internal curve used to value transport and is equal to 
NGI-SOCAL.  This curve will probably show up every month because the West 
Coast is very volitile.  The change is due to a change in the market.

IF-TW/PERMIAN is a production area curve.  The change is also due to  market

RE:
Amendments to NYMEX End of Week Post-Close Trading Session Rule

DATE:
May 4, 2001
===========================================================

Please be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of
changes to the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule that were
recently approved by the Board will become effective.

Specifically, beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001 and continuing for
subsequent Friday post-close sessions (and post-close sessions the day
before a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in
effect:

(1)  Contract months eligible for trading in these sessions will be
expanded from the first four to the first 12 consecutive listed contract
months.

(2)  The sessions will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.57(""POST-CLOSE TRADING SESSION"") AND
NYMEX RULE 6.57A (""END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION"")

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

Rule 6.57A.     END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION

On the last trading day of the calendar week, and, in any week when an
Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading
day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close
trading session provided on the trading floor pursuant to Rule 6.57.
Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the ""End of Week
Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and
subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or
the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week
Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in
all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of [ten (10)]  * five
(5) * minutes in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the
following conditions:

(A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first
[four] * twelve * listed delivery months;

(B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular
contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and
competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable
contract month for that futures contract * and as further expanded above
the daily high and below the daily low only for the contracts listed below
provided however that no such expanded trading range may exceed the price
fluctuation limits in effect for the applicable contract as of the end of
the RTH session:

Contract                 Additional Ticks

Crude Oil                20 ticks
Natural Gas                   50 ticks
Unleaded Gasoline             50 ticks
Heating Oil                   50 ticks *

(C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their
customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during
the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH
session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders,
limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have
expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.
Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired
order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be
submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be
reported on public ticker services;

(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week
Session shall not be considered in determining any settlement price; and

(F) Floor Members executing trades during the End of Week Session shall
mark a line across their trading cards prior to the entry of an End of Week
Session trade.

_____________________________________________________________________

June Nasdaq futures weaker today. Prices are trading sideways but are
still within striking distance of the April high of 1995. Sideways
trading the past week has negated a fledgling four-week-old uptrend
on the daily bar chart. Bulls still have some heavy lifting to do and
their next upside objective is resistance at the key 2,000 area.
First support is seen at the 1,732 area.

June S&P 500 futures closed firmer today. Prices have leveled off the
past week, after rallying solidly off the early-April low.
Technically, bulls still need to push prices above the 1285
resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in the stock
market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a slower grind
higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen at 1285.00.
First support is seen at 1206.00.

LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed $0.28 higher at 70.25 today.
Prices scored a consolidative ""inside"" day on the daily bar chart
today. On Wednesday, prices gapped sharply lower and hit a fresh
eight-month low. Reports that cash cattle traded $1.00 lower this
week sent the futures market tumbling. The June futures are still
overextended on the downside, technically, on a short-term basis. The
bears are in full control of the market. Prices are trading way below
an accelerating two-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart.
Next support, basis June, is seen at $69.82--Wednesday's low. First
resistance comes in at the $70.50 level.

August feeder cattle closed up 53 cents today at $80.00. Prices also
posted a corrective rebound after the sharp losses Wednesday. Recent
history continues to play out, as the market bounced up from the
losses of the past two days. But if prices break down below the
bottom of the recent trading range, which is right at Wednesday's low
of $87.40, then the door is opened to a lower trend down to the
January low just above the $86.00 level. Next resistance is seen at
$88.30. First support is seen at $87.40.

June lean hogs closed firmer today. The bears still have the momentum
on their side at present. Next support lies at $67.00--today's low.
First resistance is located at the 69.00 level.

GRAINS: July corn futures closed 6 3/4 cents lower at $1.98 1/4
today. A bearish USDA report indicating large carryover stocks of
corn pushed prices lower today. Prices closed near the session low,
after gapping sharply lower on the daily bar chart. Prices were under
pressure earlier this week after weekly crop progress reports showed
good corn-planting progress in the U.S. The past 25 years of chart
history shows nearby corn futures prices do not stay below $2.00 very
long. However, the shorter-term technicals are very bearish at
present, and would-be bottom pickers don't want to stand in front of
a freight train. Next support is now seen at $1.95. Next resistance
is seen at today's high of $2.03.

July soybeans closed 4 1/2 cents lower at $4.35 today. Prices closed
near the session low amid a bearish USDA report released this
morning. The bearish report did put pressure on the market, but not
the strong pressure corn saw. Traders have factored much of the
bearish news into the soybean market. Odds are lessening that a minor
bull flag could be forming on the daily bar chart. Bears still have
the solid advantage. Fundamentally, there is not much in the way of
good news for bulls right now. I would not be surprised to see the
commodity funds make another downside push in beans in the near term.
It's going to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer
to force prices solidly higher. First resistance is seen at the $4.45
area and then $4.50. First support is seen at $4.30.

July soybean meal closed off $1.80 at $154.50 today. Prices did not
put in that bad of a performance today, given the bearish USDA
report. Prices this week are consolidating after they pushed to a
fresh eight-week high last Friday. Recent price action is still
encouraging to the bulls and is one sign the lows are in place in the
meal market. Next resistance comes in at the $158.50 area. First
support is seen at $154.00.

July bean oil closed 6 points lower at 14.77 cents today. Prices
scored a fresh contract low today of 14.75 cents. Oil is technically
weaker than beans or meal right now. But I would be surprised if
there is much downside left in oil. Next resistance comes in at 15.00
cents. Next support is seen at 14.50 cents.

July Chicago wheat closed 2 3/4 cents higher at $2.68 1/2 today. A
bullish USDA report boosted wheat higher, but prices did back off
from the highs and close near the session low, due mostly to the
weakness in corn and soybeans. Prices just Wednesday touched the
contract low of $2.65. If prices can post a strong bounce in the next
couple sessions, a double-bottom reversal pattern could be forming on
the daily bar chart. Bears are in command. Serious technical damage
has occurred the past few sessions. First support lies at the
contract low of $2.65. Next resistance is seen at $2.73--today's
high.

K.C. July HRW wheat closed up 5 cents at $3.27 1/4 today. A bullish
USDA wheat production figure today boosted HRW. Prices gapped higher
on the daily bar chart, but backed well off the highs by the close.
It will be important for bulls to show some follow-through strength
on Friday. Serious chart damage has been inflicted the past few
sessions and bears still rule. For bulls to get back in the ballgame,
they need to push prices north and fill the downside gap on the daily
bar chart (created last week) by pushing prices to the $3.34 area.
That's a tall order right now. Next resistance is seen at the $3.31
level-- today's high. Next support is seen at $3.21 1/2.

SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 6 points higher at 9.06 cents today. We
now could see a minor bullish pennant forming in sugar, on the daily
bar chart. This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains.
A three-month high was scored in July sugar late last week. The bulls
have good momentum and a steep and accelerating six-week-old uptrend
line is still in place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now
comes in at 9.25 cents. First support is now seen at 8.80 cents.

July N.Y. coffee closed 65 points higher at 68.55 cents today. Prices
closed near the session high. The bulls have gained momentum of late.
This recent upmove is the most significant showing by the bulls since
mid-January. The fact that prices have not sold off sharply the past
few sessions is encouraging for the bulls, too--given recent price
history. Still, the bears could be setting a trap, like they did in
early January. If bulls can push prices above 70 cents and then see
follow-through strength, bears will begin to think this uptrend is
sustainable. First resistance comes in at 70 cents. First support is
seen 65.00 cents.

July N.Y. cocoa closed $28 higher today, at $1,050. Prices today
matched the six-week high scored yesterday, and finished close to the
session high. Tuesday's strong gap-higher trade on the daily bar
chart put the bulls back on a level playing field with the bears. If
prices can push higher Friday, bulls will have the edge. Prices this
week pushed above and negated a 2.5-month-old downtrend line on the
daily bar chart. Next resistance comes in at $1,060. First support is
now seen at $1,025.

July cotton closed 60 points lower at 44.83 cents today. Prices
scored a new contract low in the wake of a bearish USDA report.
However, most traders did expect the bearish figures in the
report--namely high carryover stocks. Cotton is presently in a strong
bear market. Right now, any rebounds are likely to be just selling
opportunities for the bears. But, my bias is still that we are not
that far from a bottoming process. Next support lies at 44.00 cents.
First resistance is seen around 47.00 cents. Would-be bottom-pickers
should beware.

July orange juice futures closed 80 points higher today, at 79.50
cents. Prices closed near the session high again today after
Wednesday pushing higher and filling an important downside gap area
on the daily bar chart. Today's USDA report was termed mostly neutral
by the trade. Bulls are gaining confidence after the past two days'
action. Next resistance is now seen at 80.00 cents. Next support
comes in at 78.00 cents.

METALS: June COMEX gold closed off $0.90 today, at $269.50. Prices
corrected a bit today after Wednesday's strong gains that pushed
prices to a two-month high. This market is in a nice uptrend since
scoring its early-April low. This week's type of price action is what
bulls needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart.
Next resistance is located at $273. First support is seen at $268.00.

July silver closed down $0.065 today, at $4.35 an ounce. Prices sold
off sharply today after rallying sharply Wednesday. This should not
surprise many. Silver prices are still not that far above the
contract low. Prices are chopping at lower levels, and this suggests
a ""basing"" action that many markets need to change the trend from
down, to sideways, to eventually up. Next support is seen at $4.30.
First resistance is seen at $4.425. Bears still have the advantage.

July N.Y. copper closed 40 points lower today, at 75.95 cents. Prices
today matched the contract low scored in early April. The stock
market and the U.S. economy will have to be healthy before the bulls
can really get something going in copper. Next resistance is seen at
77.00 cents. Next support is seen at 75.00 cents.

ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.12 higher at $29.06 today. Prices
closed well off the high of $29.43. Bulls and bears are still at a
stand-off, but bull will gain the edge on a move above $29.50. Expect
more choppy trading. Next support is seen at 28.00. Next resistance
lies at $29.50.

July heating oil closed 5 points higher today, at .7715. Bulls still
have the slight edge. Look for more choppy trading in the near
future. Next support is seen at 75.00 cents. Next resistance is seen
at 79.00 cents.

July unleaded gasoline closed 29 points lower at 1.0040 today. Prices
scored a new contract high just Monday. Bulls are still in command as
peak driving season nears. Top-pickers beware! Next resistance is
seen at $1.03. First support is seen at $.9780.

July natural gas closed 13.7 cents higher at $4.41 today. After,
prices hit a fresh five-and-one-half-month Wednesday, we saw a
corrective bounce today. Next support is seen at $4.20 and first
resistance is at $4.50. This market is still short-term oversold,
technically.

FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 32 points lower
at .8812 today. Prices scored a bearish ""outside day"" down today and
pushed to a fresh four-week low. Bears have the edge. The European
Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates today, which initially boosted
the Euro, but those gains were short-lived. My bias is still that
there is not much downside left in the Euro. Look for more choppy
action in the near term. Next support is now seen at .8750. Next
resistance is seen at .8900.

The June Japanese yen closed 33 points lower at .8190 today. Bears
are in control. Bulls are hoping for some ""basing"" activity at lower
levels, and that may be occurring, although it's too early to tell.
Next support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is seen at
the .8326 level.

The June Swiss franc closed 3 points lower at .5744. Bears are in
command as prices scored a bearish ""outside day"" down on the daily
bar chart today. Prices pushed to a fresh four-week low today. Still,
my bias is that prices won't deteriorate much more. Next support is
seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes in at the .5800
level.

The June Australian dollar futures closed unchanged at .5234 today.
Prices pushed to another fresh two-month high today. The bulls have
the advantage as a six-week-old uptrend line is in place on the daily
bar chart. First resistance is now seen at .5300. First support is
now seen at .5200.

The June Canadian dollar closed 20 points lower today, at .6478.
Monday's key reversal does not indicate prices are headed back toward
the lows seen a few weeks ago. What it does suggest is a downside
correction to the recent gains may occur over the near term. Bulls
still have the slight edge, on a short-term basis. This currency had
been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more
downside. Next resistance is seen at the .6548 level. First support
is seen at the .6450 level.

The June British pound closed 18 points higher at 1.4218. Trading
continues choppy at lower levels. This currency was not that far
above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more
downside in the sterling. One could argue that price action the past
few weeks has been a ""basing"" before prices eventually turn north. A
move above the 1.4500 level would be considered a bullish ""upside
breakout"" from the recent congestion area. A move below 1.4100 would
be considered a bearish downside breakout. Next support is now seen
at the 1.4160 level. Next resistance comes in at the 1.4300 level.

The June U.S. dollar index closed 30 points higher at 116.52 today.
Prices scored a bullish ""outside day"" up on the daily bar chart, and
pushed to a fresh four-week high. Bulls have the momentum in the near
term. Next resistance lies at the 117.00 level. First support is seen
at the 115.50 area. My bias is still that a near-term top is in place
in the dollar index, but if prices push above the 117.00 area in the
near term, odds increase that a new high will be scored.

June U.S. T-bonds closed 1 6/32 lower today at 101 1/32. Bulls today
lost most of the momentum they had gained last week. A surprise
interest rate cut by the European Central Bank pressured the U.S.
debt market. See more on the bond market in this evening's
newsletter. Next support is seen at 100 even--par. First resistance
is seen at 102 16/32 level.

The June U.S. T-note closed off 27.0 (32nds) today at 104.12.5. Bears
have the slight edge and prices scored a bearish ""outside day"" down
on the daily bar chart today. First support is seen at the 104.00.0
level. First resistance is seen at 105.10.5--today's high.

Just wanted to let you know that I have had 4 or 5 dispute requests which are 
actually a counterparty change.  They have been entered in EnPower as sales 
or purchases to/from TransCanada Power Corp. when the counterparty is 
actually TransCanada Power, a division of TransCanada Energy Ltd   (who 
really knows the difference?)  Anyway, just wanted to bring this to your 
attention so that the next time they call, you know how to record it in 
EnPower.  (Or at least you'll know to ask which TransCanada they are.)

NEWSFLASHES:

Better behave: You can be 'cuffed and taken to jail for not
wearing a seat belt, at least in Texas, Atwater v. Lago Vista, No.
99-1408 (U.S. Apr. 24, 2001), but our legislature is working on
the problem. See S.B. 112 & H.B. 363.

ERISA & Texas law: United States Supreme Court holds that
ERISA plan provisions prevailed when man received life
insurance policy and pension plan in divorce, died shortly post-
divorce, but never changed beneficiary designation of ex-wife with
plan's administrator. Washington State law that plan beneficiaries
are automatically revoked upon divorce preempted by federal
law. Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, No. 99-1529 (U.S. Mar. 21, 2001).
Compare Weaver v. Keen, No. 10-99-305-CV (Tex. App. -
Waco Apr. 18, 2001, n.p.h.) (order denying pet. reh.) (Vance,
J.) (rev'g & rem'g to County Court at Law No. 4, Dallas
County) (agrees with Egelhoff but reaches contrary result).

From the =01+Net: Did you hear about the terrorists who held the
entire ABA convention hostage?  They threatened to release one
lawyer per hour unless their demands were met.

Page One: Texas Procedure and Remedies

How final is final? A judgment is final if it says ""with unmistakable
clarity"" that it is final, or if the judgment actually disposes of all
claims and parties before the court.  A ""Mother Hubbard"" clause
""does not indicate finality."" Guajardo v. Conwell, 44 Tex. S. Ct.
J. 693 (Apr. 26, 2001) (per curiam) (concurring in result only)
(aff'g 30 S.W.3d 15 (Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.] 2000)
(per curiam) (granting motion to dismiss appeal)).

Unpleasant business: Mall manager told police lessee owned mall
store and threatened to file criminal trespass charges against
claimed purchaser, but did not act in extreme and outrageous
manner even though he did not give additional facts. Broad
dictum: ""Business managers must have latitude to exercise their
rights in a permissible way in order to properly manage their
business, even though it may not always be pleasant for those
involved."" Bradford v. Vento, 44 Tex. S. Ct. J. 655 (Apr. 26,
2001) (Abbott, J.) (aff'g, rev'g & ren'g 997 S.W.2d 713 (Tex.
App. - Corpus Christi 1999) (en banc) (Yanez, J.) (Seerden,
C.J., dissenting)) (aff'g, rev'g & ren'g 357th Judicial District
Court, Cameron County).

Discrimination causation: Texas Supreme Court adopts Texas
Labor Code's causation standard of ""a motivating factor"" in state-
law based employment discrimination suit. Court would have
followed Title VII standards but couldn't tell what they are
because federal courts ""are closely divided on the issue."" See
Texas Commission on Human Rights Act, Tex. Labor Code o
21.001 et seq.; cf. id. o  21.051 (""because of"" standard), with
id. o 21.125 (""a motivating factor"" standard). Quantum Chem.
Corp. v. Toennies, 44 Tex. S. Ct. J. 519 (Mar. 8, 2001) (Phillips,
C.J.) (Hecht, J., dissenting) (aff'g  998 S.W.2d 374 (Tex. App. -
Houston [1st Dist.] 1999) (Andell, J.) (rev'g & rem'g to 190th
Judicial District Court, Harris County)).

Admissions undeemed: Mandamus conditionally issued to trial
court to vacate order, after hearing within 30 days of trial, denying
motion to undeem ultimate-issue admissions when record showed
that party failed to respond because of law firm's accident or
mistake. No adequate remedy by appeal because relator's ability
to present viable claim or defense at trial vitiated or severely
compromised and no final, appealable judgment rendered
simultaneously. In Re: Kellogg-Brown & Root, Inc., No.
12-01-00116-CV (Tex. App. - Tyler May 8, 2001, orig.
proceeding) (Worthen, J.) (writ cond. granted).

Scope of remand: When a party contests liability in the trial court
but only damages on appeal, a reversal requires that both
damages and liability be retried because of Tex. R. App. P.
44.1(b), which says a court may not order a separate trial solely
on unliquidated damages if liability is contested, as by general
denial. Estrada v. Dillon, 44 Tex. S. Ct. J. 613 (Apr. 12, 2001)
(per curiam) (aff'g, rev'g & rem'g 23 S.W.3d 422 (Tex. App. -
Amarillo 2000) (Reavis, J.)) (rev'g & rem'g to 137th Judicial
District Court, Lubbock County, Shaver, J.).


Page Two: Texas Family Law

Frequent flyer miles: Trial court properly clarified divorce decree,
which awarded 200,000 Lufthansa frequent flyer miles to ex-wife,

California Update: Duke Energy Proposes Settlement Deal 

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE][IMAGE]Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) approached Calif. Gov. Gray Davis with 
a secret deal, now made public, that offered monetary concessions if the 
state drops lawsuits and investigations into the company's alleged price 
gouging. Duke made the offer in a secret 17-page letter sent in April to Gov. 
Davis' office, which the governor confirmed on May 2. Davis' spokesman called 
the letter Duke's ""wish list,"" which included having the state call off 
investigations of the North Carolina-based generator. Although Gov. Davis has 
acknowledged receipt of the proposal, he has not officially accepted or 
rejected the offer. 

Analysis: Duke's desire to make a settlement with the state of California 
stems from an ongoing investigation by FERC that began back in March. At that 
time, FERC put 13 California power sellers, including Duke, on notice that 
they must either make refunds for certain power sales or provide further 
justification for their prices. Duke is considered to be one of four 
companies (along with Dynegy, Reliant and Williams) that faces the biggest 
potential refunds to the state of California. In fact, Duke reportedly faces 
potential refunds of up to $20 million for the power that it has sold to 
California since the start of this year. 

We can fast forward from FERC's investigation to Duke's ""good faith"" 
settlement offer that now sits before Gov. Gray Davis. The plan sets out 
specific action steps for new generation, conservation programs, electric and 
gas infrastructure improvements, regional transmission frameworks, and 
environmental goals. In addition, Duke has offered an undisclosed settlement 
agreement, for which the California government would agree to cease all 
ongoing investigations of price manipulation by the company. Duke's 
""appropriate payment"" is based on fair estimate of the company's alleged 
overcharges for power that it sold to the state.  

Yet, beyond the spin control surrounding this offer, Duke's proposal amounts 
to a mutual back-scratching agreement, with Duke clearly obtaining the 
largest benefit. Duke wants the state to drop all pending lawsuits that 
allege price gouging and tone down the negative public comments against Duke 
made by the governor and others. In return, Duke will refund to the state 
some of the money that it allegedly owes and will further assist in helping 
the state with its power supply needs. However, under the offer Duke will 
admit no wrongdoing. Rather, the company's proposal is being presented as an 
altruistic effort to assist in the resolution of California's flawed market. 
Neither Duke nor Gov. Davis has disclosed the monetary amount of Duke's 
settlement offer, but it is fairly safe to assume that it is only a fraction 
of the $20 million that the state wants. 

Other specifics within Duke's proposal that are important to note include the 
company's ""commitment to work with the state to get 680 MW of additional 
peaking capacity ready for summer 2002."" In addition, Duke has offered to 
enter into long-term contracts with the state on ""reasonable terms"" and also 
""attempt to secure other reasonably priced electricity for the state."" 
Perhaps eliciting the greatest response within the industry is Duke's pledge 
to ""share the financial pain"" of California's troubled market with other 
market participants. 

Presently, Duke supplies about 5 percent of California's power needs, the 
majority of which is based on long-term contracts. This is a significant 
point because Duke has argued that its participation in the California market 
is not as entrenched in the volatile spot market, in contrast to many of the 
other power suppliers under FERC's investigation. The company also owns the 
Moss Landing plant, located south of San Jose, Calif., which it is upgrading 
with a $500 million investment. Duke has established that the plant should be 
able to provide approximately 30 percent of California's new generation in 
2002.  

While Duke downplays the role that California has played in its profits, the 
company's total wholesale profits soared 374 percent to $744 million for 
year-end 2000. For the year, Duke's California power plants generated 70 
percent more electricity than they did in 1999. In addition, in 2000 the 
plants provided 17 million megawatt hours of electricity to the state's power 
grid versus 9.5 million the previous year. 

Further, in January and February 2001, Duke charged more for power through 
""credit premiums,"" which were levied because of the risk of non-payment 
associated with California's financially struggling utilities. Duke claims 
that it is still owed about $100 million by the Department of Water 
Resources, California's power purchaser. 

Duke is not the only company forging settlement contracts with California. On 
May 2, Tulsa-based Williams Co. (also one of the top four companies 
reportedly owing the most to California) announced that it has agreed to pay 
$8 million to the California ISO to end FERC's investigation into whether the 
company's plants were kept offline to drive up prices. For several months, 
FERC has been investigating Williams regarding the company's alleged shutdown 
of two power generation units owned by AES, which reportedly allowed Williams 
to sell power from other units at higher prices. The stipulation and consent 
agreement reached between Williams and FERC identified no improprieties. In 
other words, Williams has made the payment but has admitted to no wrongdoing 
or price manipulation. A Williams spokesperson has said that the $8 million 
will be deducted from the $252 million that Williams is still owed for power 
sales to the California ISO and the California PX.  

Much like Duke, Williams has reported stellar profits over the last year. For 
year-end 2000, the company reported unaudited income from continuing 
operations of $873.2 million, or $1.95 per share on a diluted basis, versus 
$178 million, or 40 cents per share on a restated basis, for 1999. In 
addition, the company reported 1Q 2001 unaudited results that were more than 
double that of 1Q 2000-$378 million, or 78 cents per share, compared with a 
restated $139 million, or 31 cents per share.  

Moreover, the offers that Williams and Duke are forging with the state of 
California are probably only a small portion of what both companies have made 
from power sales to the state. However, one benefit of the deals is that they 
would keep the parties out of years of expensive litigation. Yet, at least as 
of this writing, Gov. Davis remains less than enthused about Duke's offer and 
has not eased off from his accusation that Duke (along with the other power 
generators) has ""bilked millions of dollars from California consumers."" In 
fact, although the governor has said that he is willing to continue 
negotiations with the various power generators, he has also vowed ""not to 
call off the dogs"" in the state and federal investigation of any price 
gouging. Toward that end, the state's lieutenant governor has initiated a 
class-action suit on behalf of California consumers against Duke and other 
power generators accused of price fixing. This legal claim follows similar 
suits initiated by the city of San Francisco and lawyers in San Diego. All of 
the suits basically claim the same thing, that Duke and four other power 
generators engaged in unlawful trading practices-such as shutting down 
plants-to drive up market prices in California.  

Duke, of course, maintains its innocence and says that the new lawsuit merely 
makes the same old claim that the company has repeatedly denied. 
Nevertheless, Duke has made a monetary offer to the state of California, 
which could be driven merely by the desire to avoid lengthy legal proceedings 
or by a concern that some wrongdoing on the company's part could eventually 
be determined. The stakes have also been raised with some California 
attorneys suggesting that any generators found to have engaged in price 
gouging should face civil and criminal penalties, which could include 
incarceration for any executive at the company who knowingly allowed the 
price manipulation to take place. Consequently, despite Duke's offer and any 
other proposals that subsequently come from power generators, it appears that 
litigation over the price gouging matter is unavoidable.

Interest rate swap market opens up
Financial Times - March 22, 2001
By Janaki Ghatpande

Till about 12 to 15 months ago, the long-term interest rate swap (IRS)
market was dormant for the lack of sufficient benchmarks despite the Reserve
Bank of India (RBI) permitting the instrument as far back as June 1999.
Ironically, in the last few weeks, there has been a spurt in IRS deals,
indicating a development of the market with increased sophistication in the
design of the products.

While swaps did take place in the past, most of them were short-term swaps
for durations between one to three months. Indeed, swaps of 12 months were
the longest available in the market. Bankers had earlier cursed the lack of
satisfactory benchmarks as holding back the market. The problem still
remains, what is different is the bankers have found innovative ways to
price longer term swaps. Now, the long-term interest swaps have gone up to
even five years.

In an IRS, two parties do a swap for a fixed duration wherein an exchange
takes place which is mainly notional. When bank rates fall, a player
reverses his position and books his profits. Thus, they receive a profit
when rates actually fall and vice-versa.

One party agrees to pay a fixed interest rate for the tenor of the swap
while the other party agrees to pay a floating interest rate. This floating
interest is usually fixed on a benchmark from the debt markets which could
vary from the Mumbai Interbank Overnight Rate (Mibor) or a synthetic rate
derived usually based on a poll of market dealers.

""The hindrance with these swaps is that the benchmarks for them are few and
far between. While some benchmark is on one-year interest rate taken from
the Reuters page (poll of dealers), some use the one-year T-bill average
yield against which the fixed rate is determined. Therefore, the increase in
the number of interest rate swaps provides more bench marks than were
available initially,"" said a senior dealer with a foreign bank.

Says Tarun Mehrotri, treasurer, HSBC, ""As a part of its broader strategy of
providing customised and risk management and funding solutions to its
clients, we provide interest rate swap prices benchmarked on both short-term
rates such as Mibor, CP rates and long-term rates such as one-year T-Bills,
government security yields. This provides clients the flexibility of
choosing the benchmark that best suits their balance sheet needs and
addresses their particular asset/liability management requirements.""

""It is primarily a customer-driven and a customised market which is designed
for the corporate keeping in mind their asset liability management point of
view. It is still not monitored. Therefore it is difficult to come up with
an estimate about the volumes,"" said an analyst with a foreign bank.

""A swap can be important tools for banks and corporates who want to hedge
themselves against conflicting interest rate movements,"" he added. In the
market place currently, the average size of swaps is between Rs 25 crore and
Rs 50 crore.

Even the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India
(Fimmda) is now shifting its monthly curve to a daily curve allowing for
more benchmarks. ""The market has a few market makers right now but as the
number of benchmarks increase and get validity, the market will see more
deals in the IRS market,"" said Aashish Pitale vice-president research, JP
Morgan Securities India Private Limited.


Swedish PM not sure of EU financial reform accord.
Reuters - March 22, 2001
By Jan Strupczewski

STOCKHOLM, March 22 (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said on
Thursday he doubted whether reforms to create a single European financial
market would be approved at this week's EU summit in Stockholm.

The reform is key to meeting the 15-nation bloc's self-imposed deadline of
integrating its capital markets by 2005 to boost the competitiveness of
European firms through the same easy, cheap access to funding enjoyed by
U.S. rivals.

""I am sorry to say I am not confident at all. But we will try hard,"" Persson
told a news conference on the eve of the summit, which will review progress
made by the Union towards its goal of becoming the world's most competitive
region by 2010.

""We want to go ahead with it... I hope we will be able to gather not only a
majority but also unanimity for the reform,"" he said.

EU finance ministers are due to meet later on Thursday to discuss the
reform, prepared by a team led by former central banker Alexandre
Lamfalussy.

The Lamfalussy team proposed earlier this month that the EU should adopt a
""fast tack"" procedure under which framework laws could be swiftly enacted,
leaving details to be filled in later by a new European Securities
Commission.

But the proposal has sparked power struggles between the Union's
institutions and met with resistance from Germany, which fears that its
financial centres could be subjected to looser regulation modelled on
London.

Swedish Finance Minister Bosse Rinholm, who will chair the Thursday evening
meeting devoted to the Lamfalussy proposals said agreement on the reform had
reached 99 percent.

The meeting will start at 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) and be followed by a news
conference, the Swedish EU presidency said.

COMMITMENT IN DOUBT

Failure to back the proposals would cast doubt on the EU's public commitment
to an integrated capital market and could further hit the already battered
common currency.

The euro's launch in 1999 created a European capital market with a common
denomination, but the market remains divided in many areas by national
securities laws and accounting practices.

Britain, Denmark and Sweden have opted to remain outside the euro for the
time being.

The financial plan forms part of a wider agenda, laid down by EU leaders
last year, to make the EU the world's most competitive place to do business
within a decade. The March 23-24 summit is due to review progress towards
that goal.

""It is of particular importance that the creation of a common market for
risk capital and financial services will be implemented according to the
timetables agreed,"" Persson wrote in a column in tabloid Expressen on
Thursday.

The task facing the finance ministers is to stop the issue from snarling up
the summit.

The debate turns on the seemingly arcane point of how a new European
Securities Committee would be able to block detailed legislation in areas
such as issue prospectuses and insider trading, proposed by the European
Commission.


Credit derivatives pose unexpected risks, says Moody's head of OTC
Risknet.com - March 21, 2001
By John Ferry

Credit deterioration rather than actual credit default could trigger credit
default swap contracts under current International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (ISDA) definitions, according to a new report by Moody's
Investor Service.

Moody's contends that ISDA'S current definition of a ""credit event"" is
broader than the general market understanding of default.

""ISDA'S current definitions... could, in some cases, increase the risk of
loss by triggering payouts for events that are not actually defaults,""
contended Jeffrey Tolk in his report, 'Understanding the Risks in Credit
Default Swaps'.

""Under a credit default swap, losses to investors are determined
synthetically, based on credit events occurring in a reference credit. Thus,
investors' risk is driven largely by the definition of credit events in the
swap,"" he added.

Credit default swaps are bought as a form of insurance against the risk of a
bond-issuing institution defaulting.

The report states that a restructuring of debt to defer principle payments
may not technically be a default if the lender has been properly
compensated, although ISDA would define this as a credit event.

Under ISDA'S definition of ""obligation acceleration"", a credit default swap
investor might suffer a loss although an investor in the underlying cash
position would not.

ISDA, which is the leading market association for the derivatives industry,
has set up a committee to look at credit derivative trading practices, in
particular credit event definitions.

Moody's said it is difficult to value defaulted credits to determine the
amount of loss to investors under a cash-settled credit default swap.

""Calculated losses may vary based on liquidity, market conditions and the
identity of the parties supplying bids,"" the report said.

There is also a moral hazard problem associated with credit default swaps,
which arises as it is the buyer of protection that determines when a loss
event has occurred and how much loss is imposed on the counterparty. The
buyer has an incentive to be over-generous in loss calculation and to define
a credit event widely, Moody's said.

The expanding credit derivatives market is increasingly gaining the
attention of regulators. In a speech made two weeks ago, David Clementi,
deputy governor of the Bank of England, said he was concerned that market
participants may not fully understand the transactions they have entered.


Watch derivatives, warns bank
Euromoney - March 2001

David Clementi, deputy governor at the Bank of England, says the use of
credit derivatives in securitization poses a threat to capital market
stability.

In the closing address to the International Bond Congress in London,
Clementi surprised borrowers, investors and bankers with his concerns at the
rapid growth of credit derivatives and ABS markets, which many banks hope
compensate for the shrinking returns in bond trading and underwriting.

Clementi said there was a danger of a lack of transparency in the market,
because of the increase in the use of synthetic CLOs, where the risk
attached to loans and bonds is sold on -without a sale of the assets.

""These markets mean that a bank need no longer remain exposed to its main
customers but can rapidly take on large exposures to other credits without
any new borrowing by the underlying entities,"" he said.

Clementi said it was a major challenge for authorities such as the Bank of
England or the
Federal Reserve to keep pace with the rapidly changing world of
securitization and derivatives in collecting financial statistics.

He also fears not all investors understand securitization. ""Some
participants in this market may not fully understand, or may have differing
understandings of, the transactions into which they have entered,"" he said,
adding that uncertainties remain about how courts in different countries I
will treat covenants and agreements in credit derivative deals.

The case of LTY Steel illustrates his concern. LTV is battling Abbey
National in the US over ownership of assets securitized in a deal. The judge
appears to favour LTV though Abbey National says it will appeal if it loses.

Investors, because of this risk, have to make sure they have conducted due
diligence, said Clementi.

The merging of the lending, securities and insurance markets raised new
risks, he said, adding this risk was particularly evident now due to the
debate over whether restructuring of debt constitutes a credit event,
thereby triggering a credit default swap. This row was sparked when Conseco
restructured its debt late last year. The International Swaps and
Derivatives Association has convened meetings to try and find agreement on
this question.

The British Banking Association has predicted that the credit derivatives
business will triple from $586 billion in 1999 to $1/581 billion in 2002.

Accounting changes spell $270m charge for Sears
Financial Times - March 21, 2001
By Christopher Bowe

Sears, Roebuck & Company, the second largest US retailer, said on Wednesday
it plans about $270m in after-tax charges this year due to accounting rules
changes.

The charges will stem from the retailer's adoption of a new Financial
Accounting Standards Board rule on companies~ accounting for use of
derivatives and hedging instruments. Sears detailed the move in its annual
report filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

FASB amended rule No. 133 requires that all of a company's derivatives be
marked to market, valued and recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or
liability. Under the rules, the fair value of the derivatives, which could
range from futures contracts to complex swaps transactions, may be
calculated according to earnings or in ""other comprehensive income"" provided
certain conditions are met.

In that case, derivatives' gains or losses would be measured against the
value of the item that is subject of the hedge on the income statement.

The new accounting rule became effective for all fiscal years starting after
June 15 last year. Sears said it plans to use the new rule starting in the
first quarter this year. As a result it expects to take a cumulative $270m
charge this year. The transition to the new accounting standard includes
recording a $56m cash flow hedging relationship on the balance sheet and
reclassifying deferred losses from terminated interest rate swaps which
amount to $389m. Combined, they are estimated before taxes at about $175m.

The company uses debt and interest rate derivatives and currency hedges to
manage its risk. Much of Sears' profit comes from its credit card arm.

Sears also said in the filing that it expects about 5 per cent operating
income growth and at least 10 per cent earnings per share growth this year.


Impatience and optimism on clearing
Euromoney - March 2001
By Jonathan Brown

London hosted the first worldwide conference of central counterparties last
month to discuss developing a system of seamless global clearing.

The conference was initiated by the Depository Trust and Clearing
Corporation of the US.

Sir David Walker, senior adviser to Morgan Stanley International,
underscored the importance large securities firms attach to this: ""There is,
I believe, a general recognition that the capacity to clear and settle
trades has not kept pace with the capacity of trading platforms to attract
liquidity and handle trades,"" he said. Without serious thought to improving
clearing and settlement, the present infrastructure will not be able to cope
with large increases in volume and trading.

Representatives of central counterparties from the US, Asia and Europe
discussed procedures for operations and risk management, the benefits of
greater cooperation and legal ramifications. All believe there are
advantages to be gained from the more effective use of collateral in the
systems as well as netting which reduces the amount of settlement that needs
to be handled. Referring to efforts to integrate regional clearing and
settlement systems in Europe, Walker said: ""Far greater benefits will accrue
if the CCP and netting arrangements of these new vertical structures are
designed in an inter-operable,
open architecture way.

Jill Considine, chairman of DTCC, was pleased with the progress. ""We've
covered the landscape and gained some very important perspectives on
enhancing CCP capabilities, including the views of regulators, exchanges, as
well as the views of our colleagues at other central counterparties around
the world,"" she remarked. ""And we heard from our customers, telling us how
impatient they have grown with what they view as slow and piecemeal changes
in the industry's infrastructure. We must not lose sight of what the
customers value most - strong risk management, low costs and the stability
and reliability of a seamless infrastructure.""


Basel gives banks the whip hand
Euromoney - March 2001
By Michael Peterson

It has been a long and exhausting labour of love. Between zoo and 300 bank
regulators from the wealthy G10 countries have flown many thousands of miles
and held countless hours of meetings. The Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, which meets under the auspices of the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS), has spent the best part of two years rewriting the rules
on bank capital.

The committee, chaired by New York Federal Reserve president Bill McDonough,
steered the discussions. But the bulk of the work was done by four major
sub-committees. Each sub-committee set up working groups to look into some
detail of the proposed rules. The biggest sub-committee, the capital task
force, spawned no less than half a dozen subcommittees of its own.

The proposal document, released on January r6, is suitably massive. Its 541
pages outline a new world order for bank capital which looks, at first
glance, like a vast improvement
on the 1988 capital accord. Where the old agreement sketched out crude
guidelines for calculating the amount of capital a bank needs, the new
proposals delve into the gritty intricacies of collateral haircuts, clean
break' securitization, materiality thresholds and granularity scaling
factors.

Given the Herculean efforts of this dedicated band of officials, it seems
churlish to suggest that the proposals are flawed. But serious doubts are
emerging about the general direction the committee has taken.

The central element of the new rules is that big banks will be allowed to
set their own capital using internal calculations of risk. The regulators
expect a good number - perhaps 60 to 80 institutions - to be doing this soon
after the new accord is introduced in 2004. But Avinash Persaud, State
Street's head of global research, reckons the trend towards greater reliance
on bank risk management systems is a dangerous one. ""It is a dereliction of
duty by the regulators,"" he says. ""There is no industry with a longer
history of being unable to control its own excesses.

Flawed accord
The need to update the present rules is pressing. Simplicity was the great
virtue of the 1988 capital accord, but it was also the big weakness. The
accord established guidelines for calculating bank capital, with a basic
minimum requirement of 8% and weighting adjustments reflecting the riskiness
of assets.  Members of the BIS then agreed to introduce these as the basis
for national law. The rules have quickly become the standard for other
regulators too, driving up levels of bank capital in many emerging markets,
for example.

The present rules apply a series of weights to the basic 8% capital number
for different assets on banks' balance sheets. Supposedly. risky assets,
such as loans to corporates and asset-backed bonds, are weighted at 100%.
Debts to countries that are members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) are considered risk-free: they are
weighted at 0%. Exposures to banks based in OECD countries count as low risk
assets and are weighted at 20%.

The bank then has to hold capital equivalent to at least 8% of its
risk-weighted assets. And at least half of that capital has to be in the
form of so-called tier-one capital - chiefly equity and reserves. The 8%
figure is a mini-mum. National regulators are free to impose higher levels.
The Federal Reserve, for example, prefers big US banks to hold 10% capital.

The accord's crude system of asset weightings creates some perverse effects.
It means banks based in OECD countries can get much cheaper funding than
those outside the OECD club. This is not necessarily a good thing for
countries that join the OECD. State Street's Persaud points out that the old
Basel system produces regular ""OECD membership crises"". After they were
admitted to the organization during the course of the 1990's Mexico, the
Czech Republic, Poland and Korea all experienced economic booms fuelled by
suddenly cheaper credit. A year or so later, each boom promptly turned to
bust.

Under the 1988 rules, a junk bond portfolio with a heavy concentration of
telecom names is weighted at 100%. Fair enough. But a diversified loan book
of high-quality corporate names is rated at exactly the same level. Banks
know the Basel weightings produce a distorted picture of their true risk,
and many have become adept at finding ways to reduce their regulatory
capital, using tools such as securstization and credit derivatives. Others
have played the system for all it is worth, stocking up on risky, but
low-weighted assets.

""The old regime had broken down because of the complexity of what the large
and sophisticated banks were doing,"" says Oliver Page, director of complex
groups at the UK Financial Services Authority and a member of the Basel
Committee. ""It was leading to capital arbitrage and we could no longer be
confident that the resulting capital matched the risks they were actually
taking.""

Dynamite in the draft
The Basel Committee's first thoughts on revising the capital accord were
mostly about re-jigging the problematic risk weightings. A discussion
document released in June 1999 proposed a series of refinements to the
original risk bucket method. The number of risk weighting bands would be
increased and the OECD link would be scrapped. But what better measure of
credit risk could be used? The committee proposed a controversial solution:
weighting assets according to their credit ratings from the private sector
rating agencies.

The idea of incorporating credit ratings into the accord created a few
misgivings. For one thing many borrowers, especially in Europe, are not
rated. Some also worried that borrowers would cherry-pick the most
favourable ratings. The agencies themselves were not overjoyed at the
proposal. They quibbled over what they saw as inconsistent application of
their ratings from one asset class to another.

The 1999 proposal didn't stop at refining the weightings. It introduced a
couple of new ideas. One was that banks should be charged for operational
risk - the risk of things like system failures and rogue traders.

But the real dynamite came half-way through the 62-page document. The
committee conceded that a small number of very big, sophisticated banks
might be allowed to bypass the whole standard weightings process altogether.
They would be able to set their own capital requirements - in consultation
with their regulator using their own models of risk.

Risk modelling has become a growth industry in recent years. Big banks argue
that they can now model and manage their risk in a highly sophisticated way.
Their models give them a detailed picture of the risks inherent in their
business and the amount of capital they need to set aside for those risks.
Usually, the models say banks need to carry less capital than they would
using the standard risk-weighting method.

Between June 1999 and the end of 2000, as the committees and sub-committees
met to thrash out the details of the new system, the internal-ratings based
approach grew into the biggest part of the proposals. And no longer was it
only the very biggest banks that would be allowed to use internal models.
Now, any decent-size bank could aspire to calculating its own capital needs.

""The big change from our June 1999 paper is that we have designed an
internal-ratings based approach that a good number of banks should be able
to apply,"" says the FSA's Page. ""In June 1999 we just talked about applying
it to some sophisticated banks. But over time we expect a major share of the
banking system will be on the internal-ratings based approach.""
It is not completely clear why the committee decided to apply the
internal-ratings based approach more widely. The official line is that a
large number of banks have demonstrated their capability in risk modelling.
But some close observers reckon the committee was under strong pressure from
some European authorities - particularly the German representatives - to
allow a lower threshold for the internal models approach.

The new proposals talk about three approaches to setting capital. The
simplest, the standardized approach, is an extension of the present system,
but with risk buckets now linked to credit ratings. A triple-A sovereign
carries a 0% risk weighting. Single-A sovereigns, double-A corporates and
triple-A supranationals are weighted at 20%. Most loans with a B in their
rating fall into the 100% bracket.

There are also two new weightings. Single-A corporates and triple-B
sovereigns fall into a 50% band. A few risky assets, such as single-B
corporates, carry a 150% weighting. Where a borrower has two ratings, the
lower rating will be used to prevent cherry-picking.

The internal-ratings based approach divides into two different methods:
foundation and advanced. Both approaches allow banks to calculate their own
risks. In the foundation method, the regulator supplies some of the
parameters for the model. In the grown-up version, banks get to do all the
calculations.

The internal-ratings based approach should have several big advantages over
the simpler method. It should dramatically reduce the scope for regulatory
arbitrage, since the differences between a bank's economic capital - the
capital that reflects its true risks - and its regulatory capital will be
too small to bother about.

The internal-ratings based method also has much steeper charges for the very
riskiest assets. Under the standardized approach, the highest risk weighting
is 150%. But under the internal models approach, an asset could carry a 625%
weighting. (In other words, for every dollar at risk, the bank would set
aside 50 cents of capital, assuming it was aiming for 8% risk-weighted
capital.)

But how can we trust banks to set their own capital? The authors of the
proposals give two reasons. First, the regulators will not simply sit back
and let the banks do their own thing. In fact, they will need to step up
their efforts to supervise banks, recruiting teams of savvy analysts to pore
over the banks' calculations.

Second, the market will police the system. One lengthy section of the
proposal - known, for no particularly good reason, as pillar three requires
banks to disclose to the market information on their risk exposures,
risk-management strategies and credit risk mitigation techniques.

""We are moving towards a world in which the regulators step back and allow
the market to police itself,"" says Mark Intrater, London based managing
director at consultancy Oliver Wyman. ""If a bank reports its risks and the
market doesn't like it, that bank will have a hard time getting funding on
favourable terms and its stock price will drop. The world is not ready for
that yet, but this is a step towards it. Markets will always be able to move
faster than any regulations that could be drafted.""

Disclosure - or what one analyst, in attempt to catch the mood of the
moment, calls the ""Big Brother"" part of the proposals -is designed to
prevent banks abusing the internal-ratings based approach. ""If we can get
market discipline to work then it won't be the capital regime that drives
the amount of capital banks have, it will be market pressure,"" says Page.
""We see this already. Because of market pressures, banks already hold
materially more capital than we set as their minimum.

Using banks' internal models to calculate capital may be an attractive
solution to the tricky problem of how to regulate large and sophisticated
banks. But the approach is open to several lines of criticism.

Some say the banks' own models are not all they are cracked up to be. Stare
Street's Persaud says that banks do need risk-management systems, but the
ones they use today are imperfect. ""These marker-sensitive risk-management
systems all have the same philosophical flaw,"" he says. ""They assume that
every bank is acting independently: they assume that when they sell, there
is a marker to sell into.

In other words, they understate the real riskiness of panicky, illiquid
markets. ""The use of banks' internal models can be a problem,"" agrees
Standard & Poor's analyst Tanya Azarchs, ""to the extent that everyone starts
to use the same kind of models to determine the credit risk of a loan. If
that model is false-signalling it could cause real problems when everyone
heads for the exits at the same time.

What's more, greater disclosure might exacerbate the problem of what Persaud
calls herding. ""We are going down the wrong path in insisting on more
disclosure,"" he says. ""Every crisis follows a boom. This tells us that the
crisis is not about a lack of information. It is not about some domestic ill
that the right risk management system could have told us about. The cause of
the crisis lies somewhere in people's collective loss of sense during the
original boom.""

Persaud believes the right approach to preventing crises is to encourage
contrarian investing. ""We need heterogeneity,"" he says. ""We need lots of
different types of investors playing lots of different types of markets with
lots of different strategies and risk management systems. This emphasis on
transparency is encouraging more herdlike and less contrarian behaviour.
This is why markets are becoming ever bigger in terms of turnover but ever
thinner in terms of liquidity.""

The proposals may discourage contrarianism in other ways too. Use of
internal credit models may exacerbate natural economic cycles by encouraging
banks to lend heavily in the good times and cut back on credit when the
economy turns down depressing ratings.
For example, as the US economy has stalled in recent months, bankruptcies
have risen and credit ratings have fallen. Banks' internal credit models
presumably show the same decline in asset quality. Under the
internal-ratings based approach, banks' risk-weighted assets would now be
increasing and their regulatory capital requirement would be going up. That
would encourage them to freeze new credits. In times of rising credit
quality, the reverse would apply, perhaps fuelling a boom.

Another criticism of the banks' internal models is that they are not
conservative enough. S&P's Azarchs thinks banks' own capital models award
them too much benefit for the diversity of their portfolios. 'Banks'
internal portfolio models suggest they could run on as little as half the
capital they have now,"" she says.  'We don't believe that is the case. We
don't think there is excess capital in the system. If this proposal winds up
decapitalizing the system, that would be very concerning.

For now, banks would not be entitled to a capital reduction purely on the
grounds of credit diversity, although this is something that the Federal
Reserve has hinted could be introduced later. As a result, the banks'
calculations of regulatory capital will still typically come out higher than
their calculations of economic capital under the internal models approach.

Unrealistically short maturities are another problem with banks' own models.
""Most banks' internal models assume a hold rate of one year or less,"" says
Azarchs. ""That is one reason their internal models show a capital surplus.""

She believes the advanced internal-ratings based approach falls into the
same trap of underestimating maturities. The foundation version of the
internal-ratings based approach assumes that all loans have a maturity of
three years a reasonably cautious assumption. But on the advanced approach,
banks will be able to plug the legal maturity of loans into their capital
calculations.

Azarchs thinks this would be a mistake. ""We don't think this is the right
way to think about it,"" she says. ""A loan has nothing to do with its stated
term, it is representative of a relationship. As long as things are going
well, one expects the loan to be rolled over.""
If the capital models give recognition for short legal maturities, banks may
simply extend short loans and roll them over. Banks would employ the same
kind of capital arbitrage they do today when they extend 364-day credit
facilities: such loans are designed to benefit from the zero risk weighting
of undrawn loans with a maturity of less than one year.

National pride
Another worrying aspect of the new models-based approach to bank capital is
that it will mean different things to different regulators. In a way this is
no different from the situation with the current capital accord. But at
least the 5988 version has the virtue of being simple enough for the most
backward regulator to understand.

""Were not sure that all national regulators are equipped to supervise the
internal-ratings based approach,"" says Azarchs at S&P.  ""There would
probably be an incentive for all of them to vet a few of their largest banks
right out of the gate - on the assumption that these big sophisticated banks
must know what they are doing.""

National pride might also sway some regulators to treat their charges
leniently. ""There is still scope for significant discrepancies in the way
these proposals are implemented, particularly in pillar two [supervision],""
says John Tattersall, partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London. ""Very few
regulators will want the embarrassment of deciding that their major banks
are short of capital.""

So what is to stop a regulator letting a few of its banks graduate to the
internal-ratings based approach even when their risk management systems are
nor up to scratch? ""The idea of a completely level playing field is an
unreachable goal,"" says Page at the FSA. 'But we will have processes to try
to ensure there is a reasonably even-handed treatment across the G10. This
will not be some kind of central policing. It will involve being open about
what is going on in each others' countries and feeling free to comment.
Market forces act as another constraint. If a supervisor is known to be a
soft touch, the banks under its supervision will be penalized in the market
place.""

Some large banks are privately worried that their own regulators will apply
the new rules more harshly than supervisors in other countries. The
disclosure requirements in the proposal are another big source of concern
for some of them. ""The committee seems to have taken a kitchen-sink approach
to disclosure,"" says Tattersall at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""Everything that
might be desirable seems to have been included.""

But Page at the FSA appears to offer some hope that the disclosure
requirements will be watered down. ""You need a fair amount of information to
make the internal-ratings based approach work,"" he says. ""The disclosure
requirements we have proposed are desirable, but we also need to be sure
they are cost effective for banks. It may be there are better ways of
arriving at the same results. I certainly hope banks will give us good
feedback on this point.'

The Basel accord is only supposed to apply in the Gin countries, but some
observers have begun to think about the impact of the proposals on the rest
of the world. ""Basel was never designed for emerging-market banks,"" says Ian
Linnell, an analyst at Fitch in London. ""But in reality it is adopted by any
banking system that wants to be taken seriously. And the idea that riskier
entities should hold more capital is definitely one that should apply to
banks in emerging markets.""

He believes the proposals could have some unintended consequences in less
developed banking systems. ln practice, most emerging market regulators will
adopt the standardized version with some modifications. Others will stick
with the current version of the accord -something they are perfectly
entitled to do. ""We will end up with four different methodologies for
calculating bank capital - the 1988 version of Basel, the standardized
approach, the foundation internal-ratings based approach and the advanced
internal-ratings based approach,"" says Linnell. ""Add the salt and pepper of
charges for things like operational risk and you have a recipe for
confusion. The whole concept of a minimum level of tier-one capital could
become relatively meaningless.""

Time to collect data
One key uncertainty in all this is how many banks will use each of the three
new ways of calculating capital. The consensus at the moment is that a
minority of banks - but a
 majority of banking assets - will quickly move to using internal models.

""My sense is that in 2004 about 40 banks around the world will adopt the
foundation approach immediately and that maybe two or three will go straight
for the advanced approach,"" says Azarchs at S&P. Within half a decade, the
best part of too institutions could be setting their own capital.

That means banks need to start crunching a lot more data. ""The timing is
tight,"" says Tattersall at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""Banks need to start
collecting the data next year in order to have the necessary three years of
historical data by 2004.""

In order to use the foundation version of the internal-ratings approach,
banks need to input reliable data for every asset's probability of default.
If they want to graduate to advanced, they should also be able to make
assumptions about loss severity or recovery rates. ""The internal-ratings
based approach looks great in theory,"" says Linnell at Fitch. ""But there is
a real problem with the quality of data. Banks may have a reasonably good
handle on probability of default, but it is very hard to get hold of data on
recovery rates.

Up until now, banks have been surprisingly poor at keeping consistent
records on how many of their borrowers have defaulted and how much of a hit
they took as a result. Even the most rigorous institutions are hazy about
some areas of their business. ""Most big, sophisticated banks have rating
systems for some loans that would pass regulatory muster,"" says Intrater at
Oliver Wyman. ""But they also have categories of special loans that are
managed in a less sophisticated manner. It is simply the difference between
using a system for internal management purposes and using it for external
reporting purposes.""
Clearly, banks will need to improve their record keeping. It has been widely
suggested that this scramble to put new systems in place will increase the
pace of banking consolidation. Smaller banks, it is assumed, will not be
able to make the necessary investment in technology.

On the other hand, bank mergers have often made it more difficult to get
systems in place. According to Azarchs at S&P, Canadian banks have some of
the best historical data in the world. This is because Canadian institutions
have been prevented from merging. US banks, by contrast, often find it
difficult to reconcile data from a number of legacy systems.

One widespread assumption so far has been that smaller banks will ignore the
internal-ratings based methods and stick with the standardized approach. ""A
lot of small, specialist retail operations will - quite appropriately
-ignore everything beyond the standardized approach,"" says Intrater.
But the internal models approach could yet gain a momentum of its own. If
internal models are successfully used by as many as 6o or 8o banks to reduce
their capital requirements, smaller banks may want to join the party too.
This will certainly be the case if the technology and expertise needed to
use the approach become relatively cheap commodities.

""Perhaps one or two banks might develop a certain way of doing
internal-ratings based measurement and start to franchise that procedure out
to smaller banks,"" suggests Raj Malhotra, credit analyst at Goldman Sachs in
London. ""Smaller banks might be willing to pay for that.""

Just as the original Basel accord was soon adopted much more widely than it
was originally intended, so the internal-ratings based approach could become
the standard for any bank which aspires to international respectability.
Once the floodgates of internal capital calculation have been opened, they
may not be easily closed.

Power to the regulator
If that happens, a lot of regulators will need to learn a whole new set of
skills. There are broadly two approaches to bank regulation. The first
involves laying down the rules and checking that banks comply with them. The
second, often called bank supervision, is more intensive: it involves making
individual judgements about each bank's risks and appropriate levels of
capital and continually checking that banks are playing it safe.

The FSA is proud of its record in bank supervision. ""In the UK we have
recognized for a long time that there is no way to collect all the
information you need, put it through some number cruncher and come out with
an answer for the amount of capital a bank needs,"" says Page. ""There are
areas where judgement is required in forming the answer.

The Basel Committee proposals have quite a lot to say about banking
supervision - or, in Basel-speak, pillar two. The proposal exhorts
regulators to review banks' internal capital adequacy assessments and to
intervene early to stop a bank's capital falling below the level appropriate
to that bank's risk characteristics.

But this level of supervision will be much harder for some regulators to put
in practice than others. And it is not simply that some regulators are smart
and others are dullards. ""Regulators such as the Federal Reserve have the
advantage of a relatively small number of large banks to manage,"" says
Intrater at Oliver Wyman. ""Others, such as the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency [which regulates smaller US institutions], supervise a large
number of small banks. They will need a much larger staff of supervisors.

Some observers have the feeling that the more clued-up regulators, notably
the Federal Reserve and the FSA, are getting too far ahead of their less
sophisticated colleagues. ""A lot of national regulators lack the powers to
go in and do this kind of pillar-two supervisory control,"" says Azarchs at
S&P. ""In addition, they may not have the experience or the staff to do it.""

Is it realistic to expect all regulators to supervise their banks in the way
set out in the proposals? ""Not all supervisors will suddenly set
differentiated requirements for all banks,"" says Page at the FSA. ""But I
would expect that they will look at some of the bigger ones and at some of
the outliers.""

But the Basel Committee can't force countries to invest in creating powerful
and expert regulators, even though this is exactly what the internal-ratings
based approach requires.
""These proposals appear to give greater powers to the market but in some
ways they do the opposite,"" says Linnell at Fitch. ""Regulators will need to
set key data inputs and supervise the entire internal-ratings based
approach. That will increase the burden on regulators. Many are not going to
have the people or expertise to cope.""

The big uncertainty of the Basel proposals lies with the capabilities of the
world's bank regulators. Much of the epic work they have written makes good
sense. But when the new accord is implemented in the real world, it will -
like the 1988 accord before it - take on a life of its own.

The New Power Company: Going Green While Stock Price Drops
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

The New Power Company (TNPC, NYSE: NPW), which bills itself as the first
national residential and small business energy provider, announced that
it has signed a Letter of Intent with Community Energy, Inc. to provide
wind-generated energy to customers in the Philadelphia area. Under the
terms of the agreement, TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community
Energy from a site under development in the mountains of northeast 
Pennsylvania.
The new wind turbines are scheduled to come online by the end of 2001.

ANALYSIS: This is an interesting development, especially considering that
TNPC is still embroiled in a battle with Green Mountain for a significant
number of customers that TNPC recently secured in a bidding process from
PECO Energy. This could be an attempt on the part of TNPC to appease customers
who might have preferred to be served by Green Mountain. On the other hand,
it could be a shrewd marketing strategy from the energy service company,
founded earlier this year by Enron (along with partners AOL and IBM).

As you may recall, just two weeks ago TNPC announced that it had reached
an agreement with PECO Energy to supply ""competitive default service"" for
approximately 300,000 of PECO's residential electricity customers who have
not selected a competitive energy service provider. Green Mountain formally
challenged this agreement, arguing that the PECO/TNPC agreement is ""not
in the public interest"" and that Green Mountain should have been awarded
the right to serve as the default provider for the customers in question.
Thus, it seems curious that TNPC has just now announced the addition of
wind power to its portfolio of services. Up to this point, TNPC has been
working to aggressively acquire customers from other energy providers,
such as the approximately 285,000 natural gas and 20,000 electricity customers
it purchased from Columbia Energy Group. The acquisition of the customers
in PECO's territory was a major coup for TNPC, which is still in start-up
mode. Although TNPC claims that it was fairly awarded the customers from
PECO, the addition of wind power could be seen as an attempt to quell further
objections from Green Mountain or perhaps the beginning of a new identity
as a provider of renewable energy.

Community Energy, the company from whom TNPC is securing the wind power
that it will market, began making wind power available to businesses in
Pennsylvania last year. TNPC customers will be able to buy wind energy
in fixed kilowatt-hours, allowing for more customized service and tailored
use of power. Interestingly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just renewed
a contract with Green Mountain in which Green Mountain will supply about
37,500 MW of green power to aggregated state agencies. This indicates that
desire for green power is quite strong in Pennsylvania, and any energy
provider wanting to market in the state would be wise to include green
power in its portfolio. Thus, while renewable energy was not a fundamental
component of TNPC's original business plan, the company appears to be moving
in this direction (at least in states where it is strategic to do so).

However, this announcement comes on the heels of TNPC's announcement of
its third-quarter earnings and a sudden drop in its stock price. TNPC's
revenues for 3Q 2000 were $18.2 million, derived from the sale and delivery
of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in just two states 
(Pennsylvania
and New Jersey). Gross profit was $1.3 million, or 7.2 percent of revenues.
Yet, the loss on earnings before income tax (EBIT) was $68.3 million. The
net loss for the quarter was $69.9 million, or $2.96 per basic share. TNPC
reiterates that it is a new company with a very limited operating history.
Therefore, the company contends that its year-over-year comparisons are
not meaningful or indicative of future performance. The company's goal
for 4Q 2000 is to achieve revenues of approximately $60 to $63 million,
with an estimated year-end customer count of 340,000.

Eugene Lockhart, TNPC's CEO, said he was pleased with the 3Q performance.
Lockhart contends that TNPC ""achieved both our overall financial performance
targets and business objectives,"" and referenced the fact that the company
is still building its ""systems and architecture"" so that it can continue
to penetrate additional competitive markets. In addition, TNPC has raised
approximately $546 million in funding which the company is using primarily
to build its brand identity in this early stage of its operation.

However, despite its positive outlook, after TNPC made its earnings 
announcement
its shares took a nosedive, perhaps reflecting uncertainty about the energy
provider's ability to meet its objectives. The shares closed last Friday
at $9, which is a dramatic drop from the average price of $25 before the
3Q earnings announcement. TNPC issued its IPO on Oct. 5, 2000, at a price
of $21 per share, which at the time seemed quite high for a start-up energy
company with a limited track record. A day after its opening, the stock
closed at $27 per share. The stock was received so favorably for two reasons,
in my estimation. First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments.
In two separate, private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital
Equity Investments and DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214
million in start-up capital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron
is the majority owner of TNPC, with 57-percent control. Second, and perhaps
more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferred its residential and
small commercial retail operations in California and Ohio to TNPC. Together
with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC has come out of the gate
running with a significant beginning customer base of over 325,000 customers.

Yet clearly investors are now questioning the strength of TNPC stock, and
the company is at a crossroads. In order to keep its momentum on track,
TNPC needs to do two things. First, it needs to acquire additional customers
to expand its base. Key states such as Texas or Ohio offer the best 
opportunity
to secure customers since competition is unfolding at a more rapid pace
in those states. Second, as I discussed in my IssueAlert from Nov. 6, 2000,
energy stocks that are based on new technologies in general and alternative
fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors.
Consequently, it is a very shrewd move for TNPC to suddenly announce that
it will be a provider of wind power. This could potentially send the stock
price on a upward climb again, despite the fact that financial success
of the company is still unproven.

Regarding the customer base expansion, Ohio looks like the next state that
TNPC will target. Just last week, the company filed an application with
the Ohio Public Utility Commission to provide electricity in the state.
Yet, it's clear that TNPC is still fine-tuning its marketing approach.
In Ohio, it is offering customers competitive energy prices, flexible payment
and pricing choices, and frequent flier miles as a marketing incentive,
but there is no mention in TNPC's application that it will provide renewable
energy in Ohio.

Moreover, several questions remain. Does TNPC plan to carve out a new role
for itself as a renewable energy provider, or it just providing wind power
in Pennsylvania to preserve its market edge in the state? Will the addition
of wind power positively benefit the stock price of TNPC? Will TNPC 
demonstrate
revenues of $63 million in 4Q 2000? And where will the company's next 
acquisition
of customers take place? All of these questions directly impact the future
success of TNPC.

Some 10-to-90-percent splits are good, like giving one-tenth of  what you 
make to those less fortunate, or putting 10 percent of your income  into a 
smart savings plan. Others are bad, like being a   miserly 10-percent tipper 
or using only that tiny portion of the  capabilities of your powerful 
computer software. Worst of all is the fact  that most of us use only 10 
percent of our intelligence and   creative potential, leaving vast quantities 
of what we're  capable lying dormant, unused, and untapped. It's this ratio 
that Robert  Cooper hopes to help reverse with ""The Other 90%,"" his   
inspirational guide to waking the sleeping giant within.

1317,"Lynch and Wood Running the meeting

Lynch started out castigating FERC for the ""failure to act"", sellers for high 
prices forcing CA into this action.  Has some charts in the press package.  
Talked about how wonderful the Govs proposals have been.  Said net short is 
34%.  Sellers ""have us over a barrell"" for those sales.  Attorney Gen 
continues investigation of the sellers. These are all for going forward costs 
-- this doesn't address the ""$ for the hot dog, which is being taken care of 
in Sacramento.""  She said these proposals ensure reliability and allow 
Treasurer to issue bonds.  Continues to castigate FERC throughout the call. 
Wants new appointments to FERC from the states -- ""our cries have fallen on 
deaf ears""

Lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow:

1.  Wood's proposal -- modified -- Order the IOUs to pay the QFs beginning 
4/1 on a going forward basis only.  Modified existing formula in Section 390 
(Legislative change to this section did not pass yet).  Shifts the gas index 
from Topoc (where Wood says the prices are being mnipulated) to Malin, where 
prices have been more stable.

2. Sets the CA Procurement Adjustment -- Orders the IOUs to pay the DWR for 
purchases.  At one point she said that the order would be for all power for 
purchased by the state beginning Jan 19; at another point she said that the 
payments are for going forward costs. ""It's time to pay the power bills for 
California.""  CPA calculated based on the ""residual"" method, rather than the 
proportional method.  Payments to DWR made on the proportional method, 
however.

3.  Lynch alternate setting a 3 cents/kWh increase in accordance with AB 1X. 
(The ALJ decision said no rate increase.) Makes the 1 cent temp charge 
permanent (didn't say if its additive with the 3 cents) Believe this covers 
ALL needs on a going forward basis.  According to  ABX 1, small customers 
with 130% over baseline get no increase, small customers with 200% increase, 
get a 9 % increase -- the rest get socked, I guess.  Adopted TURN's 
accounting proposal.  Will look at rate design in a future proceeding.  Takes 
IOUs 30-45 days to charge the rates; will conduct a rate design proceeding 
during that time period (see # 5).

4. Orders an investigation into the Utility holding company structure to see 
if it is best for the public utilities.

A new proceeding was also identified.

5.  Lynch is issuing an Assigned Comissioner ruling proposing a new rate 
structure. (I presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use)  
Need information from DWR to calculate rates and DWR has not yet provided 
it.  Described the need to have a record on this. As mentioned in #3 above -- 
would expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30- 45 days.

In one of the above orders, Lynch said that she orders the utililities to go 
after sellers using all legal means for the unjust and unreasonable prices.

I'm still listening.

Subject:  AG suit to oust ISO Board

ATTORNEY GENERAL SUES TO REMOVE STAKEHOLDER MEMBERS OF ISO BOARD
Seeks To Allow Replacement By Consumer-Oriented Members

January 23, 2001
01-006
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

(SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Lockyer today filed suit to have the
26 stakeholder members of the California Independent System Operator
Corporation vacate their office, seeking to pave the way for a newly
reconstituted board representing the interests of consumers.

The ""quo warranto"" action was filed in Sacramento County Superior Court.
The lawsuit asks the court to have the 26 sitting ISO members ousted from
their positions. The Attorney General has offered current members an
opportunity to resign and avoid further litigation.

The legal move seeks to speed implementation of the new law, AB 5X, which
reconstitutes the ISO into a board of five members appointed by the
governor and confirmed by the Electricity Oversight Board.

Governor Davis has appointed the five new members of the ISO governing
board pursuant to the new law.

The ISO board is responsible for operating, controlling and managing the
power transmission lines that deliver electricity throughout California and
between neighboring states.

I mentioned to you that we had met with the Enron SAP team several weeks ago to discuss pros and cons of Azurix Corp. moving to SAP.  Our main reason for exploring this was the fact that key functions in closing our Oracle books, due to attrition, were only known by one employee.  This employee is a manager (Virginia Krobot), and the other remaining permanent accounting staff is an accounting clerk and two A/P people.  There are some parts of the closing that are only being performed by AccountTemps personnel.  We are transitioning these to Azurix employees as we can.

I spoke today to Mark Schmidt with the SAP team.  I told him before we moved any further on exploring this option, I thought we should get your thoughts. 

 If we lose the manager in our group we will have difficulty closing the books.  As you can imagine, Azurix does not have much attractiveness to potential employees to supplement our current staff, and given the direction we are heading, it doesn't make sense to recruit new staff.  In addition, a conversion will not come cheap, although the SAP team was not planning on a full implementation.  They used the term ""SAP trial balance company.""  

We could save the cost of implementation if you believe that within your group, we could get an accounting senior specialist or manager who could give me assistance with Oracle, should Virginia resign.  Virginia will give us enough notice that we could have myself and someone from your group crash learn the closing functions.

Let me know if you think we should proceed looking at SAP.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

1364,"This is from Carol Word, she is working on the Prayer List and will send it 
shortly.

Hello all.  My husband and I just returned from a trip to the Alsace region
of France over the Thanksgiving holiday and I thought I would pass on a
little something that applies to the Christmas season I learned.

Alsace lies at the It seems the tradition of decorating a tree for Christmas
began in this area (if there were no borders it would be part of the Black
Forest region of Germany).  The Alsacians are a generous, hardworking,
loving people as a whole.  Many wonderful people have come from this region.
One of the greatest is Dr. Albert Schweitzer.  Dr. Schweitzer began as a
master organist, built them actually and wrote books about them.  Then, he
felt called to the ministry and was a pastor with a compassionate heart.  He
was in Paris at a missions conference and was moved to hear of the tribes in
Africa, lost, without hope, practically no medical care and felt the Holy
Spirit move in his life once again.  He studied medicine and he, his wife
and a team of compassionate men and women moved to Gabon on the West Coast
of Africa and opened a hospital.  There, they cared for the sick in body and
spirit.

The tradition of the Christmas tree began in the early 1500's.  There was a
pastor who was coming home in the early winter evening having visited a
parishioner.  It was nearing the time of celebrating the Birth of Jesus.  As
he made his way through the dark woods, he came upon a fir tree bathed in
light.  It seemed a star sat upon the top of the tree.  The sight held such
wonder that he wanted to share it with his family.  Then, he began to see
the true story and felt that maybe it was not just coincidence that he
happened up that sight.  He cut the tree and began to dress it up in red
with white candles for his church and here is what he told the people (in my
words of course):

The tree is to remind us why Jesus came.  He came to die upon the tree for
our freedom.  The evergreen represents life even when death is all around
(all the other trees loose their leaves and ""die"") but only the evergreen
goes against the flow.  Its life flows from deep within.  The life of the
Christian flows from deep within.  So, the tree represents life.

The red ribbons and bow represent His Blood shed for us.  The scarlet ribbon
that covers the tree as His Blood that covers our sins.

The white candles represent (1) purity - we are cleansed and made pure
through the shed blood upon the tree, and (2) Light - that Jesus is the
Light of the World and the light on the tree is the Light on our lives.  He
said WE are the light of the world when we allow Him to live in us.

As time passed, all kinds of things have been added and the REAL purpose of
the tree has been forgotten.  One more VERY important thing that is added to
a European tree is the manger.  It is set up under the tree in the center
with a place of prominence.  Usually, the Christ Child is not added until
Christmas morning.  The tree in Europe is left in place until January when
the Three Wise Men came from the east to worship the King and this is when
gifts are usually exchanged.

While I love the giving (and the getting!) and the gathering and the eating
all the fun things that go with Christmas as much as the next person and
maybe more than some, I would like to encourage us all as we enter the
season.  If you have an artificial or real tree, a ""color theme"" or mix and
match, as you set the tree, remember Who died on a tree for you and your
home.  Let it represent in your home His sacrifice on the bare tree.  Let's
pray for the opportunity to witness in a different way to our unsaved
friends and family.  If you have a tree in your home this year, and you have
unsaved family, as you decorate it, each time you admire it, pray

""Father, let this tree represent You in this home.  Let Your Light shine
through me.  Let me share Your gifts You have given me with those You place
in my path.  As I wrap each present, I pray Your anointing goes with that
gift.  Let the sweater, the scarf, the article of clothes represent Your
covering over that loved one.  Let that toy bring joy to that child and open
a way for me to minister in a fresh way to that young heart.  Each time the
keyboard on that computer is touched, as I touch it, Lord, I know Your
Spirit linger there as it did for Elijah on that bed and the child was
raised.  I want Your resurrection power to flow through me to each person
You have given me to care for.  As I hang ornaments on the tree, let each
one represent a habit, a fear, a concern, a pain, a past unforgiven, a
sickness, a financial burden, a child, a husband, a wife, a future unknown
and uncertain, and the act of hanging be an act of faith of hanging it on
the cross.  An act of placing that care in Your capable Hands.  As the
lights are strung on the tree and home, let Your light shine through me.
Let my home be a beacon of Your Love in a dark, hurting, crying, sighing,
dying world.  As I meet with friends and family and reach out to hug, let my
arms be Your Arms reaching out in love.  Use me, mold me, make me what I
ought to be so I can be more like You.  In Jesus' Name...Amen!""

Just a thought I wanted to share.  We have a chance to make a real
difference in our homes as we allow Jesus to make a difference in our
hearts.

I love you all....Carol Word

1372,"THE EMPTY CHAIR 

 ?A man's daughter  had asked the local minister to come and pray 
  with her father.  When the minister arrived, he found the man lying 
  in bed with his head propped up on two pillows.  An empty chair 
  sat beside his bed.  The minister assumed that the old fellow had 
  been informed of his visit. ""I ?guess you were expecting me,""  he said. 
 ? 
 ?""No, who are you?""  said the father. 
 ? 
 ?The minister told him his name and then remarked, ""I see the empty 
  chair; I figured you knew I was going to show up."" 
 ? 
 ?""Oh yeah, the chair,""  said the bedridden man. ""Would you mind closing 
  the door?""  Puzzled, the minister ?shut the door. ""I have never told anyone 
  this, not even my daughter,"" said the man. ""But all of  my life I have 
 ?never ?known how to pray.   At church I used  to hear the pastor 
 ?talk about prayer, but it went right over my  head.  I abandoned 
 ?any attempt at prayer,"" the old man continued, ""until one day about 
 ?four years ago my best friend said to me, 'Johnny, prayer is just 
 ?a simple matter of having a  conversation with Jesus.  Here is what 
 ?I suggest.  ""Sit down in a chair; place an empty chair in front of 
 ?you, and in faith see Jesus on the chair.   It's not spooky because he 
 ?promised, ""I'll  be with you always."" Then just speak to him in the 
 ?same way  you're doing with me right now.' ""So, I tried it and I've liked it
 ?so much that I do it a couple of hours every day.  I'm careful though. 
 ?If my daughter saw me talking to an empty chair, she'd either 
 ?have a nervous breakdown or send me off to the funny farm."" 
 ? 
 ?The minister was deeply moved by the story and encouraged the 
  old man to continue on the  journey.  ?Then he prayed with him, 
  anointed him with oil, and  returned to the church. Two nights later 
  the daughter called to  tell the minister  that her daddy had died 
  that afternoon. 

  ""Did  he die in peace?"" he asked. 
 
 ?""Yes, when I  left the house about two o' clock, he called me over to 
  his  bedside, told me he loved me and kissed me on the cheek.   
  When I  got back from the store an hour later, I found him dead. 
  ""But there was something strange about his death. Apparently, 
  just  before Daddy died, he leaned over and rested his head on 
  the chair beside the bed. What do you make of ?that?""

like that.""

I took it from Stan's last message that he may or may not be interested in

1391,"Good morning, Kevin!

My name is Mark Putnam and I am contacting you on
behalf of our company, EULAN Corporation.

I read the Houston Chronicle article on Enron Kids
yesterday and I must say I was very impressed. EULAN
is a business analysis and documentation firm who
worked for Enron for over a year. I myself spent a
year on site working with some of Enron's people--all
bright and motivated people--and I have been greatly
disturbed by the recent events that are transpiring.
All of the folks that I had the chance to work with
are good people, and I hate to see anything affect
them negatively, especially during the holidays.

I wanted to let you know about a particular service
that EULAN offers to non-profit organizations. Grant
writing is a service that often times NPOs do not have
the time or expertise to look into. EULAN's grant
writers offer experience, knowledge, and the time that
Enron Kids' personnel may not have. I know that the
program's future is in question, and would like to
discuss how we can help.

I'm sure you're quite busy with the holiday's right
now, but feel free to reply to this email address or
give me a call at 713-962-0907. I would be happy to
discuss the possibilities available to you or maybe
set a meeting for after the holidays.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Mark Putnam

Please find attached the force majeure provisions from the draft Sales and 
Purchase Agreement between Enron Marketing and El Paso.  This represents 
considerable effort to date to find a mutually acceptable alternative to the 
Term Sheet language I forwarded to you as well.

Rightly or wrongly, this language does not address the issue of ""operating 
condition"" as a similar concept to force majeure, specifically in terms of a 
performance standard.  This may still come up with El Paso, but I am 
certainly prepared to talk to the Southern Company about it and get their 
views.

I started to redraft the force majeure provisions in terms of Enron as Seller 
and Southern Company as Buyer, but it quickly exceed my capabilities, so I 
went back to the language in the Enron/El Paso arrangement and included what 
I felt was the appropriate comment in the overview, to the effect that the 
Southern Company should look at the combined provisions as representing what 
Enron would, in its own right, request as a starting point for evaluation.

Once you have had a chance to look at it and my notes and definitions, I 
would like to send it on to the Southern Company for their review (sometime 
tomorrow, if possible).

Sorry to have taken so long getting this to you.


Regards.
Les

PS - please feel free to make any changes you deem appropriate.  I see little 
incentive to write up the new force majeure language until we get a signal 
from the Southern Company.  I know they are looking for simplicity and I 
think we need to be directionally responsive.  If we agree corporately, then

 I see that Phil Bair from JWorthan has responded to Phil DeMoes concerning 
the bond term.  No comments were made concerning the legal opinion for the 
legal counsel for the bond provider.  I was going to suggest that the 
contract language be modified to provide that the Company had a reasonable 
amount of time at the end of the lst 5 yr bond term to provide a substitute 
bond for the remaining term and that if the Company was able to get a 
replacement bond in place before the expiration of such period, no default 
would occur.  Can you tell from the letter that Phil Bair is proposing if 
their are any other issues that either ENRON or the Bond Provider would have 
concerning the terms of the Bond and the Customer's methods of getting 
funding thereunder.

I understand that the two of you are the key legal contacts in London on 
EnronOnline, and I thought that I should contact you regarding 
Clickpaper.com, Enron Net Works' new e-commerce initiative.

Enron is planning to launch next week (with a formal launch in connection 
with Enron Corp.'s analyst meeting on July 25) of a website for Enron's 
trading of pulp and paper products.  The business model is similar to that of 
EnronOnline, but since this website will have a more targeted audience, we 
can expect a broader product offering and greater volumes than is currently 
traded on EnronOnline.  It is anticipated that the site will ultimately have 
global counterparties and will trade physical products at several ""hubs"" 
around the world, although operations will initially be more or less limited 
to the U.S. and Canada.

I understand that the London office has done substantially all of the legal 
work associated with enabling global counterparties to trade on EnronOnline 
(such as adopting appropriate password applications and electronic trading 
agreements and addressing legal issues associated with electronic trading of 
financial and physical products).  While much of that work will be 
transferable to Clickpaper, there may be some unique issues.

I'm not sure if anyone has discussed how to handle the legal work for 
Clickpaper as it expands into European markets, but I thought that I should 
raise the issue.  I don't expect a huge volume of work immediately -- it will 
probably trickle in as the traders expand their operations -- but at some 
point it could become a substantial effort.

I would appreciate any thoughts that you have.

1484,"Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the

  I am writing about a student of mine who is on the job market
this year.  When you stopped by my office, about 18 months ago
you asked if I had any students that might be appropriate for
your group.  Although I didn't at the time, now I do.  This student has
excellent technical skills, including an M.S. in Statistics
and a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academic
year.  His dissertation research is on the investment behavior
of Independent Power Producers in the US.  As a result of research
assistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very well
and is familiar with the other ISOs.  I think he would be an excellent
match for you.  The only problem is that he will probably have many
other options available.  However, I definitely think he's worth a look.

1. Finalize the methodology proposed (Research/Market Risk)

 - determine the time period used to calculated forward-forward vols vs. 
correlations (20 days vs. 60 days)
 - stabilize the calculation for curves and time periods where the curve does 
not change based on historical prices, implying volatility of 0%

2. Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of the

Truckers still waiting for signs of pent-up freight demand; earnings 
shortfalls, layoffs loom 
If you are waiting for trucking to kick-start the nation's economic recovery, 
pull up a chair and wait awhile. Trucking CEOs say they haven't seen this 
slow a first quarter in a decade. 
""Perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since Swift became a 
public company in 1990,"" Phoenix-based Swift Transportation Chairman and CEO 
Jerry Moyes said. 
The first-quarter trucking mantra historically has been this: everybody loses 
money in January, hopes for a break-even February and earns whatever profit 
there is in the quarter in March. That formula may not hold this year. 
Gregory L. Quesnel, president and CEO of Con-Way Transportation Services and 
Emery Worldwide parent CNF Inc., said the current slowdown was first detected 
late in the third quarter last year and has become ""more pronounced in each 
successive quarter."" March, he said, has been ""as disappointing as the first 
two months this year."" 
Layoffs already are occurring at the major LTL carriers. Yellow Freight 
System has idled as many as 1,000 Teamsters and hundreds of white-collar 
back-office workers. Most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls 
that will cause them to miss analysts' first-quarter estimates. But there are 
deeper fears, too. Marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy. Small, 
family-owned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms 
because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing 
some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years 
ago. 
Swift's volume drop-off began with shipments originating on the West Coast in 
January and February and it is continuing in March, Moyes said. Coupled with 
reduced demand from the Southwest, Moyes said Swift will not meet analysts' 
first-quarter earnings expectations. Swift is not alone. 
""We hauled less freight in February than February a year ago,"" said Bob 
Hammel, executive vice president of Pittsburgh-based Pitt Ohio Express, a 
leading privately held Eastern regional LTL carrier. ""The slowdown in 
manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous. Nobody 
anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off."" 
Even Con-Way, the most profitable LTL operation in the past five years, said 
it would have a decline in first-quarter operating income compared with the 
year-ago period. Con-Way's tonnage declines were estimated in the 
""mid-single-digit"" percentage range. 
Roadway Express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to 
11 percent below those a year ago, which will result in an approximately 
one-half of 1 percent (0.5 percent) decline in its operating ratio. (see 
sidebar) 
Pat Hanley, Overnite Transportation's senior vice president and chief 
financial officer, said freight figures were flat in February year over year 
but rose slightly in March. Overnite is the exception to the LTL industry 
with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year. 
""January was pretty good to us, but February was flat. It's coming back in 
March. We're probably up in low single digits, 3 to 4 percent. We're picking 
back up. The economy has hurt us. If you had asked us at the start of the 
year, we'd have said we'd be up double-digits,"" Hanley said. 
The national economic picture is ""a big concern,"" Hanley said. ""We're not 
seeing pressure on prices, at least not so far. We're seeing customers ship 
10 pallets a day instead of 20. The shipment size is coming down. Certainly 
we're concerned. We'll do O.K., but not as great as we'd like."" 
Forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever 
stars align in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's world. The 
genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking, which 
is always a first-in, first-out industry in any economic slowdown. 
To hear trucking industry leaders tell it, get comfortable with beans and 
franks for dinner. It's going to be awhile before it's filet mignon time 
again. 
Shippers see what's happening as well but say it's still too early in the 
year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks. 
""All the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business 
levels -- definitely slower than early last year,"" said Bill Huie, assistant 
vice president of corporate transportation for NCH Corp., Irving, Texas. 
""With a couple of exceptions, carriers we talk with have no plans for 
expansion in the next few months. We are getting feelers about some possible 
lane adjustments to boost revenue. But generally it appears a little early in 
the economic downturn for much price movement."" 
The national LTL carriers are seeing the same things. ""Our business is down 
pretty substantially for the first quarter,"" said Roger Dick, spokesman for 
Yellow Corp., parent of Yellow Freight System and two large regional LTL 
carriers, Jevic Transportation, Delanco, N.J., and Saia Motor Freight, 
Duluth, Ga. 
USFreightways Corp., citing what it called the nation's ""serious economic 
slowdown,"" said it expects first-quarter earnings to fall ""very substantially 
below"" current Wall Street consensus. 
Extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating 
environment, USF Chairman, President and CEO Samuel K. Skinner added. 
""Traditionally, the first quarter builds momentum slowly, with March being 
the strongest month of the period,"" Skinner said in a statement. ""This year, 
the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in January 
and February, softening even the normal modest expectations for those two 
months."" 
It's not just the LTL industry that's hurting. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand-supply 
relationship since analyst James J. Valentine began tracking the data in 
April 1994. Two events can cause weakness in the index, according to 
Valentine. They are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak 
freight demand. 
""So far in 2001, we have seen the confluence of both factors, but the 
fall-off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply,"" Valentine wrote 
in his most recent ""Trucking Snapshot"" for early March. 
Year-to-date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over 
year, according to Valentine's index, while supply is up only 7 percent. That 
would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was 
""masked by the strong economy,"" Valentine says. 
In a more ominous note, Valentine believes overcapacity will continue to 
plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years. Only a 
reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand-supply back in balance 
for the truckload sector in the near term, Valentine predicts. 
The overproduction of new Class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last 
year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at 
manufacturers, wholesalers and other retailers. Used trucks have lost on 
average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months. 
Anecdotally, one used truck dealer, Music City Truck & Equipment, in 
LaVergne, Tenn., is holding a ""two-for-one"" sale on three- to five-year-old 
Class 8 Freightliners. You can buy two for around $30,000, less than a brand 
new Chevy Suburban SUV. 
What that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 Class 8 truck for $70,000 and 
depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the 
books this year at $35,000. But assuming it has lost 30 percent of that 
value, it may only be worth $24,500 in actuality. For a carrier with a 
100-truck fleet, that equates to a loss of more than $1 million on assets. 
The glut may last for a while, according to Valentine's analysis. Assuming a 
three-year trade-in cycle, most of the Class 8 tractors in the truckload 
sector are just now rolling over to the used-truck market. That means that 
overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year. 
That will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business, as 
did nearly 1,900 carriers last year that either closed or declared 
bankruptcy. 
""We can see from indexes, surveys and other information available to us that 
it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in March and freight 
demands will continue to be soft throughout the month. Based on all of these 
factors, we expect USFreightways' profits for the first quarter to be very 
substantially less than published analysts' forecasts,"" Skinner said. 
In addition, severe weather conditions including an earthquake in Seattle, 
rainstorms in California and blizzards in the Northeast have added cost and 
decreased efficiencies, Skinner added. 
Expectations at each of USF's operating companies have been affected, some 
more than others. The LTL, logistics, reverse logistics and 
freight-forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a 
similar period last year, Skinner said. 
Further job cuts at USF Worldwide, its freight forwarder, would be in the 
offing as cost controls at the unit would be ""accelerated"" in the wake of the 
softening economy, Skinner said. Late last year, Skinner said the rebuilding 
process at USF Worldwide would be a two-year process. But the worsening 
economy has made that rebuilding job harder, he said. 
""We are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is, in fact, further 
impeding progress in this area,"" Skinner said. ""During the fourth quarter of 
2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001, the company has taken 
steps to increase cost efficiencies. Among these actions are a substantial 
cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force. 
These cost-control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance 
the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions."" 
In the 2000 first quarter, USF posted $22.3 million net income, a 27 percent 
rise from the $17.5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter. At the time, 
that was USF's 15th straight quarter-over-quarter earnings increase. It came 
on $608.2 million revenue, an 18.5 percent rise in from the $513.2 million 
revenue in the 1999 first quarter. Analysts had been estimating USF to earn 
about $3.50 a share earnings for 2001, compared with actual $3.61 earnings 
per share for all of last year. In the fourth quarter last year, USF earned 
$23.7 million, or 91 cents a share.

                   However, it still indicates a contracting
                   manufacturing sector.
Leading            The index of leading economic indicators
economic           rose 0.8% in January, while
indicator          MSDW had forecast a 0.6% increase. This
                   represents the first rise in four months.
Stock              After a recent pullback, trucking stocks remain
perfonnance        up year-to-date with TL stocks up 5%, regional
                   LTL stocks up 9% and national LTL stocks up 13%.
Investor           For the week ended February 28, mutual fund
                   outflows totaled $309 million, compared with
                   inflows of $2 billion in the prior week.
Market             Implications
MSDW [*] truckload Negative for all TL carriers.
freight index
Diesel prices      The downward trend is Positive for all
                   carriers, especially TL carriers, which have
                   greater exposure to fuel than LTL carriers.
WTI oil            Negative for all carriers, as $25 per
                   barrel is still 25% higher than the $20 per
                   barrel average since 1990.
Capacity           Negative for TL carriers, not a major
                   concern for LTL carriers, which measure
                   capacity by the number of terminals.
GDP                Negative for all carriers.
Retail sales       Negative for both TI and LTL carriers.
Consumer           Negative for all carriers
confidence
NAPM               Negative for all carriers.
Leading            Positive for all carriers.

indicator
Stock              Positive, however, stocks could pull
perfonnance        back further in the short term as

Today's focus: News from Storage Networking World

By Anne Skamarock

As Storage Networking World gets underway this week in Orlando,
Florida, my e-mail has been overflowing with press
announcements from the conference. Among some of the more
interesting news is Compaq's introduction of two network
storage products and Brocade's launch of a 16-port switch.

Not one to sit still for long in the storage market, Compaq has
unveiled Universal Storage and the Enterprise Virtual Array
(EVA), the first product to incorporate the vendor's VersaStore
technology. EVA allows users to aggregate storage into
multiple, virtual pools that can be expanded in real-time.

EVA allows customers to define the data protection requirements
for each of the virtual pools on a pool-by-pool basis.
Traditionally, once the data protection, or Redundant Array of
Inexpensive Disks (RAID) level is set for a disk subsystem,
that protection must be used throughout. The V-RAID (Virtual
RAID) capability in the EVA allows the protection level to be
specified for each pool.

Included in the EVA is the ability to produce snapshot copies
of your data. EVA supports the traditional ""Snap"" capability
whereby storage space is pre-allocated to create the copy. The
technology also supports V-Snap, which uses space as updates
are made to the data. Finally, EVA supports what Compaq calls
""Snapclones."" Snapclones are similar to traditional snapshots
however, instead of having to wait for all the data to be
copied, applications can access the Snapclone immediately after
the Snapclone call. This makes performing backups of changing
data significantly easier and faster.

Compaq's other announcement, Universal Storage, is not a new
concept as EMC is offering the functionality too. Very simply,
Universal Storage allows customers to manage all their storage
in a storage-area network (SAN), whether the data is being
accessed directly by an application via block-level transfers
through a server, or by a network-attached storage appliance
connected to both the local network and the SAN. As with the
EVA, Universal Storage gives customers flexibility in managing
their current storage resources as well as scalability when
more storage resources are required.

Finally on the storage-networking front, Brocade announced a
16-port switch, the Silkworm 3800. The 3800 brings together
Brocade's third generation ASIC technology that supports 2G
bit/sec speeds, as well as new Advanced Fabric Services. The
fabric services include hardware enforced zoning for greater
security; inter-switch trunking for greater performance and
reliability; plus improved performance and health monitoring.
The latest version of Brocade's API is available for storage
management software vendors.

There are many, many more announcements that came across my
desk this week and I could write about them for days. However,
I found these especially interesting.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Ongoing Legislation to Protect The Electric Power Industry to be discussed at CBI's Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry Conference

 Woburn, MA, January 30 2002--  Last night in his state of the Union Address President Bush had mentioned that they have found diagrams of American Nuclear power plants and water facilities in terrorist camps. The ""Attack on America"" on September 11th and subsequent developments have necessitated a quantum shift in Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry.  The threat and scope of malicious and purposeful sabotage today is much greater than that of natural disasters. Therefore, the Center for Business Intelligence has developed the ""Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry"" conference.

Power industry executives will examine the impact of heightened security measures on their companies' day-to-day operations.  Crucial factors that will be discussed include strengthening data security and protecting against cybercrime.  The planning and creating inherently resilient infrastructures and assisting policymakers in developing adequate legislation to safeguard the nation's energy supply and distribution.  Hear about Security measures that these industry leaders are adopting: Utilicorp United, Inc., Rochester Gas & Electric Corporation, PEPCO, National Regulatory Research Institute, National Association of Regulated Utility Commissioners, Electric Power Research Institute and many more.

Representative Jeff Morris of the Washington State Legislature and Chair of the House Telecommunications, Technology and Energy Committee will keynote at CBI's Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry. http://www.cbinet.com/events/PB231/index.html  The Federal Bureau of Investigation will discuss how Houston's National Infrastructure Protection Center benefits the energy industry.

1655,"Folks,

This note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress 
toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line 
of products.  

It is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane 
warning frequency and/or duration.  It is our objective to develop derivative 
products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this 
exposure.   We have generated a partial brainstorm-style list of whom natural 
counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure:

Pro-Hurricane     Anti-Hurricane
The Weather Channel    Resorts
Home Depot     Cruise Ships    
Lowes      Riverboat Casinos
CNN      Chemical Plants and Refineries
Local TV Stations    U.S Armed Forces
Dry Ice Manufacturers    Athletic Teams
Chainsaw Manufacturers   City Governments
Insect Repellant Manufacturers   State Governments


It is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is 
important to note that the pro-hurricane entities are more macro in nature 
while the anti-hurricane entities are typically more regional.  Thus, we have 
documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the 
thought that the anti-hurricane entities would be interested in regional 
products and the pro-hurricane entities would likely be more interested in 
bundled regional products depending on their exposure.

Thus far, we have collected and documented all U.S hurricane warning data 
from 1980-2000 in the form of an Excel database.  The data can be sorted by 
year, storm, or location on the U.S coastline.  Total hurricane warning 
duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary 
data sets of interest for any given location (or year or storm).  The U.S 
coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly 
similar size.  These regions are: New England, Mid-Atlantic, Virginia, North 
Carolina, Georgia/South Carolina, East Florida, West Florida, Florida 
Panhandle, Orleans/Miss/Bama, Lousiana, and Texas.

While this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes, it 
has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration 
is quite volatile and unpredictable.   It is believed that this volaility, 
when graphically depicted and mathematically represented, could be used to 
effectively demonstrate to would-be customers the impact of hurricane warning 
frequency on their business financials.  In many cases, businesses may be 
well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly 
probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves.

As we move forward on the modeling front, the data will certainly need to be 
scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends, 
satellite availability, population trends, etc.   Additionally, we need to go 
further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn't decline.

On the marketing front, I am certainly open to ideas.  It is believed the 
Weather Channel would be the most natural party for such a product.  Given 
our positive relationship that we currently have with them, they might be the 
easiest sell.     Any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when 
we should approach customers.

Please respond with any questions, comments or concerns on this project.


Thanks,

Charlie

1694,"Hi John, as per our discussion and e-mails, I am suggesting the following 
dates for the subject offsite:  April 14 & 15 th (Friday & Sat).  Place and 
agenda to follow once this date is nailed up.   The heads of each group will 
decide who will attend.  We would also invite Kevin Hannon, Scott Yeager, Tom 
Gros, Ted Seitz and Jean Mrha once the dates and agenda are agreed upon by 
the Technical folks.

As before, the idea is to introduce the two of the most technical groups 
within Enron and to exchange ideas and issues.  The Enron research team will 
provide trading and modeling presentations and the Optical Network 
Engineering team will present networking and components related topics.

Take away from the two days will be to provide John Griebling's group with 
better understanding about how the trading markets have developed in general 
and energy markets in particular via Enron (i.e.,  how the sausage was 
made!).  Likewise, John's group will provide us with better understanding of 
optical networking from a technical perspective.  Particularily, how EBS is 
planning to develop the Puplic Switched Optical Network (PSON) that John has 
'branded' our pooling point based network!

Please reply ASAP if these two days (April 14 & 15) will work.  Additionally, 
John, is the original suggestion to hold it in Scott Yeager's cabin somewhere 
up in Colorado mts. still holds?  If yes, I should probably let Scott know!  
If not, I'll try to find other places--any suggestions, anyone?

The following topics would be of interest to EES:

1 -  The derivation of default probabilities including  (Research)
 - - a discussion of the actual mathematical process,
 - - the analytics behind why these computations are deemed the best for 
Enron,
 - - a comparison to historic default rates and why they differ (in respect 
to actual default rates, shape of the cumulative default curves etc.

2 -  The volatilities which are used to determine possible loss scenarios for 
the commodity portion of EES deals including (Research)
 - - the selection of curves
 - - the application of those curves to the actual credit reserve model and
 - - why these particular tests are applicable to our products.

3  -  The recovery rates used in the credit reserve model.   How are these 
figures derived? (RAC)

4  -  How RAC and Research have adjusted the credit reserve model to 
accommodate unusual aspects of the deal including  (RAC)
 - - promotion payments,
 - - accounts receivable
 - - committed capital
 - - and other factors

1720,"Dear Vince

I am currently producing Risk 2001 Australia (Risk and EPRM magazines'
annual Australian derivatives and risk management congress) which is taking
place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001. I understand that you spoke at our
Australian Energy Risk 2000 conference last year.

I have now put together the draft programme and I am at the stage of
inviting people to speak at the event in August. I would like to invite you
to speak at this year's congress and I attach a copy of the draft programme.
I particularly had in mind the presentation 'Case study: learning the
lessons of the Californian electricity crisis - could it happen here?' (talk
number 7 in stream three of the programme which focuses on pricing, trading
and risk management in the Australian energy markets). However, if there is
another topic that you would be more interested in presenting then please
let me know.

This year's event combines last year's Australian Energy Risk 2000 and Risk
2000 conferences to create Australia's most comprehensive risk management
and derivatives congress. This year the congress will also include two
one-day post conference seminars on 22 August. Should you require any
further information about the programme or the event generally, please don't
hesitate to contact me either by telephone on +44 20 7484 9866 or by email

1721,"I know, Zimin. It was/is an honest mistake, and I am hurting from it. It does seem that things have worked out, and that the issue has been resolved with Larry May and John Griffith. Additionally, I have been in touch with Jeremy Wong to ask that the ERMS coding be updated, and have been in communication with Eric Moon (Gas Structuring) to make sure that the structurers are aware of the changes made. Eric told me that they have always used the OSTRIP function for fixed price options in the manner which is correct by the documentation.
 
Paulo suggested that I find out if there are any power traders who use the function and alert them. I asked Alex but he didn't know of anyone. I also talked to Iris, but she didn't know of anyone either, although she did say that they have priced strips on the power desk before. Would you know of anyone who uses this function on the power desks, so that I might contact them? Thanks.

1724,"Ben and I have been discussing the possibility of getting more dedicated 
support from Houston on our project.  We are wondering what the possibility 
is of having either Amitava or Vasant come over for 8 - 12 weeks to help get 
things jumpstarted on the the credit scoring and modeling front as well as 
provide some guidance on the CLO part of the business and potentially hiring 
an additional  full time resource.  If there is any possibility, it would be 
hugely valuable given the long lead times to get someone from the City in and 
integrated in addition to the significant cost.

1725,"We have established a set of power volatility curves down to the EFA/monthly 
level of detail that can be marked to market up to 6 years out.  Beyond this, 
the volatility decays to what we understand to be the long-term level for 
power volatility, given our understanding of the behaviour of forward prices 
over large time-scales.

The swaption traders can now fit the first 5-6 years of the volatility curve 
to the market-observed baseload swaption implied volatilities (typically 3 to 
12 months duration for the underlying swap) and then be in a good position to 
price other swaptions (including swaptions on individual EFA slots) 
consistent with the curve.  There may also be an impact on the daily VaR 
calculation.

An illustration of the current volatility curves is pasted below:-




These curves will be reset as the market moves, and allow a mark-to-market 
approach to be followed for our volatility book.  The spreadsheet model is 
saved in T:\READWRTE\ELEC_UK\MODELS\VOLCURVEGENERATORNEW.XLS and also 
attached below for Houston staff to review.

I haven't missed anything, thanks.]

1726,"Bryan,

We shall be glad to  take a look at the system. To sign - off on the vendor 
provided system we
have to look under the hood and review the algorithms. I hope the vendor will 
have no objections to it.

Another critical issue we have to solve on a short notice is to integrate the 
system you want to buy
with the rest of VaR/credit systems. We shall stand by to help in this 
endeavor.

An alternative approach is to evaluate to what extent your positions can be 
rolled into the existing risk systems.

Thanks for a prompt reply. I am not planning any particular trip to Houston
yet. For the time being, I am about to leave for London, and then Poland. I
will most likely be at the Olympics in Sydney in late September, and in NY
in early October. Mid-October could be the first realistic opportunity to
visit with Enron, although I am looking forward to seeing you sooner in Palo
Alto. I am simply curious whether and how we could leverage together core
competencies and connectivity that both our companies seem to have or are
developing.

I am Senior Vice President for Visa USA, responsible for strategy and

			Energy Experts Belie Davis' Rosy Prediction
Summer expected to be crunch time

Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief 
			?
			Wednesday,?February 28, 2001 
			
			
			
			
			
			

			
			Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis' optimistic assessment that California may be 
on the ""back side"" of its energy crisis flies in the face of what many energy 
companies and other experts predict. 
			California's real test will come this summer when electricity usage sharply 
increases, and unless everything breaks the way Davis hopes, predictions are 
that large chunks of the state will be in the dark. 
			""We're not on the back side of this crisis. This problem is far, far bigger 
than the governor is suggesting,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive director for 
the Western Power Trading Forum in Menlo Park. 
			""To characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on the 
popular notion we don't have an energy crisis. We do. We have a very serious 
one that's going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up,"" Ackerman said. 
			The Democratic governor's comments were made Monday in Washington, D.C., 
during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street 
support for his energy plan. 
			He admitted more hard work is needed, but said the state is on the ""back side 
of the crisis"" because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower 
electricity prices. 
			""Does that mean we're home free?"" Davis asked yesterday. ""No."" 
			But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis. 
			That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator, which 
oversees the state's power market. 
			On any given day in June, the ISO estimates, the state will fall 6,815 
megawatts short of demand. That would put nearly 7 million homes in the dark, 
if it happens. 
			In July, the expected shortage is 4,685 megawatts. In August, it's 5,297 
megawatts. That's if California has a normal summer. If it's hotter than 
normal, the shortage grows. 
			The ISO's estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis' 
conservation goal. 
			But even if a 10 percent reduction were achieved in June that would save 
roughly 5,000 megawatts, the state would still be short 1,800 megawatts. 
			And there are other variables. 
			Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels, hydroelectric plants may not 
be able to run at full bore, which would also worsen the situation. 
			""That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of,"" said Sen. Tom 
McClintock, R-Northridge. 
			Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will 
help the state get through this summer. 
			The clock is running. The ISO predicts shortages of 3,030 megawatts in May - 
- just two months away. 
			""The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer, and I don't think 
we've made enough progress there,"" said Severin Borenstein, director of the 
University of California Energy Institute. 
			California won't be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quickly 
approving and building new power plants, Borenstein said. 
			The ISO's demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to come 
online this summer. 
			""Unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then and 
now,"" Borenstein said, ""we are going to face some serious shortages."" 
			Like Davis, Borenstein says California needs to do more to conserve energy. 
Unlike Davis, he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them an 
incentive to cut back. 
			But the Democratic governor may be sending Californians a mixed message. 
			By telling them the worst is over, he could undercut his plan by making 
people believe more conservation is unnecessary. 
			Excluding what lies ahead, there are also plenty of energy issues left 
unresolved right now. 
			Although Davis has reached a tentative deal with Southern California Edison 
on purchasing its share of the state's transmission system for $2.7 billion 
-- no such deal exists with either Pacific Gas & Electric or San Diego Gas & 
Electric. 
			Some alternative energy producers, like co-generation plants, are shutting 
down because the cash-poor utilities haven't paid them for several months. No 
cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice. 
			Generators like Duke Energy and Reliant Energy aren't convinced the crisis 
has passed. 
			For starters, both companies are owed in excess of $700 million for 
electricity bought by PG&E and Edison but never paid for. 
			""There are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your state 
will require this summer, whether there is enough generation on the ground or 
available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike in 
demand,"" said Richard Wheatley, a Reliant spokesman. 
			Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, 
has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over. 
			""We've said all along it's a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities 
and the energy companies,"" Rosenfield said. 
			""Now that taxpayers are paying $1 billion every three weeks to buy 
electricity and the ratepayers are going to pay between $13 billion and $20 
billion, the companies are happy and the crisis is over. What more could they 
want?""

Working on transition of phone operators into our group.  Fast tracking their 
physical relocation onto EB level 4.
Working with ECM and RARC on Enron Field Parking Garage project.  Have been 
advised that Joe Sutton or Jeff Skilling will have to approve DASH.  May 
require a meeting with one or other to explain.  I'm scheduled to meet next 
Wed. with Billie Birge of Sports Authority and Bob McClaren of Astros to 
discuss Garage deal and get Sports Authority support.  We have kicked off the 
design team to finish construction documents, having shut down work for last 
6 months, in order to meet our proposed May 1st construction start.
Finalising lease amendment with Trizec Hahn to add another 30,000 sq. ft. of 
space in Three Allen Center (short term 2 year deal).  The proposed space has 
already been sold internally.  Gene Humphrey's group and George Wasoff's 
purchasing team will be main occupants.
Finalising sublease with Azurix to obligate them to 3 floors of Three Allen 
Center throughout balance of our six year term.  They have asked for rights 
to keep the Allen Center Garage ""reserved"" parking spaces for Rebecca Mark, 
Bazelides, and Amanda Martin.  Our response is that they can keep reserved 
stalls until such time as Azurix's Board of Directors is no longer controlled 
by Enron.  At that time we may require they give up these reserved stalls and 
if so, be given reserved spaces in basement of Three Allen Center building 
(perceived as slightly less desirable).  Reason being that the Allen Center 
Garage ""reserved"" parking spaces came to Enron as a result of the original 
Enron Building lease in '85.  The three floors of office space they occupy in 
Three Allen Center is not significant enough to command reserved Allen Center 
Garage stalls.  However we will review next year once Enron Center's new 
garage is complete and we find that demand for reserved Allen Center Garage 
spaces is not strong.  If this is case, they can have spaces through 5 year 
balance of their sublease - regardless of Enron's ownership position with 
Azurix . 
Azurix's use of Enron's aircraft is still an open issue (time share agreement 
has expired last month and Azurix is currently not using our planes).  Azurix 
definitely does not want to take a partial ownership position in any planes 
but is asking to continue the ""time sharing"" relationship in which we can 
only recover 30-40% of our gross cost, depending on plane used.   They are 
proposing to cap usage around 100 hours per year, i.e. $500K gross cost which 
equals a discounted cash out cost to them of $150-200K.  We've asked them to 
put it in writing and we will review with Enron management.  
Mike Hicks and I are meeting with Don Hawkins next week (reports to Kurt 
Huneke) to better understand Asset Management's expectations of Corporate 
Security.  E-mailed Control Risk our list of preferred Security Contractors

Glynn:

Adding Enron's ""negative CTC claim"" to the list of claims: PGE's filing 
included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was 
apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is 
nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on 
April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured 
claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and 
state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as 
uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the 
claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the 
court determines the validity of the claim).
Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity 
to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several 
reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) 
we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the 
real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as 
significant creditors but are really just ""passthroughs"" for the suppliers 
... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on 
the creditors committee anyway).",Glynn,,Enron CTC PGE PG&E the Creditors' Committee PX ISO

Can we tone down the demand-side management language.  Our short-term retail 
position in California is that the rate freeze by law should be maintained 
until December 31, 2002.  Of course, in the long-run we believe demand-side 
management and demand elasticity is and important tool toward managing the 
prices in California.  Perhaps you can refer to demand elasticity as a 
long-run goal or focus your discussions on demand elasticity with respect to 
the utilities' current tools in their interruptible tariffs.  Also, you could 
focus more on the utilities' new ability to purchase outside the PX.  I am 
afraid that coming out too strong on demand-side management as a short-run 
solution plays into the utilities' hands to end the rate freeze early to the 
detriment of the retail market.

the big story trend is corporate culture and what's new and different at

Aside from what you already know on the Enron de Mexico ENA regulatory and 
commercial front (in documents that I gave you), I am also supporting 
HydroMod and EBS in their efforts to materialize business oportunities in 
Mexico.

Attached you will find activity reports on these matters.

Enron de Mexico has also taken an active  role in the Bufete Industrial deal 
with EE&CC although I do not have anything to do with that.  Nevertheless, I 
should say that the One Enron approach is at work in the Mexico City office.



Apparently very soon EBS is going to sublet some space in our MX City office 
and get someone on the ground permanently.  They have been talking about the 
possibility of getting some regulatory support here from me.  Is this 
convenient for our organization?  How should we go about it?

Best,

scheduled for DEC 18 from 3 to 5pm. Prior to the meeting, I wanted to share 
some background on how this came about and why it may be relevant to your 
area of responsibility. 
During 2000, the International PR team wanted to develop a better 
appreciation as to what corporate cultures, operating structures, strategies, 
tactics and tools were being used to keep pace with the ever-widening and 
more strategic role communication is being asked to play.  As such, several 
companies got together and asked Laird & Associates ( who has previously 
completed studies for Enron) to conduct research on the following companies, 
i.e.  BP Amoco, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., 
McDonalds, Nestle, Nokia Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell Group. 
The presentation will be made by the President of Laird and Associates and 
you will receive the most important elements of the voluminous analysis and 
findings they extracted from on-site visits. For your reference, I will 
forward the final report to your attention.
The presentation will take place at the Enron in 47C1. Please feel free to

Transredes
The environmental and social impacts are currently being conducted.  
According to Transredes, analytical results for the potable water 
(transported by gasoline tanker trucks) were satisfactory.  Cleanup efforts 
continue.
Ventane
The TMR (Ventane transport company) driver and 3 of 5 occupants of the other 
vehicle were killed in a vehicle accident on 07/18.  The two remaining 
passengers are in critical condition.  Preliminary reports indicate that the 
civilian vehicle ran a stop sign and the Ventane truck hit it.
EcoElectrica, Puerto Rico
The EPA meeting has been re-scheduled for August 1. Marc Phillips is helping 
to make final revisions to the NOx modeling that indicates no ""significant 
impacts"" to the environment.  The second quarter excess emissions report was 
submitted to Ernesto Blanco (Enron C ALME) and Pete Wilkens of Edison for 
their final review today. It is due to EPA on July 28.
Dabhol, India
David Ronkainen and Henry Van met with Chris Haas (Thermoretec) and Steve 
Schwarts (ENSR) to discuss findings regarding the area's geology.  In 
Thermoretec's meeting with DPC management, all parties agreed to 
Thermoretec's installation of additional wells to better assess the 
subsurface contamination and review of historical analytical data to develop 
a proposal for remediation and the prevention of future impacts.  The final 
draft audit report has been distributed to concerned parties for comment.
MGplc Metals
Alan Stringer is working to identify the locations of metal storage 
warehouses, etc. in order to conduct an EHS review.  We have been unable to 
determine if any environmental due diligence was conducted prior to the 
acquisition.
Annual Report
Graphics Department is currently working on the layout and design.  Frank 
Smith is revising the Environmental Disclosure Statement.  Jeff Keeler is 
circulating a revised Climate Change Position statement.  No word received 
from Kelly Kimberly regarding the approval status of the Chairman's Statement 
and Social Responsibility statement.
Quantitative Risk Analysis
Don Stevens and Susan Worthen met with Thermoretec to review preliminary 
screens for the Quantitative Environmental Risk software currently being 
developed.
ENEL, Nicaragua Due Diligence
The government was supposed to meet this week to determine the power 
generation privatization schedule.  Meantime, the commercial team is 
re-evaluating to determine potential value.  If project proceeds, due 
diligence could occur between August 1 and end of September.
PEP, Panama Due Diligence
Enron is looking to exercise its option to purchase the PEP power plant, 
located within the boundaries of the existing BLM facility.  An environmental 
due diligence was conducted approximately 2 weeks ago.  Donnie Willmann is 
meeting with Rene Van Horde (BLM Plant Manager) to discuss ambient air 
quality impacts and needed modifications should we purchase the PEP 
facility.  

MTBE Legislation
Draft legislation has been released by the Senate Environment Committee that 
would eliminate the fuel oxygen mandate and phase out MTBE (subject to 
maintaining similar environmental benefits) and mandate use of ""renewable 
fuels"" (to get the support of ethanol).  We are working to have provisions 
included for MTBE producers, most likely in the form of some kind of 
incentives for converting to production of other additives.   The only 
possible date that the legislation could be marked up in the Senate 
Environment Committee is next Wednesday, July 26 -- that is not very likely, 
so consideration of the legislation may slip to September.
Pipeline Safety
There has been a great deal of activity in the Senate and House trying to 
negotiate solutions that would allow the legislation to move forward this 
year.  In the Senate, the McCain legislation that passed out of the Senate 
Commerce Committee must be fixed to industry's satisfaction in several ways 
before Majority Leader Trent Lott will allow the bill to be taken up on the 
Senate floor.  In the House, we are working with House Transportation 
Committee Democrats and Republicans on development of bi-partisan legislation 
(which will be much less onerous than the Senate bill) that can be introduced 
and quickly moved through the House.   Action on both sides will likely take 
place in September.
Clean Air (State Implementation Plans for NOx)
Tennessee:   Originally, the state's SIP allocated sufficient allowances for 
TVA and Enron generating facilities (Brownsville, Gleason peakers).  The 
state air regulatory agency has just advised us that they have re-drafted 
their SIP and reduced the amount of allowances they will give Enron by 75%.  
We will be working actively to have our allocation restored to workable 
levels.
Illinois:  Enron has organized a meeting of other IPPs next week in Chicago 
to coordinate advocacy efforts on the Illinois SIP, in which the current 
trend is to allocate allowances to existing generation and disadvantage 
newer, cleaner generation.
Alberta Power Purchase
Jeff Keeler's group have been asked to provide detailed analysis of the 
potential effects of environmental regulations on an ENA Canada power 
purchase deal involving several older coal generation assets in Alberta.  We 
have provided regulatory information, and are assembling data on the possible 
costs of emissions control options that could affect prices in the future 
under several different regulatory scenarios.
California Reporting Error
We have been working closely to deal with an error in the data EES submitted 
on their 1999 annual report to the California Energy Commission and the 
Center for Resource Solutions (the agency that administers the Green-E 
program).  The error was related to reporting of a ""green"" product EES 
offered to their large commercial/light industrial customers, offering 100% 
renewable energy for the first 5,000 kwhs per month at no additional 
charge.   The error could put us in violation of requirements involving EES' 
Annual Report to the CEC, Fuel Content Label and Green-E certification.   
Information about the error is NOT known outside Enron, but we have advised 
Peggy Mahoney of EES Public Relations.   Stacey Bolton is coordinating on 
this issue with EES legal and the California Government Affairs office.

are unable to say how much of the dollars are overcharges.

schedule, both offices told us to call on Monday morning to schedule the 
call.  If Ken wants to make the calls unscheduled, we expect Armey and Gramm 
to both be in DC by Monday morning.

The numbers are as follows:

Senator Gramm  (202) 224-2934
Majority Leader Armey (202) 225-4000

Here are the talking points

** CONFIDENTIAL **

Talking Points on Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000

Background:

We have hit an impasse on the CFTC Reauthorization legislation.  On legal 
certainty, nearly all interested parties agree.  However, Senator Gramm 
continues to raise objections unrelated to legal certainty for our business.  
There are two issues (which we understand have primarily been advanced by 
Senator Gramm, one on bank products and one on SEC jurisdiction). Majority 
Leader Dick Armey is trying to gain consensus with the interested parties 
which include Senator Gramm, the Chairmen of the House Agriculture, Commerce, 
and Banking Committees, as well as the Department of Treasury, CFTC, and 
SEC.  Meetings are occurring on a daily basis, but little concrete progress 
has been made since draft legislation was released on October 9.     



Talking Points:

We need your help to resolve outstanding differences so that the Commodities 
Futures Modernization Act of 2000 can pass this year.  There are very few 
legislative days left and movement now on this legislation is essential. Do 
not let the Congressional calendar be the enemy of gaining legal certainty 
for this dynamic and growing industry.

The current version of the legislation provides important legal certainty for 
all physical commodity transactions (not including agricultural commodities) 
entered into on a counterparty-to-counterparty basis or on an electronic 
trading facility.  We strongly support these provisions.

The legislation eliminates concerns that our derivatives transactions may be 
illegal or that our online platforms may be unregulated futures exchanges.  
These provisions allow our businesses to grow and innovate.  Without this 
legislation the industry will be crippled with legal uncertainty and these 
platforms will develop overseas.  

Virtually all of the issues in this very complex legislative package have 
been resolved. We are indifferent to outstanding provisions, except to the 
extent that they impede passage of the legislation.  We cannot allow the 
great progress made to date, fail in the end.

If asked, about a possible solution to the logjam.  Answer:  Encourage 
Majority Leader Armey, Senator Gramm, and Secretary Summers to meet 
immediately to finalize the remaining issues.  Given time constraints, if 
such a meeting does not occur in the next few days, there may not be enough 
time to pass this important legislation.

Note: Congress will be going out on either October 20 or October 27.

Ken - just an update on our German Federal Cartel Office proceeding, after 
your conversation with Ulf Boge.  Our case has not yet been dismissed, and 
yesterday, took a turn for the better.  One of the two utilities, GVS, who 
had refused to shoulder their share of the cost of the economic study that 
was to produce a fair rate, has now agreed to pay their share, and it appears 
that the study will go forward, so we may still get the precedent we are 
looking for.  Apparently, they (GVS) may not have wished to be put in the 
position of being the ""poster child"" for why Negotiated Third Party Access 
does not work.  I will keep you updated on any further developments.  Thank 
you again for your intervention with Boge.  With the way things work in 
Germany, it would not be at all surprising, if after your conversation with 
Boge, the word got back to GVS that Enron's management at the highest level 
was focussing on this case, and that it should not be seen as a failure of 
the Cartel Office.  Mark Schroeder",Ken Ulf Boge Boge Mark Schroeder,,Federal Cartel Office GVS Enron

1883,"Please find attached the latest draft of the Brattle Group's recommendations 
for the Japanese power industry and the accompanying appendices.

You will find changes in emphasis and structure, which make the paper more 
convincing, comprehensive and readable. We have tried to include a global 
view of market objectives in keeping with your approach in Houston, to give 
better explanations of why our recommendations are right for Japan at this 
stage and to address potential objections from deregulation's critics in 
Japan.

In addition to its earlier content, the new draft:

includes a new section setting up the objectives of a competitive market and 
defining a workably competitive market, before making specific 
recommendations to achieve those objectives in Japan;

addresses objections by utilities, etc. in Japan to our proposals. Current 
opinions or issues circulating in Japan include: California crisis, 
discrediting of a tight pool, success of PJM ensured by lack of requirement 
to unbundle, nuclear power development;

emphasizes the need for a strong, independent regulator given METI's recent 
inability to provide clear rules to support its recommendations and lack of 
expertise in the Fair Trade Commission;

de-emphasizes final section on public policy issues to emphasize market 
structure, by merging the public policy issues into one section, placing 
reliability at the top of the list and providing alternatives to achieve 
nuclear policy issues;

proposes implementation timetable in keeping with Japanese review process;

takes a punchier, more urgent approach in the executive summary and the paper 
as a whole.

The paper will be published as a Brattle Group paper commissioned by Enron 
Japan. Much input has been provided by Enron Japan but the economic arguments 
and general approach are in keeping with Brattle's written positions and 
standards. The written style of the paper is, of course, theirs.

We would appreciate any comments you might have on the contents of this 
paper. Since we will release the paper on 15 May and will create completed 
published versions in both English and Japanese by 11 May, please send us any 
comments by the end of this week, i.e. Friday, 4 May.

international initiatives to support our arious business units.  These 
activities have ranged from specific project advocacy with the U.S.

Other than the specific project advocacy, much of this work has been

Neeper and Bilas said that they were only voting for this decision because of 
pressure. They both felt that last meeting's decision provided sufficient 
relief and provided for a investigation to address longer term problems.

Summary: 

The Decision institutes a rate stabilization for residential and commercial 
customers
 Residential: $68 through 1/1/01 and $75 through 12/31/01 for those who 
consume 500kW or less - market prices for the others residential 
 Commercial: $220 through 1/1/01 and $240 through 12/31/01 for those who 
consume 1500 kW or less - market place for other commercial

Other rate schedules: Subject to market prices

Implementation date: Retroactive to 6/1/00 - SDG&E will provide a credit for 
those customers that are eligible no latter than September 30th

The decision intends to allow for future adjustment of the kWh rate caps 
retroactive to June 1, 200 to ensure that customers in hotter inland regions 
have an appropriate level of usage cap and medium size commercial customers 
are provided relief.

The bill stabilization plan requires SDG&E to file comments, by September 30, 
addressing the implementation and transition of a Levelized Payment Plan 
(LPP) for all customers on an ""opt out"" basis. However, the procedure for the 
implementation of the LLP will allow customers to readily exercise choice, 
while those that do not exercise choice will default into the LPP.

The Commission will also further study the bill stabilization plan as to 
direct access customers. 

Revenue shortfalls are to be booked into the TCBA for future recovery of the 
net shortfall.

Senator Alpert, Assembly Women Davis, Mayor Golding , the former mayor, 
several members of the City and County of San Diego Board of Supervisors made 
a public appearance. All thanked the Commission for  having this special 
session. All supported the Wood decision. All stated that it did not  go far 
enough and insisted that all customers should be subject to the cap. Assembly

I am very happy for Mexico.  There is no perfect candidate, nevertheless the 
positive impact of finally having a change in the party in power after 71 
years is beyond our forecast ability.  At last,  we are going to have more 
checks and balances in the system with all the benefits that they will bring 
to the country  to a more democratic way of doing things.  Also with the 
checks and balances everybody will have to listen, respect and negotiate with 
others.  It's going to be fun.

For us it means:

1.  A couple of weeks ago I had a meeting with a key Fox advisor and we will 
have the opportunity to participate in the design of their energy policies, 
and as you remember,last year I worked closely with a group of PAN 
legislators (close to Fox) in helping them draft aan alternative proposal for 
the reform of the electric sector.
2. The unions did not vote for the PAN and they are the main stronghold 
against energy reform.  The PAN has no compromise with the unions.
3.  Industrials have backed the PAN and since yesterday energy reform has 
been on Fox's agenda.  He said he would not sell assets but that he would 
open the industry to private investment.  You have to start somewhere.
4. We should work very hard this summer and try to participate in the 
2000-2006 National Development Plan which is a government plan that the new 
administration is obligated by law  to create and publicize.  I will offer 
100% of my time to help them develop the energy part tof the plan.
5.  There are rumors that our friend Luis Tellez is staying as well as some 
of his undersectretaries.  Hopefully Hector Olea will stay at the CRE as well.
6.  In the medium term we could see lower interest rates for the Mexican 
economy.  Since Sunday they are down more than 3 percentage points to around 
14.7%.  Hopefully in a couple of yeares we should be well below the 10% mark 
(depending also on the U.S. rates)

In short,  all is well south of your border.  The long transition to 
democracy is over.

Best,

1901,"Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental ""anti-backsliding"" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer ""transition assistance""

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the ""transition assistance"" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a ""placeholder"" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a ""date certain"" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

     (Corrects spelling of Cheney in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Following are comments from
Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay on
speculation he may be appointed to George W. Bush's Cabinet. Enron
said today Jeffrey Skilling, the company's president and chief
operating officer, will take over from Lay as chief executive in
February. Lay said he will remain chairman.

On going to Washington:

     ``It's flattering to be rumored about. That's all those are
are rumors. I plan to stay at Enron. I plan to stay in Houston.''

     He said the appointment of his successor coincidently
occurred at around the same time the U.S. Supreme Court issued the
ruling that likely will pave the way for a Bush administration.

     ``I'm a strong supporter of President-elect Bush and Vice
President-elect Cheney, and I hope that we can start to call them
that. They are both good friends, and I have been a very strong
supporter for a very long time. I hope to continue to support them
as much as I can -- from Houston.''

The tech wreck continues

Election chaos and lousy earnings news from companies
such as Hewlett-Packard are driving down tech stocks.
But don't rush to buy yet.

By Michael Sivy

There is no constitutional crisis. The presidential
election results will probably be sorted out within a
week, and certainly long before the electors cast
their votes on Dec. 18. Though the outcome of the
bitter fight in Florida is anybody's guess -- it
largely depends on technical legal issues -- the
lawyers I know think the chances of Al Gore getting
the count he wants are better than 50 - 50.

The electoral chaos is contributing to a decline in
the Dow and an even sharper selloff in the Nasdaq,
which was down to less than 2,900 at one point on
Monday - more than 40 percent off the March high.
Also a large factor in the selloff was Hewlett
Packard's third-quarter bomb. Although sales were up
almost 17 percent from year-earlier levels, earnings
came in 20 percent, or 10 cents a share, below analysts'
expectations. They attribute the profit shortfall
partly to the effects of the weak euro, but mostly to
expenses that were much higher than H-P expected. It
appears that to reach its ambitious sales goals, the
company let costs get out of hand.

 From a long-term perspective, there doesn't seem to
be anything seriously wrong with Hewlett-Packard's
business. With more attention to cost control, H-P's
sales might grow a little bit slower -- 15 percent
annually, say -- but profits would increase just as
fast. Trading at $34 a share, less than 17 times
earnings for the coming year, a sustainable 15
percent earnings growth rate makes H-P look extremely
cheap, and some analysts rate it a value buy. More
skeptical analysts, however, think that H-P's decline
could continue for a while. And that's my bet as
well.

The problem is that the tech group as a whole is in a
powerful downtrend. In fact, the biggest and
best-known tech stocks could be the hardest hit
between now and year end. Usually, money managers and
mutual fund executives try to finish their tax
selling by the end of October. But given the recent
uncertainty, portfolio managers may continue to cut
back on their big tech positions, hurting even such
tech blue-chips as Cisco and Oracle.

Tech stocks aren't the only ones with targets painted
on them. If Gore does gain the presidency, big drug
stocks could react quite negatively. Even though it
will be hard for Gore to do much to hurt the
industry, given the hostile and divided Congress he
would face, the drug stocks have been building in a
big Bush-victory premium over the past few
weeks -- and the group would therefore be susceptible
to a psychologically based selloff.

The investment that would likely profit most from a
Gore victory is fixed-income. He would face a
Republican Congress at least through 2002, and over
the next two years the surplus could total more than
$500 billion. With a sharply divided government, the
vast bulk of this money would go to paying down the
national debt, which could be reduced by 10 percent
to 15 percent over the two-year period. And even if
George W. Bush somehow manages to hang on, the
numbers would be similar.

Paying down the national debt is wildly bullish for
long-term Treasury bonds, and would also help the
bonds of government agencies -- like Ginnie
Mae -- and blue-chip corporations. A shrinking
national debt would likely slow the economy even
more -- it's the opposite of deficit spending after
all. That could contribute to a negative climate for
growth stocks and encourage the Fed to start lowering
interest rates at the first opportunity -- probably
early next year. The case for conservatism and
diversification has never been greater.

Bad news bulls
The news may be rotten for semiconductor stocks, but investors are betting
on a rebound for leaders like Intel.

By Michael Sivy

Over the past few months, I've been warning readers that the technology
sector remains in a broad downtrend that could last well into next year.
Nonetheless, when tech stocks have been beaten down badly enough, shares of
the strongest companies can rebound even in the face of continuing bad
news, provided their long-term prospects are good enough.

Exactly that sort of bad-news rebound has occurred for Applied Materials,
the leading maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Last week I
wrote that the battered stock would remain volatile and could face a
further decline of 10 percent to 15 percent. But I concluded that the
shares were so cheap at $38.50 that the upside was 10 times as great as the
downside. That proved true a lot faster than I expected. In the five
trading days since that column ran, the stock has jumped 32 percent to
nearly $51 a share.

Admittedly, my good timing was largely luck, but the power of Applied
Materials' comeback is a signal that other leading semiconductor stocks
also may have fallen too far. As a rule, if you're considering stocks in
the midst of bad news, it's smartest to stick with industry giants that
have bullet-proof balance sheets. You can be confident that they'll ride
out whatever bad conditions lie ahead, and they may even benefit as smaller
competitors are forced to give up market share.

On that basis, I'd certainly be inclined to look at Intel. Though it's the
world's leading chipmaker, with $34 billion in annual sales, Intel has
spent the year fouling up. Among the more spectacular errors, the company
ran short of capacity because it underestimated demand last year and cut
back capital spending. In addition, glitches were discovered last summer in
Intel's turbocharged Pentium III, and many of the chips had to be recalled.

Frankly, none of those failures will have much long-term impact. Intel
remains the industry's 800-pound gorilla and long-term earnings growth is
projected at more than 20 percent a year. Most analysts see continuing
weakness in the chip market for the next six months, but see the cycle
swinging up by late next year.

In September, Intel warned that third-quarter earnings would be lousy, and
the stock fell by $13 to $48 a share. At the time, I wrote that the stock
was down to buyable levels but that it wouldn't rebound right away. Over
the next three months, Intel sank to less than $32 amid a general selloff
in technology. But after announcing on Friday that fourth-quarter results
would be disappointing because of soft personal-computer sales, Intel
rallied. On Monday, investors followed through by bidding the stock up
another $3.50 to $37.50.

Investors are clearly betting that the worst is over. And with the stock
only about 20 percent above its lows (and 50 percent off its highs), I
think it makes sense to get on board. After revising their 2001 estimates
downward, analysts expect Intel to earn about $1.50 a share next year. At
the current share price, that's a 25 P/E -- cheap for a 20 percent core
growth rate. If Intel is missing from your portfolio, this may well be your
best opportunity for years to come.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Marketplace Meditations
by Os Hillman

The Door of Full Surrender

But He knows the way that I take; when He has tested me, I will
come forth as gold.
- (Job 23:10)


I was recently sitting with the leader of a marketplace
organization as he described a question he poses to
businesspeople. ""What if there were two doors to choose from;
behind one door was the complete will of God for your life and
behind the other door was how life could be according to your own
preference. Which door would you choose?"" The struggle for most
lies in the desire to follow God completely and the fear of what
might be behind the door of full surrender. Most of us desire to
follow God, but few of us will do it at any cost. We do not
really believe that God loves us to the degree that we are
willing to give Him complete permission to do as He wills in us.

If we desire to fully walk with Christ, there is a cost. We may
give intellectual assent and go along with His principles and do
fine; however, if we are fully given over to Him and His will for
our life, it will be a life that will have adversity. The Bible
is clear that humans do not achieve greatness without having
their sinful will broken. This process is designed to create a
nature change in each of us, not just a habit change. The Bible
calls it circumcision. Circumcision is painful, bloody, and
personal.

If God has plans to greatly use you in the lives of others, you
can expect your trials to be even greater than those of others.
Why? Because, like Joseph who went through greater trials than
most patriarchs, your calling may have such responsibility that
God cannot afford to entrust it to you without ensuring your
complete faithfulness to the call. He has much invested in you on
behalf of others. He may want to speak through your life to a
greater degree than through another. The events of your life
would become the frame for the message He wants to speak through
you.

Do not fear the path that God may lead you on. Embrace it. For
God may bring you down a path in your life to ensure the reward
of your inheritance. ""For our light and momentary troubles are
achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all"" (2
Cor. 4:17).




",Os Hillman Joseph,,Christ
1972,"The last I heard, the MISO is supposed to begin offering service on their OASIS tomorrow for service starting January 1.  I wanted to let all of you know a bit about where we stand with regards to that process.

I have been working with several different folks here and at the MISO to ensure that we are ready to do business with the MISO and request service.  The MISO OASIS seems to be accepting our Tradewave Certs, so we just need to get our MISO login for their systems. Today, the MISO will be sending out logins to their systems via FedEx, and should arrive prior to 10am.  Christi Nicolay will be receiving this information and distributing it as soon as it arrives. 

Unfortunately, the MISO has been (as you probably know) cutting things closer and closer to the edge.  This login was supposed to be delivered a couple weeks ago, but they have just gotten around to sending it out.  Hopefully, we will not have any problems with it once it arrives.  As I understand it, there should be only one login set up for ""EPMI 24-Hour Operations,"" with a login of ""Enron.""  The password is currently only known by the MISO, but should be contained in the letter we receive tomorrow.

This login is a temporary one until we complete our final registration.  This final registration has been a bit more of a pain, as it has involved contractual agreements and credit obligations.  I am still working with our Legal, Credit, and AP folks to get everything set up.  Again, the MISO sent the final documents out fairly recently, and we have not had a great amount of time to review, analyze, and negotiate their terms.  Hopefully, we will have come to agreement with MISO about those items, and be able to file that final application soon.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach me at my desk (X53771) or via my cellular (713-927-4680).  Obviously, you can also call Christi (X37007) or Susan Lindberg (X30596) as well.

I am sorry to bother you at such a critical time, because I know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at Enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter. 
However, I felt like I had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following.
 
Dave Forster & I met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group. I was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual. I was allowed to move dollars but NOT allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group. Frankly, the numbers seemed pretty low. 
 
Assuming the goal is to retain key employees for Netco, I am not confident these numbers will achieve this. 
I know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company. I have asked them to be patient, not make any quick decisions, and give us a chance to see this through.
 
Dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations. As you know, mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end. The mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end. I understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available. However, because the retention numbers were based on this, they are significantly lower.
 
My intentions are not to show any disrepect to Dave by discussing this with you but I wanted to make sure my thoughts /opinions were communicated to you. If Dave has already discussed this with you, I apologize for the duplication. 
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me. I am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713-446-9669.
 
Thank you for your time.

1982,"Below is the draft of our governance which I think works.  Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.  


As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  

UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  

Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.

This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:

1.	Transitional Steering Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.
Committee Members:
Mike Hutchins (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Louise Kitchen
Pat O'Donnell
Mike Bolin
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only.
Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST

2.	Integration Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.

Time - Thursday 9:00am CST

3. 	Gas and Power Operating Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.

Proposed Committee Members:

UPDATE 1-EnronOnline energy e-trade resumes after halt.

08/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - EnronOnline, the Internet arm of energy marketing
and trading giant Enron Corp. , said Thursday that trade in its online energy
products was resuming after a brief halt at about 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT).

""Most people should be able to log on now. We've been slowly bringing it
back,"" a company spokesman told Reuters.
He said the cause of the outage was still not known.

With an average of $3.5 billion in trades every day, EnronOnline enjoys the
highest volume of all energy electronic platforms.

The company posts bids and offers for a variety of energy products, including
crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, natural gas and electricity.

Enron Corp. is the No. 1 natural gas and electricity marketer in the United
States, and about 60 percent of its transactions are captured through the
electronic platform.

ected from the discussion at the FERC meeting.

The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to s=
atisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000.  The Com=
mission  notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and it=
s neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and conf=
iguration.  The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a la=
ck of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they=
 failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or =
what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs.  The order s=
tates that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmi=
ssion organizations reflecting natural markets.  The Commission indicates t=
hat they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West.  Therefore the order requir=
es the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discuss=
ions as set out in the mediation order.  Note that these meetings will star=
t next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ.

The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope charac=
teristics of Order No. 2000.  The order finds that Southern's approach to f=
ocus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate.  The order =
states, ""We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in the=
 Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible.""  =
The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may b=
e more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market develo=
pment, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesal=
e electricity prices.  The order therefore directs the parties to the media=
tion as stated above.

The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is sta=
rting on next Tuesday.  It is a lengthier order with more details on other =
aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managm=
ent, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM.  Therefore, I am=
 attaching a summary of the order.  One of the important findings of the or=
der is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs ar=
e making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board.  The=
refore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and fi=
le a compliance filing within 90 days.

Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to 
market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 
for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $2.00/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity ""NewAlb"" that will return 9% assuming a book 
value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

2047,"SEABROOK P&L
Booking the 200 MW Seabrook position through for calender 2001 results in a 
positive $23.5 million.

For background purposes, UI has a 17.5% ownership interest in the Seabrook 
nuclear facility (total facility is 1142 MW).   The other owners of Seabrook 
are as follows:
  Northeast Utilities 40% (they are driving the sale - it is a condition on 
their Con-Ed merger)
  Great Bay Power  12% (they have announced their intention on selling)
  New England Power 10%
  Other minority owners 20% (8 small minority municipal & IOU owners)

The Seabrook facility has been on the auction block for the past 6-9 months, 
and given the uncertainty of the timing of the sale, Dana & I felt it was 
imprudent to book calender year 2001 until we knew with certainty that the 
plant asset transfer (and associated state, NRC and FERC approvals) would 
occur after 2002.  Remember contractually, EPMI's 200 MW PPA position 
terminates upon final closure of a UI sale of its 17% interest.   With 
respect to Millstone, Pilgrim and Maine Yankee nuclear asset sales, the 
majority owner drives the sale process and minority owners generally almost 
always sell their interest at the same price as the majority owner.   With 
respect to UI's 17.5%  interest in Seabrook, UI has already informed us they 
intend on selling their interest along with the majority owner.

Obviously, the plant has not yet been sold and I feel comfortable (given a 
10-12 month approval process coupled with Seabrook's politically sensitive 
location in New Hampshire) booking the 200 MW position through 2001.

ICAP P&L
Given the huge regulatory uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of ICAP 
in NE,  Dana is uncomfortable taking any of the $55 million to income at this 
time.   Basically, our opinion is that the regulatory decision will either 
result in a default price of $0.50-1.00/kW/Mo (resulting in approx $20-30 
million postive P&L) or a default price of $3-3.50/kW/Mo (loss of $20-30 
million).

The ICAP decision has once again been removed from the FERC agenda for next 
Wednesday's meeting.   This is the 3rd time that has happened in the past 2 
months and indicates a lack of consensus at FERC.   Given this FERC 
indecisiveness and the current situation in California and reliability issues 
in both the Western and Eastern US in general,  I am very concerned that FERC 
does not have the political guts to pull the plug on ICAP (or lower the 
default price to low penalty rate).

Given this regulatory situation, there is a 50/50 chance we lose additional 
money and a 50/50 chance we make additional money.   Said another way, we 
would likely use the entire $55 million in ICAP $'s to completely hedge ICAP 
through the term of UI.

In addiiton, there was a FERC ruling regarding PJM ICAP today that said 
$4.00+/kW/Mo for PJM ICAP was indeed market based and not market 
manipulated.  This coupled with FERC's lack of decision for 3+ months on NE 
ICAP makes us very uncomfortable.   The good news is we are not short PJM 
ICAP.

2089,"Our source reports the following regarding  today's developments. In sum, due to the governor's sudden panic and  resultant willingness to negotiate, all parties are in a wait-and-see mode that  makes it unclear whether or not there will be an involuntary bankruptcy filing  early next week.  Our consensus view is that bankruptcy is still the most likely outcome, but the timing is subject to the ups and downs of these negotiations over the weekend.  Creditors, especially the small IPPs are close to the end on forbearance and highly frustrated with the erratic nature of the negotiations.

The events given in this report are  chronological:
 
- The original plan proposed by Governor Davis to  the utilities this morning contained the following points:

The parent companies of the utilities would have  to return to their subsidiaries $1.5 billion.  This money was originally  tranferred to the parent companies ostensibly so that the parents could use it  to pay taxes.  However, as was revealed in the audit, this money was in  excess of what was needed for taxes in reality.
The state would purchase the transmission assets  for $3.5 billion.
It was proposed that the utilities would issue  bonds to pay for the utilities' undercollection.  These bonds would be  secured against a ""distribution charge"" added to power bills.  This money  would be collected by DWR and transferred to the utilities, thereby involving  the state, but with less than a ""full faith and credit""  commitment.

- In contradiction to preliminary reports that  appeared in the press, this plan was rejected by the utilities.  One reason  for this rejection was the low price on the transmission assets.
 
- While the bondholders pressed for further  negotiations at this point in order to see if a deal could be reached; this is  because the bondholders are less impaired than the generators. The generators,  however, demanded that they be paid the money they are owed and threatened to  move quickly toward an involuntary bankrtupcy filing.
 
- Local sources report that Governor Davis  ""panicked"" at this point.  He then offered to purchase the transmission  assets for $6 billion (almost twice the earlier offer) and pay the generators'  undercollection (which amounts to $9 to $12 billion).  Reportedly, the  suggested term of the bonds that would be used to pay for this bail-out was 15  years, which would nearly double the actual cost of the bail-out.  This  plan would be put forward as a emergency legislative bill.
 
- At this point, consumer advocate Harvey  Rosenfield entered into negotiations with the state treasurer's office.  Rosenfield threatened that if the governor managed to pass this plan, he would start a  referendum to counter it.  Rosenfield would have up to 90 days after the  emergency bill was passed to put his referendum in place.  Knowledgeable  sources advise that it would be ""very difficult"" for the bonds in the plan to be  issued in less than 90 days; therefore, Rosenfield poses a credible  threat.
 
- In subsequent negotiations, Governor Davis has  offered to purchase the transmission assets for a price of at least $6 billion,  but possibly as high as $12 billion.
 
- Senator President Pro Tem John Burton is 'very  upset' with the governor for giving in on his negotiations so  easily.
 
- Mike Florio, another consumer advocate, contacted  Gov. Davis and said that the idea of negotiating a bail-out, as it  appeared Davis intended to do, was ""ridiculous.""  Florio and the other  consumer advocates threatened to ally themselves with Rosenfield and support the  referendum if Davis pursued such a course of action.  The consumer  advocates strongly feel that the generators have to ""take a hair cut"" as part of  the solution, as well.
 
- The governor will announce later this afternoon a  ""framework"" solution identical to that we have reported previously - a  state purchase of transmission assets and an issuance of bonds by the utilities,  but with state support through the DWR.  However, the state government has  yet to reach consensus on the numbers in this framework, and it remains unclear  whether the framework will be acceptable to all parties.
 
- With this announcement, the bondholders  may refrain from an involuntary filing in order to see what the terms of the  final agreement will be.  The generators, while more inclined to file  themselves, may feel that they have put enough pressure on the governor that it  may be worthwhile to wait and see, as well.  They are interested not only  in the terms of the agreement (and particularly the amount paid for the  undercollect), but also in the terms of the long-term power contracts that the  state must negotiate.  For example, if the state is willing to purchase  power at high prices in order to placate the generators, they would be very  likely to go along with the plan.

Contact Robert Johnston (x39934) or Kristin Walsh (x39510) for questions or additional info.

Bankruptcy
Early this week, there was a closed door meeting held by the Western Power Trading Forum in Arizona.  The meeting took place outside California to avoid press coverage and allow IPPs to maintain a low profile.  Association representatives believe that regardless of what happens with the PUC vs. Utilities ruling expected on Monday, some IPPs will take the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy.   Our source expects that absent a significant last minute breakthrough, the filing will happen within the next two weeks, and ""probably"" next week.  As stated in yesterdays report, the IPPs are very low on cash and are not able to cover the debts of the PG&E and Socal.  Only three creditors are needed with uncollected debts of more than $10,000 to file involuntary bankruptcy.

Bail Out
Davis has been meeting with the chief executives of both utilities in a last ditch effort to make a deal prior to Monday's court ruling.  The most likely scenario is for state ownership of the utilities transmissions assets.  However, coming to an agreed upon price will be very challenging.   In addition, PG&E and Edison appear to have competing agendas in pursuing a bail out plan.

Brian Stanley and I discussed his proposal to consolidate the Enron America development engineers under EEOS.  As you know, there is a lot of noise in the system with respect this topic that is detracting from productivity.  I suggest that we need to make a definite decision on whether or not the ENA Tech Services Group will be consolidated into EEOS or will they remain as a separate group under ENA.  The stakeholders in this decision include the power/gas origination teams (e.g. Duran, Jacoby, Calger, etc.) the various technical groups, and RAC.  These groups should be consulted to ensure that whatever we do meets their requirements.

I have asked Brian S. to arrange a meeting when he returns from his trip on or about June 11th (with Louise on the phone) to discuss.  This will also ensure we get past some key dates in our construction projects.

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in the market.

I would like to make sure everyone stays apprised and has opportunity to provide input regarding our efforts to provide EES with physical delivery capabilities.  To this end, I would like to make everyone aware of some current obstacles and some action we are taking to overcome.

Currently, we rely on the Site Profile group for long term load forecasting and load variability at the time of deal valuation and booking.  We are in the process of beefing up this effort with the goal of increasing accuracy and scientific approach.  Michael Frazier's group works to provide shorter term load forecasts where we have current physical obligations.

The problem: we do not currently have the ability to monitor our customers' load in a close to real time nature.  As such, we cannot verify our Site Profile Group's assumptions nor can we forecast load and minimize real time physical imbalances.  Without real time metering capabilities we realistically cannot build out our physical delivery capability.

Below is a description of the efforts we are taking to address the issue:

Lloyd Will's group (ENA Fundamentals and Services) is investigating interval metering technologies.  We are getting comfortable with the technology and our ability to capture the data on ENA servers and provide the real-time wholesale desk with real time load forecasts/revisions.  This will tie-in to Site Profile and Day Ahead Load Forecasting while giving us a fighting chance to minimize our energy imbalances.    
The cost side seems reasonable to me - roughly between $5,000 - $10,000, but don't take that to the bank yet as we are still researching data transmission fees (telephone/broadband) and install costs (possible sub-contract issues will need to be coordinated with EES to maintain customer touch)
We need to now prioritize customers that we will need to install/test first.  Obviously, physical delivery customers will be our focus.  We would like to target a test customer as soon as possible. 
Legal - Very important.  On a go forward basis, we need to insure that we include contractual language that requires our customers to provide a communication line (dial-up) and access to the utility meter.  We will need to review existing contracts or work through these issues with existing customers.  I was informed that Jim Keller may have worked on similar language with commercial gas contracts.

In addition, we will be negotiating with ComEd and AEP over the next month on several issues.  I will try to incorporate balancing services as well as meter installs and meter access directly with these utilities to expedite our efforts.

What we will need from EES is focus on the contractual and educational issues as well as cooperation in our effort to identify test customers.  

In order to grow the retail business, we have to build out our physical capability - everyone will continue to hear this from me.  To that end, I am very pleased with these developments as this could provide us with a real solution to the most significant obstacle - real time consumption data.  Thanks especially to Lloyd's group in taking the lead on preparing a game plan and addressing the data collection/IT issues.  

Sean/Jim - if you could begin to prepare for the contractual adjustments we will need that would be great.  Lloyd will keep us informed as to when we can begin the actual test phase.

Thanks,

The model currently represents a terminal value of $7.5 million based upon subjective rational. We have analysed the market and economic situation thoroughly and believe it is appropriate to accurately represent the terminal value as $12 million. The rational and economic analysis is covered in the below e mail. 

I would like to discuss this with you sometime today. I will call to see if we can set up a short discussion. Let me know if you would like Vlady to participate.

2103,"So, like we were saying earlier, there is less gas flowing North around the horn at Stanfield. The outage schedule is as follow: Pine River is back on June 12, and Fort Nelson starts on June 14 until June 27 (280mmcf), then 290 mmcf off on June 29 at McMahon. If prices are not motivated to move to Malin, it will back off in Alberta, either through Gordondale, or displacing gas at Kingsgate. 

The story for the other small storage facilities on Northwest Pipeline is:
	We were told that Mist is approximately 25% full, but it has a capacity of only 9 bcf   
	Plymouth has approximately has a capacity of less than 3 bcf.

Clay is taking its gas from the Rockies. We think there is enough supply to offset any additional capacity from Sumas, so Canadian gas should not be used for injection in Clay. Clay is already about 3 bcf over last year (23.7 bcf vs 20.9 bcf, on a capacity of 54.5 bcf. Last year they were only 83% full).

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call

In reviewing the remaining schedule C, I feel comfortable releasing the Green Mountain reserve of $2.09 MM. It was held back as we waited for the development of an hourly market and an ancillary market. I feel that the inherent risk associated with the ancillaries can be captured in the curves now that we have seen a market for 3 months. The scalar risk can be reflected in the hourly scalars. As for the QSE default exposure, I am willing to absorb it in my book.

Please let me know if you have any questions,

PS.  Nice articles in the Wall Street Journal and NY Times",Jon,,the Wall Street Journal NY Times
2114,"
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

On Tuesday, January 30, 2001, selected business units within EES will be 
sharing their business and marketing plans for 2001. These plans incorporate 
the lessons learned from last's year activities. The Bear Trap program was 
initiated two years ago to help our Origination teams filter down the 
universe of prospects to those offering the best probability of closing 
deals. 

This year we will have the most comprehensive Bear Trap session ever.  We 
want you to be part of this exciting process and to broaden the relationship 
we have with you and your teams.  Come and join me on Tuesday, January 30th, 
at the Aerial Theater in Bayou Place, downtown Houston, starting at 7:00 AM 
with breakfast and continuing until 5:30 PM.  If you have not RSVP'd yet, 
please have your office call Julie Davidson at x- 36882 to confirm your 
attendance.

See you there.

2140,"Thinking about bull move, the only trade I really like is being long physical 
and short NYMEX.  If you believe that NYMEX is doing a ""buzz lightyear"" 
(infinity and beyond), the next question is where does that put the cash.  
Back in '95, Chicago cash went to $40 and merc died out sub 5 dollars.  Also, 
'95 had a huge geographic basis rift, the structural shift had Z3 trading 
about $1.50 over Waha.  On the upside, cash will suffer constraints, causing 
demand spikes. On the downside, cash shouldn't materially outpace NYMEX.

Reviewing geographic arbs and considering the east coast political 
environment (high potential for congressional intervention) as well as ok-ish 
storage, the East may be the best basis sell vs. a long west trade (Waha I'm 
uncertain about, particularly if the cold doesn't hit Texas...Chicago might 
be better given what's going on there except for the Alliance issue...Socal 
appears to be the best geographic long...PGE citygate could really rock given 
storage and increase supply competition given Alliance PL...    The 
Z6/Chicago spread is trading around $1.56 for the winter  (FH) and  approx. a 
dime in today's intra-month.   The Z6 vs. NGI-PGE/CG spread has the Jan-Mar 
around .94 cents, Z6 over. Intra-month it is trading at $2.43, PGE/CG over 
Z6   (I'm waiting on additional stats, but I think I like this trade...)

Additionally, playing the '95 scenario, we should be long every basis 
downstream of Henry and short something else, maybe NYMEX, Waha, Katy  
(notice smaller font)   I'm still reviewing economic stats regarding the 
drivers to these trades such as, Sable Island, LNG, Chippewa (Canadian 
imports) and Chicago/California storage . As well as evaluating which 
geography would be the best buy....

Preliminary trades  (let me know which ones strike your interest and I'll 
focus my analysis..)

Long NGI-PGE/CG, Short Z6
Long CNG North Valley,  Short Z6
Long NGPL Lousiana pool, short MOPS, TETCO STX
Long CGT, short NYMEX  (not very exciting, small basis)
Long Z6, short Chippewa
Long physical, short NYMEX  

Still looking, still thinking,  but gun-to-my-head....

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). ","David Oxley

Sheet 2:  Petrobras:  MTM Sensitivity in which the options shown in the Pay Out Diagram for 2002 and 2003 are repriced for each move of the forward curve.  The volatility curve is held constant.

Sheet 3:  Petrobras:  Intrinsic Value Analysis - Price Curve Sensitivities in which volatility is assumed to be zero.  This represents the value if our price forecast were 100% accurate and the structure with Petrobras were to be finalized as presented.  Kind of an area under the curves analysis.

2256,"Per our meeting today, I spoke with Sherrie about  lines of credit at 
(PaineWebber) PW.? We have about another $5 million  available with a little 
bit of cushion.? I also spoke with Rocky about how  they arrive at their loan 
to value calculations and he is going to have me talk  with the person in 
that department to walk me through it.? Regardless of  how much that number 
moves, I told Sherrie that you would like to know where it  stands at the 
time she provides the information for all of the other  lines.? I told her 
that we should have that updated once a  week.
?
I also?thought it would be good?within  the?partnership to borrow against the 
PW accounts, which include Fayez,  Cypress, Eagle, and Harris Bretall for 
some of these private investments.?  The combined gross value is at $2.5 
million so that would allow for an  additional $1.25 million to be borrowed 
at 50% loan to value.? It may be a  higher number, but with a small cushion 
that is probably a good estimate.?  I talked to Rocky about this and he said 
it would be no problem and he would  give us the same rate 70 basis points.
?
With regards to rates and the PW/UBS merger, Rocky  said that he thinks that 
he can get our borrowing rate down from 70 basis points  plus LIBOR to 20 
basis points plus LIBOR come this November when the merger is  completed.
?
I have Rocky working on much better reports, like  that which was provided to 
be by Mueller/O'Shaughnessy at MSDW.? I told him  that they needed to work on 
what they have?been providing to me.? I  have not been impressed with the 
last couple of reports he has produced so that  is why you haven't seen 
them.? Rocky informed me that?he has sense  gone out and purchased a better 
system for that purpose.
?
I also told him that I would like an update on the  performance reports that 
are run on managers, specifically ours.?  Also,?I am having him include 
managers that invest in Latin America.?  I though it would be good, since 
Robert Day of TCW has been positive about  that?geographic area.
?
With regards to any future selling of personal  Enron stock, Rocky recommends 
selling within your?retirment plan since the  taxes are deferred and 
diversify within it.? Maybe set-up some of the  managed accounts here.? I 
inquired about the Enron 401(k) plan?with  regards to any additional choices 
to be offered.? He said that he?was  in talks with the people at Enron who 
handle it, but nothing would probably  happen anytime soon.? I don't know if 
that meant he was implying a need for  a push from?Enron's upper management?
to  make it happen.
?
I know that Sherrie is working her tail off to try  and get you the July 
Financials before your trip.? I know she is planning  on staying late to get 
it completed.? I told her that you want them before  you depart on your trip 
tomorrow.
?
I think that that is all for now.

 In the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, Vice President Gore is=
=20
returning to the theme that Governor Bush=02=07s Texas has become an abysma=
l place=20
to live. It is a hard case to make=02=05Texas is today the fifth fastest gr=
owing=20
state and fifth in net influx of Americans from other states, and Mr. Bush =
is=20
one of the nation=02=07s most popular governors.
 Mr. Gore=02=07s earlier attacks on the governor=02=07s education record we=
re set aside=20
following the July release of a comprehensive RAND study showing that Texas=
=20
has become the nation=02=07s top state in achievement test scores. His subs=
equent=20
assertions about the number of Texans lacking health insurance seem to have=
=20
fizzled as well (it turns out that the number of uninsured has been falling=
=20
in Texas while rising in the nation as a whole). That leaves environmental=
=20
quality, where the Vice President and his ad writers have leveled a fusilla=
de=20
of dramatic allegations about increasing pollution in Texas=02=07s cities a=
nd=20
streams.
 Environmental quality presents rich opportunities for misleading data and=
=20
rhetoric. Measuring air and water pollution involves a host of variables: o=
ne=20
can measure pollution by emissions or by the quality of the air and water,=
=20
and measurements of air and water quality depend on the placement of=20
monitors, the use of *peak* versus average levels, and adjustments for=20
population exposure and for the widely differing health and amenity effects=
=20
of different kinds of pollution. Rankings among states are much more=20
problematic than rankings of school performance or health care, because all=
=20
states that are more urbanized and industrialized have higher pollution=20
levels. Texas accounts for 60 percent of the nation=02=07s petrochemical=20
production capacity and 25 percent of oil refining, and it is the only stat=
e=20
with two metropolitan areas (Houston and Dallas-Ft. Worth) among the nation=
=02=07s=20
top ten. Measured by simple gross quantities, Texas, California, and New=20
Jersey will have *more pollution* than most other states under any=20
circumstances; the rest of us can enjoy the products without having to both=
er=20
so much with the pollution-control challenges.
 Mr. Gore=02=07s charges exploit these opportunities to the hilt, combining=
=20
misleading statistics with a few outright fabrications to create an=20
impression that bears little relationship to reality. The charges are,=20
however, easy to debunk, and it is surprising that they been reported with=
=20
little scrutiny by a media that has otherwise grown wary of the Vice=20
President=02=07s loose ways with facts.
 The Gore campaign=02=07s favorite charge is that Houston has passed Los An=
geles=20
to become *the smog capital of the United States,* *No. 1 in air pollution,=
*=20
and *the dirtiest city in the nation.* (We will ignore Democratic National=
=20
Committee Chairman Joe Andrew=02=07s claim that Houston has become *the dir=
tiest=20
city in the world,* which was evidently uttered in a fit of enthusiasm for=
=20
the latest party line.) The charge is false. According to the U.S.=20
Environmental Protection Agency, air quality in Houston is improving and is=
=20
unambiguously better than in Los Angeles, and is also better than in many=
=20
other cities.
 The Houston charge is based on 1999 city data on ambient levels of ozone=
=02=05one=20
of six *criteria* air pollutants regulated under the national Clean Air Act=
=02=05
as measured by numbers of days of *exceedences*of the EPA=02=07s national=
=20
standard. Ozone levels are highly sensitive to weather conditions, especial=
ly=20
temperature. They have been essentially flat in Houston in recent years (an=
d=20
other southern cities such as Atlanta), but they fell sharply in Los Angele=
s=20
in 1999 due to unusually cool summer weather. As a result, Houston topped L=
os=20
Angeles (and all other cities) in ozone exceedences=02=05but its air qualit=
y was=20
nevertheless better than LA=02=07s. Houston=02=07s ozone level was 10 perce=
nt higher=20
than in Los Angeles, but its particulates level was 20 percent lower=20
(particulates are the other major component of *smog,* and according to the=
=20
EPA a far more serious health risk than ozone; there is no separate measure=
=20
of *smog*). Houston did vastly better than LA for three of the four other=
=20
Clean Air Act pollutants: 63% lower for nitrogen oxides, 64% lower for carb=
on=20
monoxide, and 78% lower for lead (the cities=02=07 sulphur dioxide levels w=
ere=20
identical). While Houston was out of compliance with EPA=02=07s national st=
andard=20
for only one pollutant, ozone, LA was out of compliance for three: ozone,=
=20
particulates, and carbon monoxide.
 We hasten to add that we are comparing Houston with Los Angeles only to=20
demonstrate the falsity of Mr. Gore=02=07s allegation. If Houston is not nu=
mber=20
one in air pollution, neither is it number two or even number six (Houston =
is=20
the nation=02=07s sixth largest metropolitan area).  According to the EPA A=
ir=20
Quality Index, which aggregates levels of all six air pollutants and weight=
s=20
them according to the health risks of each, air quality in Houston is bette=
r=20
than in ten other metropolitan areas. Houston also bests ten other cities o=
n=20
a separate EPA index of ozone alone. (These data are for 1998, the most=20
recent year available; rankings for 1999 and 2000 will probably be similar.=
)
 A related charge, and particularly egregious falsehood, is Vice President=
=20
Gore=02=07s assertion that Governor Bush *made key air pollution rules in T=
exas=20
voluntary.* In 1999, Governor Bush signed two laws concerned with=20
*grandfathered* sources of air pollution. Under the Clean Air Act and almos=
t=20
all state air pollution programs, old power plants and industrial facilitie=
s=20
are subject to much more lenient emissions standards than new ones. It is a=
=20
serious loophole that has been bad for the economy as well as the environme=
nt=02=05
inducing firms to maintain old facilities (both less efficient and more=20
polluting than new ones) for longer then they otherwise would, and leading =
to=20
protracted litigation over the difference between renovating an old facilit=
y=20
and building a new one. Under the 1999 legislation, Texas became one of the=
=20
first three states to begin closing the loophole through tighter standards=
=20
for old facilities. The step was praised by environmental groups and helped=
=20
coax Mr. Gore, who had not previously confronted the problem as a legislato=
r=20
or Vice President, to propose a national program of his own for old power=
=20
plants. (Mr. Bush has also advanced a national proposal.)
 But there was a wrinkle in the Texas initiative: the law covering utilitie=
s=20
enacted mandatory standards (which will result in huge reductions in power=
=20
plant emissions over the next three years), but the law covering industrial=
=20
facilities enacted a *voluntary* compliance schedule coupled with increased=
=20
fees for noncompliance. There is legitimate disagreement over just how=20
effective the fee-incentive program will turn out to be; there have been so=
me=20
initial reductions in the first year, apparently of about 25,000 tons of ai=
r=20
pollution, but the program is too recent to estimate likely future=20
reductions. What is not in dispute is that both the *mandatory* and=20
*voluntary* prongs of the Texas program constitute an extension and=20
tightening of air pollution controls=02=05and an innovation that powerful b=
usiness=20
opposition has thwarted at the national level and in most states. Nor is it=
=20
disputed that the use of economic incentives rather than regulatory mandate=
s=20
may significantly improve the effectiveness of our environmental laws and a=
re=20
worth a try; indeed, that is precisely the approach of the Vice President=
=02=07s=20
national proposal for old utilities, which consists not of mandatory=20
standards but *voluntary* tax incentives.
 For Mr. Gore=02=05a self-described environmentalist and reformer=02=05now =
to turn on=20
the Texas reforms and describe them as having weakened existing pollution=
=20
standards (*Bush made key air pollution rules voluntary*) is an act of=20
striking mendacity. His latest campaign ad adds a particularly ruthless=20
twist: it couples the *made voluntary* fabrication with the Houston air=20
quality fabrication to produce a triple falsehood=02=05that air pollution g=
ot=20
worse in Houston because Governor Bush weakened air pollution standards.
 The Vice President=02=07s most plenary change is that, under Governor Bush=
, Texas=20
has become *last among all states in air quality,* *No. 1 in industrial air=
=20
pollution,* and *No. 3 in water pollution.* Although the Gore campaign has=
=20
occasionally relied on newspaper articles and rankings produced by=20
environmental groups, its primary and only official source for these claims=
=20
is an EPA compilation called the Toxics Release Inventory. The TRI, however=
,=20
is not a useful measure of air or water pollution and is not a measure of=
=20
environmental quality at all. Instead, it measures *releases* of certain=20
substances that the EPA classifies as toxic=02=05and *releases* includes no=
t only=20
those that pollute the air and water but also those that are properly=20
disposed of through EPA-approved hazardous waste management and water=20
treatment practices. The agency=02=07s annual TRI reports warn that its est=
imates=20
*reflect releases and other waste management activities of chemicals, not=
=20
exposures of the public to those chemicals,* and that they are not sufficie=
nt=20
to determine exposure or harm to the environment or public health.
 So the TRI numbers cannot possibly support Mr. Gore=02=07s assertions. But=
 even=20
in their own terms, they tell a story that is the opposite of what the Vice=
=20
President would like voters to believe. Texas has always been near the top =
of=20
the various TRI ratings, reflecting the state=02=07s huge share of national=
=20
petrochemical and refining capacity. But it did not become No. 1 in the=20
overall ranking under Governor Bush, as the Gore campaign insinuates. Rathe=
r,=20
Texas was No. 1 under Mr. Bush=02=07s predecessor, Democratic Governor Ann=
=20
Richards, and it has improved significantly since he took office. The EPA=
=02=07s=20
1999 release of TRI data through 1997 noted that *Texas, the state with the=
=20
largest production-related waste managed in 1997, was also the state=20
projecting the largest absolute reduction . . . over the next two years.* T=
he=20
data for 1998, released earlier this year, shows Texas leading the nation i=
n=20
reduction of toxic releases=02=05with 43 million pounds eliminated between =
1995=20
(the first year of Mr. Bush=02=07s governorship) and 1998. The new report a=
lso=20
finds Texas leading all other states in energy recovery and waste treatment=
,=20
and second in on-site recycling. Due in part to these improvements, Texas h=
as=20
now dropped from first to fifth place in the TRI composite index.
 Environmental quality in Texas has improved under Governor Bush according =
to=20
virtually every useful measure. Here are a few selected statistics of our=
=20
own: According to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission,=20
industrial air emissions in Texas fell 11% from 1994 through 1998. Accordin=
g=20
to the EPA, ambient air quality in Texas improved for five of the six=20
national air pollutants for the same period, all Texas cities but one now=
=20
meet the national standards for four or more of the six pollutants (the=20
exception, El Paso, due to cross-border pollution from Mexico), and half of=
=20
Texas=02=07s cities are now below the national average for all six pollutan=
ts.=20
According to the EPA, Texas=02=07s proportion of rivers and streams classif=

*impaired* is better than the national average. And according to=20
Environmental Defense, which prepares a comprehensive index of water qualit=

=20
water pollution* but No. 37=02=05its overall water quality is better than i=

other states.
 Governor Bush does not get all of the credit for this record; it is also d=

The Power Company Name Recognition - Introduce Home Coupons

Make the internet profitable to households.  Newspapers advertise that this 
week's Sunday paper has coupons that will save you $100.00.

Go one step better:

Every household must eat.  Some households buy the Sunday newspaper just for 
the coupons to purchase.  Offer a Enron site where producers can post 
manufacturer's coupons on The Enron B2B web page.  If the consumer downloads 
the coupon, TPC records the transaction including the consumer's logon site 
and Zip Code.  Sell the database to the manufacturer/producer.  Ask the 
consumer if they would like direct solicitations for competitor's brand.  
Expand it to appliances and manufacturer's coupons.

Then Link local grocery/appliance stores, for the consumer, by his 
surrounding zip code.  The stores would post their price for that month's 
coupon by store zip code on the B2B.  For those stores participating, prepare 
a comparison by store also considering double and triple coupon offers and 
the consumer can make a decision where to buy their groceries.  Sell the 
download to stores for expected inventory control.

 N.H.   These CallFests focused on interoperability between multiple voice =
gateway and integrated access devices (IADs) based on the ATM Forum's Loop =
Emulation Services (LES) voice over AAL2 specification. The testing was don=
e to address provisioning and management of the IADs based on the ATM Forum=
's recently released LES EOC/MIB specification.   CallFests form a critical=
 step in the mass deployment of voice over broadband services. Testing of t=
he LES EOC/MIB specification will ultimately enable service providers to su=
pport flow through provisioning of new services.   In a network able to sup=
port flow-through provisioning, an order is entered by a customer service r=
epresentative on the top-most system, and it ""flows through"" all other inte=
rmediate systems, finally affecting the configuration of the network to set=
 up an end-to-end circuit. Provisioning is automated, reducing costs and er=

error prone as manual provisioning.   ""CallFest III and IV were largely suc=

THE WEEK/ Bull or Bear in 2002?
By Jude Wanniski

When I advised against holding equities early in 2001, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average at 11,000 or so, my bearishness pivoted on the monetary
deflation I knew almost certainly the incoming George W. Bush
administration would not address. The economic players assembled by the
President had very definite ideas on what they planned to do, but ending
the monetary deflation could not have been in their plans. They did not
even know of its existence.

My moderate bullishness for 2002 as a whole is based solely on my belief
that the administration has been impressed that neither their demand-side
tax cuts (putting money into people's pockets) nor Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's eleven cuts in overnight interest rates seems to
be working as intended. In addition, I strongly suspect there are now
enough people  --  who never did have great faith in that program  --  in
a position to surface with fresh ideas. If the economy is to emerge from
recession, fresh ideas will be needed. All the happy talk we hear about
the economic rebound that lies ahead  --  in the first or second or third
quarter  --  comes from many of the same people who a year ago believed
the tax cuts and rate cuts would have the stock market and economy booming
by now. If they do not understand the mechanics of a monetary deflation,
their opinions will not be terribly useful. Their ""fresh"" ideas will be no
better than those that failed if they do not see that the dollar has
become too strong relative to gold and commodities and must be devalued by
roughly 20%.

Investors are not really interested in whether the economy comes out of
recession or not. They want to know if the value of financial assets will
rise or fall, and then make their investments accordingly. It is possible
for the stock market to decline even as the real economy increases in the
production of goods and services. In other words, the statistics about
Gross Domestic Product that govern the definition of recession may very
well rise at some point in 2002, but without creating any excitement on
Wall Street. Remember: one of the biggest years for GDP in the last
century was 1933, a really dreadful year, but statistically a smidgeon
better than 1932. Think of it this way: If economic output falls 50% in
one calendar year and then grows 50% in the following year, there is not
much reason for celebrating. If your wage falls from $1,000 per week to
$500 per week (-50%), you will not really be that happy if in the
following year it rises to $750 (+50%).

The numbers we are looking at are not as bad as that, but if policymakers
do not deal with the monetary deflation sooner rather than later, the
DJIA's valiant struggle to stay above 10,000 will be fruitless. If the
dollar/gold price hangs around $275  --  exactly where it was before the
Fed began reeling off those eleven cuts in the fed funds rate  --  the
DJIA will have to give up a thousand points during the year. Early in
2001, with gold at $265, we reckoned the DJIA would find itself around
8500 by the end of March 2002. It got to that level earlier  --  in
September 2001  --  but only because of the increased risks associated
with the terrorist attacks. We did become bullish that the DJIA would
rebound as those risks dissolved, but noted we would still confront the
deflation, limiting any upside. Our primary job is to get the direction of
the markets right, not to pinpoint the various equity indices. But we
certainly would not be surprised to see the DJIA at 8500 three months from
now if there is no policy change.

FRIDAY FEATURE/ 2002 hangs on these
Rich Karlgaard, Forbes Magazine

Spring thaw, anyone? We all hope. But in the spirit of ""we can't get
better until we know what's wrong with us,"" let us lay the patient out on
the table and behold the odd, even contradictory symptoms of malaise:

*The U.S. appears to be awash in liquidity. At year's end its people and
institutions held a record $4.3 trillion in cash and money market funds.
Yet the economy is hip deep in its worst downturn since 1982.

*Capital spending and investment have slowed to a trickle, yet consumer
spending remains oddly robust.

*The Federal Reserve in 2001 spiked the money supply by 10%. Yet the
dollar has remained curiously strong against other currencies and
practically every commodity.

What the heck is going on? Is our economic sickness a result of
contraction or deflation? Huge question. The answer policymakers decide
upon may determine the outcome of 2002. Experts can argue the facts either
way -- and they have. Most supply-siders, such as Steve Forbes, George
Gilder, Jude Wanniski, David Malpass and Brian Wesbury, as well as a few
exotics such as Paul Krugman, have made the case for deflation. Others,
including Milton Friedman, James Grant and the Bush Administration, say
the slowdown is owed to a good, old-fashioned contraction resulting from
loose money and overexpansion during the 1995-2000 champagne years...

Whether the U.S. economy is afflicted principally by a contraction or
deflation is, literally, a trillion-dollar question. If it's contraction,
the economy will recover on its own, without further Fed intervention. In
fact, it may have begun to do so already. But if the problem is deflation,
as I suspect it is, look out. We are in for a longer siege -- for as long
as it takes the Fed to counter the deflation.

""What else?"" you ask. Open the spectrum. Get the full story from our good
friend Rick Karlgaard on Forbes.com,
http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0121/031.html?_requestid=56991. Also,

FRIDAY BONUS/ Internet Traffic Still Tripling

anything to stunt the growth of traffic crossing the Internet, according
to a Larry Roberts, one of the Internet's chief original architects and

The STOCK INDEXES closed higher on Wednesday due to short covering as
they consolidated some of this week's losses. However, both the
Nasdaq and the September S&P 500 index failed to fill Wednesday's
gaps thereby leaving the doors open for additional weakness into the
first half of June. Momentum indicators remain bearish warning
traders and investors that the sell off's from May's highs are likely
to continue.

The Dow closed higher as it posted an inside day due to short
covering. However, momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices near-term are likely. If the decline off
this month's high continues, May's reaction low crossing at 10,774.10
is the Dow's next target.

INTEREST RATES June bonds closed sharply higher on Thursday and above
broken support crossing at 99-31 thereby tempering the near-term
bearish outlook in the market. Much of today's support was due to
position squaring ahead of Friday's unemployment report. Closes above
this spring's downtrend line crossing near 100-26 or below weekly fib
support crossing at 98-07 are needed to clear up near-term direction
in the market. Today's rally turned the daily ADX (a trend- following
indicator) down signaling that the near-term trend has turned
sideways.

The CRB INDEX closed lower for the eighth day in a row and spiked
below April's low crossing at 208.87. Multiple closes below this
support level would confirm a breakout and resumption of this year's
downtrend. While lower prices are possible, I would not be surprised
to see a short covering bounce on Friday as the CRB index has become
oversold. Much of today's pressure was due to weakness in precious
metals, foods and crude oil.

ENERGY MARKETS were mixed on Thursday despite concerns over Iraq's
threats to curtail oil exports. Early session losses were tempered
after a temporary extension to the oil-for- food program for Iraq was
extended for up to six month's.

July crude oil closed lower on Thursday but near session highs due to
a late-session short covering bounce. Session lows fell short of
testing the 50% retracement level of the December/May rally crossing
at 27.51. While momentum indicators are still bearish, today's
high-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday.

July heating oil closed below this spring's uptrend line crossing
near 77.45. Early session weakness spiked below the 38% retracement
level of the December/May rally crossing at 75.66. Today's high-range
close leaves the door open for sideways to higher trading on Friday.
Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower
prices into early-June are possible.

July unleaded gas closed slightly lower on Thursday. Early weakness
led to a spike below May's reaction low crossing at 91.20. However, a
short covering rally ahead of the close erased much of today's losses
and leaves July in position to post a short covering bounce on
Friday.

July Henry Hub natural gas closed lower on Thursday after early
strength tied to spillover short covering from Wednesday faded during
the session. July is consolidating above last October's low crossing
at 3.86. Closes below this key support level would open the door for
a possible test of the 62% retracement level of the 1999-01 rally
crossing at 3.64 later this spring. The daily ADX (a trend-following
indicator) is in a bearish mode signaling that additional weakness is
possible.

CURRENCIES The September Dollar gapped up and closed higher on
Thursday thereby confirming the recent trading range breakout.
Today's rally opened the door for a test of weekly resistance that
crosses at 121.58, which marks the 50% retracement level of the
1985/1992 decline later this spring. The daily ADX (a trend-following
indicator) has entered a bullish trend mode signaling that additional
weakness near-term is possible.

The September Swiss Franc gapped down and closed sharply lower on
Thursday thereby confirming the recent breakout below key support
crossing at .5643. The door is open for additional weakness and a
possible test of weekly support crossing at .5508 later this spring.
The daily ADX (a trend- following indicator) has entered a bearish
trend mode signaling that additional weakness is possible.

The September Canadian Dollar closed higher on Thursday negating
Wednesday's key reversal down. Until September closes below April's
uptrend line crossing near .6440, the overall trend remains sideways
to up. Stochastics and RSI are neutral to bullish signaling that
sideways to higher prices near-term are still possible. Closes above
.6541 are needed to renew this spring's rally.

The September Japanese Yen gapped up and closed into new highs for
the month thereby confirming a breakout above this spring's trading
range crossing at .8425. Today's high tested the 25% retracement
level of the 2000-01 decline crossing at .8524. Closes above this
resistance level are needed to extend this spring's corrective rally.

PRECIOUS METALS August gold posted an inside day with a lower close
on Thursday. Today's loss led to a close below April's uptrend line.
Multiple closes below this support level would open the door for a
possible test of this spring's low crossing at 257.30 later this
year. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional
weakness into the first half of June appears likely.

July silver closed lower on Thursday as it continues to extend its
decline off last week's high. Momentum indicators are bearish
signaling that sideways to lower prices into early-June are possible.
July has been lower for the past three trading sessions, which could
set up a short covering bounce on Friday. Longer-term, a test of
May's low at 4.315 is possible.

July copper extended this week's decline on Thursday but fell short
of testing May's low at 74.75. A short covering bounce ahead of the
close tempered some of today's losses leaving the door open a short
covering bounce on Friday. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling
that additional weakness into early-June appears likely.

GRAINS July corn closed higher on Thursday due to end of the month
profit taking on net short positions by funds. Spillover support from
sharply higher soybean prices also underpinned the corn market.
Additional support came from growing concerns that the below normal
temps across the Midwest are slowing crop development. If those
concerns continue to grow over the next week or two it could lead to
a modest short covering bounce. However, traders are expecting to see
the USDA lower their export projection in the June supply/demand
report, which will only added to the bearish carryout level. Traders
will be watching Friday's export sales report for signs of improving
export demand.

July wheat posted an inside day with a higher close due to increased
concerns over disease in the Kansas hard red winter wheat crop and
some end of month short covering. Today's close above broken support
crossing at 2.65 tempers the near-term bearish outlook in the market
as momentum indicators have also turned neutral to bullish. I would
not be surprised to see a steady to higher close on Friday if
tomorrow's export sales report comes in at or just above
expectations.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed sharply higher on Thursday as
wet weather across the heart of the U.S. soybean belt has raised
concerns over emergence and early crop development. Fund short
covering was triggered once July moved above the 20 and 50-day moving
averages. Today's close above April's broken uptrend line tempered
the bearish short-term outlook in the market. However, it will take
closes above 4.53 1/2 to renew this spring's rally. Demand remains
strong, which continues to underpin the market.

July soybean meal closed sharply higher on Thursday and above this
spring's uptrend line thereby tempering the bearish outlook in the
market. However, closes above last week's high at 168 are needed to
renew this spring's rally. Friday's export sales report may help
provide additional strength to the meal market.

LIVESTOCK August hogs closed higher for the third day in a row on
Thursday and above the 62% retracement level of this spring's decline
crossing at 63.40. While a setback is possible on Friday due to light
profit taking ahead of the weekend, this week's rally has opened the
door for a possible test of April's gap crossing at 64.90 later this
year. Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways
to higher prices into early-June are possible.

August cattle gapped up and closed above the 75% retracement level of
this year's decline crossing at 73.83 on Thursday. Today's rally
renewed May's advance and set the stage for a test of January's high
crossing at 75.00 later this spring. Expectations for steady to $1.00
higher cash trades this week triggered today's rally. Momentum
indicators are bullish but have become overbought warning traders to
use caution as a top may be near.

FOOD & FIBER July coffee plunged below April's low crossing at 58.80
on Thursday thereby renewing this year's downtrend. Today's move to
new lows opened the door for a test of long- term support crossing at
51.70 later this year. Moderating temps across Brazil's coffee
growing region along with abundant supplies by North American
roasters and huge exchange stocks continue to weigh on coffee prices.

July cocoa closed lower on Thursday and below trading range support
crossing at 955. Session lows fell just short of testing the 62%
retracement level of this winter's rally crossing at 929. I would not
be surprised to see a short covering bounce on Friday that could lead
to a test of broken support at 955. However, momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling that additional weakness into early-June is
possible. If the decline continues, the 75% retracement level at 862
is July's next target.

July sugar posted an inside day with a lower close as it tried to
consolidate some of this week's losses. However, the door to lower
prices remains open following Tuesday's trendline breakout. While
another day or two of consolidation is possible, the door is open for
additional weakness into early-June with 832 then 808 being possible
targets.

July cotton closed slightly higher on Thursday as it continues to
consolidate above psychological support crossing at 40-cents. Talk of
lost cotton production in west Texas provided minor support. However,
beneficial rain farther south in west Texas tempered gains. The Delta
and Southeast are expected to see more rain next week with most of
the U.S. cotton crop in good shape.

FRIDAY, 1 JUNE 2001

*** Surprise, surprise - techs do just what they said they
would do...

*** Could McTeer be serious? Or is he just a comedian?
Should you go chapter 11 for the health of the economy?

*** Travel bargains...looser credit, but tighter
access...and a company you can buy for less than 5% of
sales!

Small cap stocks always out-perform big ones. You can make
100%, 500%, even 1000% with the right companies. But how do
you pick them?

We find the top small-cap companies in the fastest growing
markets: biotech, high tech and power generation. We look
for companies with huge technological advantages, proven
business models, experienced leaders, and lots of cash. We
even ask top industry experts to verify our research. Then
we'll introduce the company principals to you. That's the
Diligence project: your research service for small-cap
stocks.

Market Watch

To remind you, this section of the Daily Reckoning is
written by Eric Fry, editor of Grantsinvestor.com. Eric has
been the guest host on CNN-FN this week, 9:30 - 11 E.S.T.
But Eric is becoming a celebrity.

He'll be appearing on the FOX network's ""Cavuto on
Business"" show. It is a 1/2 hour roundtable show that
appears three times over the weekend. Saturday at 10:30 AM,
6:30 PM and Sunday at 9:30 AM. I am told it appears in the
same time slots in each time zone across the country.

*** The stock market correction has been ""overdone,""
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President, Robert McTeer,
pronounced yesterday. And we are darn glad to know it.
Unfortunately, McTeer provided no specific stock picks or
model portfolio by which to profit from the anticipated
rally.

*** As if in reaction to McTeer's ""call,"" the stock market
rallied a bit yesterday. The NASDAQ Composite gained 26
points, or 1.3%. Even after Thursday's token bounce, the
NASDAQ sits about 9% below the level it achieved last week.
And lest we forget, the struggling index is still 58% below
last year's all-time high.

*** Lately, the news issuing from the technology sector has
been so grim, that not even diehard bulls can ignore it.
""Surprising"" is the word appearing very often in the latest
batch of earnings warnings and cautionary comments from
Wall Street analysts.

*** In particular, Sun Microsystems ""surprised"" Wall Street
earlier this week by warning that its earnings for the
current quarter would be less than half what most folks had
been expecting. But the most surprising thing about Sun
Microsystems announcement was that it surprised anybody.
Sun's very own CEO, Scott McNealy, has been complaining for
several weeks about the poor ""earnings visibility"" at his
company. Investors simply ignored him.

*** As High Tech Strategist editor, Fred Hickey wrote two
months ago, ""While most market strategists, chart
technicians and analysts are proclaiming in unison that
they see a ""bottom,"" the CEOs' most-used phrase today is
""no visibility."" The only bottom they see is the bottomless
pit into which they are staring.""

*** The Dow Jones Industrials gained 39 points yesterday to
10,912 - within hailing distance of the emotionally
significant, but fundamentally irrelevant, 11,000-level.

*** McTeer's comment about the stock market selloff being
overdone typifies the new and improved Federal Reserve that
has emerged during Chairman Greenspan's reign. The
Greenspan Fed is not as focused on the stability of the
banking system or the strength of the currency as its
predecessors have been. Rather, Greenspan's gang devote
themselves to micro-managing and cheerleading the economy.

*** And why not? The Fed did such a good job of protecting
the value of the dollar - only down 95% since the Fed took
up its mission - who is better qualified to manage the
economy?

*** Would a national Chapter 11 filing be patriotic?
McTeer's hope for economic growth via debt-driven
consumption sounds more idiotic than patriotic.

*** Mitchell Securities bank analyst, Charlie Peabody
points out that even though the Fed is ""cutting rates,"" not
all interest rates headed lower. Yields are rising for debt
maturities that are longer than two years. This state of
affairs affects different types of borrowers differently,
and the news is not all good.

*** For example, people wishing to take out a new 30-year
mortgage on their home will find that rates are higher now
- not lower - than when Alan Greenspan begun cutting rates
in January.

*** Furthermore, even when applying for mortgages that are
tied to one-year rates (which are lower than they were 5
months ago), consumers usually must qualify for these kinds
of mortgages based on what their monthly payments would be
on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage.

*** Therefore, Peabody concludes, ""For every notch that
rates rise, some tier of consumer won't qualify for access
to credit, some tier of consumer will buckle under the
weight of their rising debt service burdens, and the
affordability of housing (as well as the ability to
leverage against the value of this asset) will deteriorate.
The bottom line is that the consumer's ability to sustain
this economic expansion is in the process being cut out
from underneath him.""

*** The hapless euro fell against the dollar again
yesterday. So unrelenting is the euro's decline that it is
becoming monotonous. Financial commentators are running out
of reasons to explain its weakness. By the end of the New
York trading session the euro had reached a new low for the
year of 84.5 cents.

*** BCA Research believes that the euro's weakness stems
directly from the fact that the investment capital flowing
out of the euro-zone is much greater than that flowing in.
I get it, people are buying the dollar and selling the
euro. I guess that explains it..

*** We mentioned a couple days ago in the DR that, thanks
to our unofficial recession, travel bargains abound. The
reason for the deals is that folks aren't traveling. To
judge from recent stats compiled by Dennis Gartman's
eponymous, Gartman Letter, most families' will spend their
summer vacation in their own backyard, running through the
sprinklers and grilling hot dogs.

*** Gartman states that this spring 17 of the top 25 travel
markets in the US report ""marked declines"" in hotel
occupancy rates compared to last year. In New York,
occupancy fell to 73.3%, from 84.2% one year ago. San
Francisco Bay at even worse, last year's 85.2% occupancy
rates fell sharply to 70.8% this year.

*** Not even the ""Happiest Place on Earth"" could buck the
trend. DisneyWorld occupancy rate fell to 77.8% from 84.5%
last year.

*** Greg Weldon, editor of Weldon's Money Monitor, who
brought the Gartman data to our attention, also provided a
firsthand report from DisneyWorld. ""I can say in no
uncertain terms, that while I was there last week, hotels
in Orlando were very aggressively advertising discounted
rates for the Memorial Day weekend space-with neon signs,
billboard ads and repeated radio ads.""

*** Tellingly, Dennis Gartman notes one bright spot:
""budget"" hotel occupancy rates rose 1.3 percent compared to
a 3.5% decline in ""luxury"" hotel occupancy. Consumer, where
art thou?

*** How about this for a darned cheap stock? Tenneco
Automotive - maker of name-brand auto parts - has $3.5
billion in revenues.but 73 million in losses...for the 12
months ending March 31st. At the current share price, you
could buy the whole company for $110 million. The problem
is that the company owes $1.6 billion and is in danger of
going bankrupt. It is a ""turnaround situation."" says the
CEO. Of course, if he succeeds, buyers at today's prices
will do quite well. If he fails, well, forget I mentioned
it.

MORE THEORY THAN IN FACT

Dear reader,

I return to painting - if only to introduce my method.
You've heard of 'taking a broad brush' to a subject? Well,
today, I have gotten out a spray rig - with a wide nozzle.
Using this heavy equipment I intend to put a thin gloss
over 2000 years of western history in less time that it
would take a Republic congressman to sound out the word so-
li-da-ri-ty.

The question on the floor - still lying on the carpet like
a smear of cheese dip after last night's party - is this:
why has the idea of laissez-faire economics taken hold in
Anglo-saxon countries, but not in the country of its birth?

Yesterday, I reported that French workers were entitled to
4 weeks vacation. I was wrong.

In 1981, in the name of 'solidarite,' the Mitterand
government decreed that, henceforth, every French worker
would have the right to 5 weeks of paid vacation.

There is no word in English that conveys the sense of the
French word 'solidarite."" Socialists and agit-prop
demonstrators occasionally try to use an anglicized version
of it - solidarity - but the word has neither meaning nor
emotional power in English.

""Solidarite means nothing in French either,"" explained a
very bourgeois dinner companion a few months ago. ""But it
is like the word 'racism' in English. It is used to shut
people up. No politician in France wants to risk being
'contre' solidarite.""

What a wonderful world we live in, dear reader. So full of
intricate, subtle meaning. So marvelously complex...and so
entertaining.

There is no better place for an American to enjoy this
fascinating world than in France. You don't have to listen
to people charging one another with being 'racist' - a pre-
occupation of American politics. Instead, you listen to
arguments about 'solidarite' - and you are amused.

The French still imagine that they are one people, with one
language, inhabiting one distinct place. They may have
competing ideas...but their interests are in harmony.
What's good for the truck drivers is good for all
Frenchmen. When the drivers went on strike, blocking major
highways and causing a 100-mile traffic jam, people were
overwhelmingly sympathetic. They felt the need to stay in
'solidarite' with the drivers.

America is different. It is a collection of different
peoples. We recognize that different groups not only have
different ideas, but different interests that compete with
one another. Many people might be sympathetic to truckers,
but few would feel they had a right to snarl up the entire
nation's highway system. If they have a beef it is with
their employers, not with the rest of us. Let them sort it
out themselves. Laissez faire.

""Why has the 'laissez faire' concept been lost in France,""
Mark Skousen asked his audience. ""Perhaps it is a question
of faith,"" he wondered aloud. ""Adam Smith's idea was that
things would work themselves out for the public good,
guided by 'an invisible hand.' Smith was a moral
philosopher. He saw the 'invisible hand' as the hand of
God.""

America has more churchgoers than any other developed
nation. It always has had higher levels of religious
participation. Looking around the U.S., region by region,
the higher the level of church attendance - the more likely
the voters are to favor the 'invisible hand' of the free
market over the iron fist of government. It is rural areas,
and especially, the evangelical, super-church regions of
the south and southwest that vote for the free-market. With
little faith in the 'invisible hand,' the Chardonnay
drinkers of Manhattan and latte swillers north the
Housatonic look for the hands of Hillary and Jeffords to
set their vacation policies.

Before Ceasar, the Roman Republic was a bit like the
American Republic before Roosevelt. People took their
vacations according to tradition, consensus, the give-and-
take of the market, family obligations and so forth. But
when the Republic gave way to an empire, the operating
principle changed too. Emperors began to determine the
character of life by decree. Power shifted from the clans
and families of Republican Rome to the tyrants of Imperial
Rome.

Neither the Frankish kings, Richelieu nor Napoleon could
resist the lure of Roman power. Once a Roman territory,
France became a kingdom, a republic, an empire (Napoleon
actually crowned himself Emperor in a moment of
unparalleled absurdity), and then a republic again.
Whatever, it called itself, France has always continued in
the tradition of Imperial Rome. Paris is the center of
power, as was ancient Rome, from which laws and roads
radiate outward.

All over France, mothers rock their infants to sleep hoping
that their children will do well in school and make it into
the few 'grand ecoles' in Paris and thence into a
government ministry. Perhaps they will help set interest
rates...or rig bids for Air France contracts...or determine
vacation policies. However much they might retard progress,
they will earn a good living and enjoy the feeling of
superiority that you get from being 'inside the beltway' -
at the center of power.

In America, things are not so different. But at least we
all know the regulators are morons. And women do not wish a
bureaucratic job upon their infants. Instead, they imagine
them as respectable professionals - lawyers, doctors, or
university professors - or, if they can't make it into the
professions, as successful businessmen.

Yet, in America, the idea of an 'invisible hand' is widely  
known and widely accepted. This is not because more people
have read Adam Smith; it is because the intellectual
traditions of the U.S. are different.

While Nero and Caligula were proclaiming holidays,
persecuting enemies, murdering relatives and destroying the
economy...providing bread and circuses to the Roman
mobs...and otherwise acting like modern American democrats,
the Saxon tribes on the north cost of Germany were already
developing a system of evolved rules which would become
know as ""common law.""

Rather than relying upon a written legal code (such as the
Roman law...which was the basis for the Napoleonic Code),
common law was an attempt by judges and juries to find the
essential principles that allowed people to go about their
business without doing too much harm to one another. Once a
principle was discovered, subsequent judges would continue
to refine it and apply it until it was replaced by a better
one. No decrees or edicts...no centers of power...no
bureaucrats were necessary.

 This common law tradition - in which people decide for
themselves when to work and when to take a holiday, or how
much to charge for a pound of potatoes, or how high short
term interest rates should be - was exported to America, as
well as to the other Anglo-Saxon colonies.

'Tis a pity it exists in today's America more in theory
than in fact.

Your editor,

Bill Bonner

OPT-IN EMAIL SERVICE
TRADE ALERT #14
GUIDANT CORPORATION (NYSE - GDT)
June 5, 2001
11:45AMET - emailed to TFR Trade Alert Subscribers

NOTE - DELAYED DELIVERY: This information was previously distributed
to Fagan Report Trade Alert Subscribers at the above noted time and
date. Due to ever-changing market considerations - it may or may not
be applicable at this time.

TRADE ALERT #14 - Speculative Buy / Guidant Corporation (NYSE - GDT),
currently trading at $38.00 with a target above $45.00 and a stop-
loss at $34.20.

Guidant Corporation (GDT) is a global leader in the medical
technology industry providing innovative, minimally invasive, and
cost-effective products and services for the treatment of
cardiovascular and vascular disease. In short, GDT is involved with
just about everything and anything used to prevent and treat heart
attacks. With over 8,000 employees worldwide, it posted revenues in
excess of $2.5 billion for FY00. Net earnings after tax were $374.3
million. Earnings per share came in at $1.24 on a fully diluted
capitalization of 307,722,000 issued shares. Q1/01 numbers, for the
three month period ended March 31/01, are on track to produce similar
or slightly better results for FY01. Working capital at March 31/01
was $454.6 million. Total current and long term liabilities were $1.2
billion of which $350 million is expected to be paid off from cash
flow during FY01. At its current price of $38.00, it has a P/E of 32.
The only way to understand GDT is to spend an hour or two on its
website (www.guidant.com)

My thinking on this trade is that GDT will more than likely produce
better numbers this year than it did last year. Yet, at its current
price of $38.00 it is trading about 15% less than its 1999/2000 low
of $45.00. If it gets back to $45, there will be a 20% gain on the
trade. GDT's 52-week high/low stock price is $71.81/$33.00. As money
continues to rotate out of the tech sector and other economy
sensitive stocks, established medical companies like GDT should trade
higher.

Some subscribers get extra nervous trading higher priced stocks like
GDT. Remember that price is not an important consideration. The only
considerations that matter are the dollar amount of the trade and the
resulting percentage gain or loss. If you normally limit your trades
to $5,000 per transaction that's fine. Buy 130 shares of GDT. We have
a 10% stop loss limit on this trade so you are risking about $500.
The next reporting period for GDT is for the three-month period
ending June 30, 2001. If the numbers come in better than expected, we
could make 15% to 20% in 60 to 90 days. I'd be very happy with that
on this trade.

SUBSEQUENT NOTE: Wednesday morning, June 6, a day after this Trade
Alert was issued, CNBC reported that Bank of America had just
released a Buy recommendation on Johnson & Johnson. One of the
reasons given for the recommendation was that J&J has increased its
market share of the ""heart surgical stent"" market at the expense of
GDT. I think that is the reason for the weakness in today's GDT
market. The above recommendation on GDT remains unchanged, but one
should try to get the best entry price possible.

",Jeanette Doll,,
2422,"Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a 
summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA 
could purchase an ""out of the money"" call option essentially cost free, since 
its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds 
from ENA's ability to then ""move the market"" through the establishment of the 
long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested 
that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the 
marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to 
other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with 
ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for 
other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first 
pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as 
possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but 
rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier 
suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference 
between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if 
the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  

TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a 
marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable 
record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale 
of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily 
include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have 
serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing 
affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that 
applies to all interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will 
constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as 
such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's 
position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the 
transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment 
will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the 
option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso 
as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program 
would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why 
some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would 
create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps 
because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the 
underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make 
hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to 
placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for 
capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require 
TW to do so in a final order.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of 
September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC 
filing by mid-September.

In the merger, Texaco shareholders will receive 0.77 shares of Chevron
common stock for each share of Texaco common stock they own, and Chevron
shareholders will retain their existing shares.  The exchange ratio
represents approximately $64.87 per Texaco share based on Chevron's closing
stock price of $84.25 on October 13.  The exchange ratio represents an 18%
premium based upon Texaco's closing share price on October 13, and a 25%
premium based upon the two companies' average relative share prices during
the 30-day period through October 13.  As a result of the merger, Chevron
shareholders will own approximately 61% of the combined equity, and Texaco
shareholders will own about 39%.  The combined company would have an
enterprise value of more than $100 billion.

The new company will have reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent

+Calpine to Acquire SkyGen Energy

Calpine Corp. said it plans to acquire SkyGen Energy LLC (SkyGen Energy)
from Michael Polsky and from Wisvest Corp., a Wisconsin Energy Corp.
affiliate, for $450 million, plus the assumption of certain obligations of
SkyGen Energy. The SkyGen Energy acquisition -- along with other recently
announced acquisitions -- would increase Calpine's 2004 operating portfolio
to over 40,000 MW of generation.

Upon closing of the transaction, expected during the third quarter of 2000,
Calpine will increase its power portfolio by up to 13,500 MW of natural
gas-fired generation in the U.S., and will acquire 34 General Electric 7 FA
gas turbines. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will add three operating
facilities (780 MW), three projects under construction (812 MW), 13
late-stage development facilities (5,258 MW) and 16 project development
opportunities (6,615 MW).

SkyGen was founded by Michael Polsky in 1991. SkyGen will continue to
develop its portfolio of development projects as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Calpine. Michael Polsky will serve as President of SkyGen and as a member
of Calpine's Board of Directors. To fund the SkyGen Energy and other
recently announced acquisitions, Calpine has obtained a $1 billion
short-term credit facility with The Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit Suisse First
Boston and CIBC World Markets. The company expects to refinance this
facility in the capital markets.

+Panda, Calpine Form Business Alliance

Panda Energy International and Calpine Corp. formed a  business alliance
involving eight power plant projects Panda has under development,
representing nearly 10,000 MW of generating capacity. Under terms of the
agreement, Panda will provide development capabilities and carry each of the
projects to the construction phase. Calpine will have exclusive rights to
construct, own and operate the plants. Panda will participate in 50% of the
cash flow, above Calpine's priority return, in all the projects within the
alliance.

Included in the pact is the acquisition by Calpine of 24 General Electric
7FA combustion gas turbines and 12 steam turbines scheduled for delivery in
2001 to 2002. The first project to be developed under the alliance will be
the Oneta Power Partners, L.P., a 1,000 MW  natural gas-fueled power plant
now being built in Coweta, OK. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will
pay Panda approximately $126 million, which includes reimbursement of
development costs, payments for the gas and steam turbines and the Oneta
facility. The Oneta transaction is expected to close in July. It is
scheduled to go into service in 2002.",Michael Polsky Calpine,$450 million $1 billion,SkyGen Energy Calpine Corp. SkyGen Energy LLC Wisvest Corp. Wisconsin Energy Corp.

",,,
2440,"Provided below are timelines representing the time between Shipper request 
for transportation and contract tendering by Transwestern for two of the more 
recent non-standard contracts which were provided by Transwestern to 
Southwest Gas Corporation and Sempra.  The provided timelines provide an 
example of the various factors which impact the turn-around time of a 
Shipper's request for service and the actual activation of a new or amended 
transportation service.

Kevin Hyatt has received a flow chart of all the processes of acquiring an 
executed contract from the point of contract negotiation to actual executing 
by shipper - a 10 step process.  Our group can certainly discuss options to 
expedite this process. 

Sempra

6/9  Sempra negotiates right to call upon TW Permian to Needles capacity.
  Sempra understands they need to submit formal request for transportation 
  for new service.
6/12  Stephanie Katz indicates she want the remaining 1,500 Dth/d of Needles 
  capacity.  Has not yet provided TW request for the ""call"" capacity.
6/20  Stephanie and TK negotiate rate for the 1,500.  Does not provide TW
  request for Transportation.
6/21  Sempra provides request for transportation for the 23,000 Dth/d of 
  capacity, but specifically asks TW to WAIT to process untill they
  determine their supply side receipt point allocation.  CS attempts to
  relay to Sempra the ""alternate rights"" which the discount letter will 
  contain as a heads-up.  Stephanie thinks she may want other
  flexibility (California Border alternates) and tells me to WAIT untill
  she thinks about it.
6/26  CS calls Sempra to remind them time is ticking.  Sempra finally 
remembers
  to lock up supply side of deal. Promises to call me TOMORROW.
6/27  Sempra leaves a message at 4:30 P.M with receipt point allocations. 
6/28   CS asks Stephanie if she plans to negotiate with Jeff for additional
   alternates like she had considered, she says no.  Now that TW finally 
  has received a complete request for transporation Contract Admin
  generates the contract with a 2-hour period.
    CS immediately routes mutually agreed upon discount letter to officers
   for approval.
6/29  Request made as to reason for delay of contract tendering to Sempra. 



Southwest Gas Corporation

5/25  Receive SWG request for transportation service.  CS begins to draft
  discount letter with SWG, specifically confirms all provisions of contract
  with account manager.
5/31  Contract received from Contract Administration.
6/5  CS received all Officer approvals for discount letter except Bill Cordes.
6/6  CS hunts down Bill Cordes for final officer approval.  Receives Approval.

  CS faxes Larry Black on 6/6 Transwestern's OFFICER APPROVED 
  contract and discount letter .
  CS leaves Larry Black a voice-mail indicating contract is out.
  CS leaves Lorraine message indicating contract was sent.

6/9  Lorraine receives ""follow-up"" changes from May Kay to discount letter.
  Refaxes Larry Black revised letter .
6/12  CS receives another ""follow-up"" change from May Kay to discount letter.
  Refaxes Larry Black another revised letter.
6/13  Larry Black calls me indicating there are accidentally two #2 
paragraphs on the
  letter.  I renumber the paragraghs and refax letter.
6/29  Request made as to why Southwest Gas only received contract on 6/21st(?)

2443,"Transportation Notes

Projecting that linepack would slip below its minimum target level through 
Thursday, Pacific Gas & Electric issued a systemwide Stage 3 OFO, effective 
today until further notice. The order carries penalties of $5/Dth for 
negative daily imbalances exceeding a 3% tolerance. 

As a result of warmer area weather and banking on its system, Northwest said 
it is operationally feasible to loosen conditions of its entitlement for 
delivery points north of Kemmerer (WY) Station. A Declared Stage II (8% 
tolerance) Overrun Entitlement will take effect today; through Tuesday the 
pipeline was in a Stage I (3%) Entitlement. A shipper is subject to penalties 
for overtakes north of Kemmerer that exceed an amount 8% greater than its 
confirmed nominations. 

El Paso will take the B turbine at Cornudas Station in West Texas down for 
maintenance today and Thursday, reducing South Mainline capacity there by 60 
MMcf/d. However, Cornudas capacity has not been fully utilized recently, the 
pipeline said, so this reduction should not affect current markets. 

The Kinder Morgan pipeline group (NGPL, Kinder Morgan Interstate, 
Trailblazer, Canyon Creek, KN Wattenburg and TransColorado) reminded shippers 
it has a new 24-hour hotline phone number for information and questions about 
point confirmations and related issues: (713) 369-9683. The old hotline will 
stay in service through Dec. 31, but callers will hear a recording giving the 
new number. The current number for nomination-related issues, (713) 369-9670, 
is not changing, Kinder Morgan said. ",Cornudas KN Wattenburg Kinder Morgan,$5/Dth,Pacific Gas & Electric OFO Northwest Kinder Morgan NGPL Kinder Morgan Interstate Trailblazer TransColorado

El Paso Natural Gas has decided to postpone what it called ""routine"" 
maintenance projects on its system in order to maintain the flow of natural 
gas into the California market to meet the surge in demand there. The higher 
demand has been created by a shortfall in energy imports from the Northwest 
region, which has been gripped by cold weather.

2445,"Nymex Moves Gas Opening Bell Up to 9:30 a.m.

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange has amended plans 
to move 
up the start-up time for natural gas futures trading because of the overlap 
with crude oil markets, 
which share an options ring with natural gas. Daily gas futures trading now 
will commence at 
9:30 a.m. rather than 9:45. The board has scheduled expanded energy trading 
hours to begin 
with the Sept. 8 trading session. 

On July 13, the board voted to expand futures trading hours electronically 
for its light sweet crude 
oil, heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas futures and options markets. It 
also voted to have an 
earlier opening for the open outcry session for natural gas futures and 
options.

Beginning at 4 p.m. on Sept. 7 the Nymex Access electronic trading sessions 
for those commodities 
will be extended to run from 4 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays, to 9 a.m. the 
following day. On 
Sundays, the session will begin at 7 p.m. and will run until 9 a.m. on 
Monday. Currently, the sessions 
for light sweet crude oil, heating oil and gasoline begin at the same times

An old scam has surfaced recently with renewed vigor.  The Nigerian-419 fraud letter, so called because it violates section 419 of Nigerian law, is sent in many variations, by surface and airmail as well as by fax and email.  Generally the form it takes is to ask the unsuspecting victim to provide their bank account information in return for a promise to deposit a very large sum of money into that account under some pretext.

Employees should be advised that any information given will be used to further promote the scam through the emptying out of bank accounts, counterfeit and forged checks being written against the accounts, and for other illegal purposes.

While recent events have dramatically impacted Enron's travel volume,
Alliance Worldwide (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) wanted to contact
you regarding the Enron Travel Program.  Since 1984, our company has been a
strategic business partner with Enron and has provided a complete scope of
services from booking, ticketing, ticket delivery, customer service,
reporting, management of ClickTrip, to facilitating preferred vendor
arrangements with airlines to benefit Enron.    These services have been
provided on a management fee basis from Alliance to Enron.  As of December
1, 2001 the management fee has been suspended during Enron's period of
reorganization.  We are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to
Enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing
fee per ticket.  

To provide you with a brief history of our arrangement, Enron and Alliance
approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront
discounts for Enron's business travel.  These discounts are available only
through Alliance and are given at time of ticketing.  All commissions were
stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to Enron, in
exchange for Enron paying Alliance a contracted management fee.  This
management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each Enron cost center
based on the total number of transactions.  This travel program provided
Enron over $8.6 million in airline savings on $55 million spent in the year
2000 and over $5.2 million on $33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of
2001.  These savings are after the payment of the travel agency management
fee.    

The effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by
the airlines cannot yet be determined.  We have contacted the airline
companies and most of Enron's preferred carriers have agreed to extend the
contracts through April 2002.  You may utilize these discounts through
Alliance by calling 713 650-8080 or 1 800 962-0248.  In March, Enron and
Alliance will begin evaluating Enron's volume and travel patterns, and
determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure.


As mentioned earlier, Alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in
lieu of a management fee.  These fees are reimbursable to Enron employees
through normal expense report procedures.  Specifically, the new fee
structure is based on zero-commission contracts for tickets purchased from
Enron's preferred carriers.  The fee schedule for all airline tickets for
Enron travel is as follows:

$30 - Domestic tickets with or without upfront discount
$30 - International tickets without upfront discount
25% of Savings, capped at $175 - International tickets with upfront discount
$15 - Southwest Airlines and ClickTrip Reservations, Hotel/Car Only Bookings

The savings to Enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees
that are charged.  For example, Enron's average ticket prices are $589
domestic and $2207 international (after discounts). Enron's average savings
are $144 domestic and $587 international (before fees).  The savings are
more than three times the per ticket fee!

If you are accustomed to booking your own travel online, you may continue to
do so by booking through ClickTrip.  ClickTrip is the only online booking
tool that allows access to Enron's negotiated discounts.  Ticketing through
ClickTrip also bears a smaller fee of $15 if no agent assistance is
necessary.  There is no charge to look at schedules.   ClickTrip is
available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through Enron's intranet site
<http://travel.enron.com> or via the Internet site
<http://www.resassist.com/enron/>.  ClickTrip is also a useful tool for
checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status.  To check upgrade
status or to review a ticketed itinerary, simply click the Check My Trip
button on the ClickTrip home page and fill in your name and Amadeus locator
number (provided at the top of your itinerary).  A user log-in may be
obtained by contacting Alliance at 713 328-5100.

If your office location, phone number or any profile information has
changed, please notify us by return email.  A profile form is attached if
you prefer to fax the information to Alliance at 713 328-5600 or if you are
a new traveler wishing to set up a profile.

We at Alliance are proud of our 17 year association with Enron and dedicated
to ensuring you of the best possible service at the most economical price
for all of your travel needs.  We have a highly trained and experienced
staff working on Enron's account and we look forward to providing you with
continued service for years to come.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

into production and are ready for testing.  These modifications include:

Displaying the actual bids along with the evaluated bids on each of the 
detail lines.  This will allow shippers to see the actual bid rate for all 
bids greater than max rate.
Calculating the winning bids based on evaluated bid and term only (ignore 
time entered).  A "" * "" in the first column now means that the bid is a 
potential winner, not an actual winner.
Forcing shippers to bid on the full volume of the package.

The modifications do not include:

Allowing users to supersede any of their own bids greater than or equal to 
max rate.  Because this modification introduces a high risk factor, it will 
be made after Fiday's IOS.

El Paso said Thursday, 
and once that is done the test must be performed again. It estimated the 
project will extend through 
Sunday, reducing Bondad Mainline capacity by 180 MMcf/d (normal capacity is 
675 MMcf/d) and 
affecting seven receipt points. With Line 3201 out of service, the 180 MMcf/d 
loss can not be made
 up at points downstream of Bondad Mainline, El Paso said. Thus the same (not 
additional) 
180 MMcf/d reduction must be applied at Gallup (NM) Station.

Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee

Compaq Unveils 208-Key Keyboard

	Houston, TX - Compaq announced today the release of a 208 key keyboard for people who hate the ""shift"" key. In a sluggish PC market Compaq is pinning its hopes on new innovative products.  

Director of Product Development Erik Mancil said, ""We're a company that takes chances. Sure our 13 button mouse didn't go over well, but we attribute that to poor marketing not product design. The 208 position keyboard is bound to be a blockbuster product.""

Compaq plans to launch a $25 million marketing blitz using the slogan ""Frightened of a shift-y keyboard?  This keyboard has been scared shiftless.""

 According to keyboard researchers at Compaq, the standard 104 position computer keyboard layout was designed to slow down typists so the monitor can keep up.  Their research showed that the new shiftless design increased speed and accuracy in research subjects with only one finger and in a couple of monkeys.   ""Consumers of the new keyboard might have to make a little bit more room on their desktop,"" said Ted Belford, ""but most people have plenty of room.""

Belford dismissed critics of the keyboard who called it ""ridiculous"" and ""impossible to use"" by stating, ""What do they expect with our slashed R & D budget?""

""I'M GLAD THERE'S A COMPANY THAT IS ADDRESSING MY NEEDS,"" said Tyrone Dinardi of the SHIFT KEY HATERS ASSOCIATION, ""SURE 'CAPS LOCK' WILL WORK FOR THE LETTERS, BUT DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GET THE AT SIGN WITHOUT USING SHIFT?  HOW ANNOYING IS THAT?""

""That's the type of user we're targeting,"" said Mancil, ""We're also working on a 312 key version.  We really hate the 'control' key too.""

2492,"Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a 
summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA 
could purchase an ""out of the money"" call option essentially cost free, since 
its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds 
from ENA's ability to then ""move the market"" through the establishment of the 
long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested 
that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the 
marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to 
other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with 
ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for 
other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first 
pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as 
possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but 
rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier 
suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference 
between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if 
the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  

TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a 
marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable 
record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale 
of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily 
include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have 
serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing 
affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that 
applies to all interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will 
constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as 
such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's 
position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the 
transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment 
will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the 
option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso 
as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program 
would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why 
some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would 
create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps 
because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the 
underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make 
hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to 
placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for 
capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require 
TW to do so in a final order.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of 
September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC 
filing by mid-September.

Over the last couple of days, the virus pattern files that help to detect the latest viruses have been updated several times each day.   So, when you log in, the system will push the latest files and perform a scan.  This will continue as new viruses are detected and new pattern files created and distributed through our virus software providers.

Yesterday afternoon, we received the Computer Virus message regarding precautions when opening your email.  Additionally, to prevent Enron employees from accessing non-Enron mail from our network (and possibly introducing a mail-borne virus), we have blocked access to external email accounts (i.e., Hotmail, etc.).

I've incorporated my final comments into the attached draft (not red-lined).  Below are a couple of additional notes.

Footnote 4 does not appear at the bottom of the page where the actual footnote resides; it appears on the following page.  This may clear up when all the formatting is completed or it may be something that needs to be fixed.  Also, there is a line drawn above the footnote that should not be there.

I added language under #2 on page 3.  Our rationale in the second paragraph needed a lead-in, which I added to the end of the first paragraph.

For footnote 5, I deleted the text, which was from an earlier note of mine.  I changed the footnote to reference the new paragraph number instead of a page number in the NOPR.  The quote is in paragraph 7 of the NOPR.  Please revise the footnote to use the proper verbiage.

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

A draft of testimony which would be filed at the ICC with the Master Sales
Agreement Petition is attached to the accompanying memo from Jerry Fox. As
you may recall, we suggested that the draft Petition prepared by Peoples
several weeks ago be revised to better explain the transactions which would
occur under the Master Agreement and provide a basis for the ICC to
conclude that approval of the agreement is in the public interest. At the
time, Jerry said he generally agreed with the comments, but had to get more
information from his client to finalize the Petition. His intent was to
obtain the information in the form of draft testimony, which he has now
done. My preliminary review indicates that the testimony, which would
accompanying the Petition, is adequate. It explains the nature of the
expected transactions, explains how Peoples' customers benefit from the
transactions (i.e., why approval is in the public interest) and supports
the compensation mechanism. Although the testimony is somewhat sketchy, it
should be sufficient to initiate the review. The ICC Staff can ask for
whatever additional information it wishes to consider. When I speak to
Jerry, I plan to ask whether the initial draft Petition would be modified
to discuss some of the information he now has. (I believe this could be
easily done.) In any event, the basic information needed to support the
filing seems to be there. Let me know of any comments. I will wait until I
hear back before talking to Jerry Fox. (Am I correct that the new name,
Enovate (which I hadn't seen before), should be capitalized, despite the
testimony's use of small case?)

Agreements, at Kay Mann's suggestion and to expedite matters, I am
passing on changes which InterGen requires with respect to Sections
17.3(a) and 17.4.1 of both Facility Agreements:

1.  Section 17.3(a) should be revised to read as follows:

""promptly refund the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion
of the Purchase Amount) and pay Cover Damages plus Termination Costs
described in Sections 17.4.2(i) and 17.4.2(iv) described below; or""

2.  The third and fourth sentences of Section 17.4.1 should be revised
to read as follows:

""If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value, the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the ""Refund Amount"")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below.  If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is less than the Proper Scope Value, the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the ""Scope Value Due"")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below.""

It is InterGen's understanding that the Purchase Amount is currently
$1,829,000, subject to adjustment by future change orders, and that the
amounts previously paid plus the Purchase Amount are equal to the
Maximum Liability Amount of $14,352,000, subject to adjustment by future
change orders.  It is essential to InterGen that CA Development I and CA
Development II receive credit for the amounts previously paid and that
they not be required to go outside of the Facility Agreement to
determine such amounts.

Subject: Three Kick Rule 

A big city lawyer went duck hunting in South Louisiana. He shot and 
dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other 
side of a fence. 

As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on? his 
tractor and asked him what he was doing. The litigator responded, ""I shot a 
duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going in to retrieve it."" 

The old farmer replied. ""This is my property, and you are not 
coming over here."" 

The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial attorneys in the U.S. 
and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and 
take everything you own."" 

The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we do things 
in Louisiana. We settle small disagreements like this with the Louisiana 
Three Kick Rule."" 

The lawyer asked, ""What is the Louisiana Three Kick Rule?"" 

The Farmer replied. ""Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me 
three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up."" 

The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he 
could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. The 
old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and 
walked up to the city feller. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy 
work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. His second 
kick nearly ripped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on his 
belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up. 

The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get 
to his feet and said, ""Okay, you old coot now it's my turn."" 

(I love this part......) 

The old farmer smiled and said, ""Naw, I give up. You can have

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.

I look forward to your comments.

	(This article was originally published Monday) 
	WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has limited 
authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and alleged 
price gouging by power producers, but will act to overhaul the state's 
wholesale power markets if necessary, FERC Chairman James Hoecker told a 
congressional panel Monday. 
	The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff 
investigation of problems affecting power markets in the U.S. West becomes 
available, Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing 
of the House Commerce Committee's energy panel. 
	""If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction, 
we will do so,"" Hoecker told lawmakers. And if price gouging is occurring ""as 
some have alleged,"" he added, ""we will respond accordingly, by revoking 
market-based rates or otherwise."" 
	However, Hoecker stressed that the commission's authority is limited under 
the Federal Power Act. 
	""The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis. 
Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility, such as 
authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities,"" 
Hoecker testified. 
	The commission can't act to limit prices charged by power providers ""until we 
have a record supporting such action,"" he said, referring to the results of 
the pending staff investigation. 
	Further, he said, the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to San 
Diego Gas & Electric Co. for the power it purchased this summer to serve its 
retail customer base. 
	Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committee's Energy and Power 
Subcommittee, which is looking into the supply shortages in California this 
summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much 
for power as they did a year ago. 
	State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis 
	The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC, as SDG&E, a unit of Sempra 
Energy (SRE, news, msgs), sought an order setting price caps for power bid 
into the state-sponsored electricity exchange, and power producers sought an 
order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state's 
independent grid operator curtailed sales outside California, where price 
controls don't apply. 
	FERC hasn't yet responded to the producers, and deferred action on SDG&E's 
bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed. But it 
left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the 
price it pays for power, which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the 
power exchange. 
	Hoecker, while withholding judgment pending the staff probe, appeared to 
place much of the blame for this summer's crisis with the state-mandated 
market structure, which left San Diego consumers subject to spot-market 
volatility. 
	And he appeared to suggest that FERC's order directing utilities to transfer 
transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations, 
or RTOs, will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the 
power-supply problem. 
	FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in 
California because its experience with new market institutions such as power 
exchanges and ISOs was limited, Hoecker said. 
	Other states, such as Pennsylvania, were ""less prescriptive than California 
in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate,"" 
Hoecker noted. 
	Now, with FERC's Order 2000 encouraging formation of RTOs, ""the commission is 
in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale 
markets,"" he said. 
	""Large regional markets can be made to work effectively,"" Hoecker told the 
lawmakers, citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example. 
	Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the state-mandated market 
structure. 
	By requiring the state's three investor-owned utilities to purchase all their 
electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price 
risks by entering into long-term fixed-price contracts, the state left 
consumers subject to volatility in the state-mandated spot market, said 
officials with Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) and Reliant Energy (REI, news, 
msgs). 
	California's market structure ""placed no economic incentives on the default 
utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to 
their consumers,"" Reliant's John Stout testified. 
	""San Diego's experience offers the Congress an unparalleled opportunity to 
learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation,"" said Michael Shames, executive 
director of Utility Consumer's Action Network. 
	Shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that 
California's electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the 
country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow 
FERC to better police markets. 
	""California is just the latest problem area in U.S. power markets and, unless 
policymakers act quickly, it will not be the last,"" said Enron Corp. (ENE, 
news, msgs) Steven Kean executive vice president. 
	""Unless Congress and FERC are willing to address the interstate issues that 
are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators, I predict 
that our experience in San Diego is indicative of what others will encounter 
in trying to create a competitive electricity market,"" said Edwin Guiles, 
Sempra's president of regulated operations. 
	""This electricity crisis is not a California-only problem,"" said Rep. Brian 
Bilbray, R-Calif., who represents San Diego and requested Monday's hearing. 
	""We will continue to be in this mess if state and federal officials don't 
work together to find long-term solutions to the flaws in the marketplace,"" 
Bilbray said.

_______________________________________________________________

Here are my comments on the draft received earlier today: (1) Sect. 1.9.
The second to last sentence in the definition of Cumulative Net Revenues
duplicates part (but not all) of the first sentence of Section 7.2 with
regard to what is included in Cumulative Net Revenue. (I don't believe the
language of Sect. 7.2 regarding the make-up of Cumulative Net Revenue is
intended to be only ""for purposes of Section 7.1"" as the wording of 7.2
suggests, so this could be confusing.) Perhaps the make-up of Cumulative
Net Revenue should be covered in just one place or, as an alternative, the
definition 1.9 could cross-reference 7.2. Also, the last sentence of 1.9 is
confusing. I believe this means the same thing as is stated expressly in
the last sentence of Sect. 7.2, i.e., ""Cumulative Net Revenues includes
uncollectable accounts receivable for which Peoples has assumed credit risk
pursuant to Section 2.10."" As I understand it, the second part of the
sentence means: ""Cumumlative Net Revenues shall not be adjusted to reflect
revenues refunded in accordance with Section 3.3, unless the refund is
attributable to (see my comment below re use of the word ""knowing"")
application by MEH, without the knowledge or consent of Peoples, of a rate
which exceeds the maximum rate allowed under Peoples' applicable FERC
Tariffs."" Perhaps we could state this more clearly in 1.9 or
cross-reference 7.2. (2) Sect. 3.3. I would delete part (i) if the last
sentence. It would be illegal and contrary to this Agreement for MEH (or
Peoples) to charge a rate above the maximum, so it seems inappropriate to
suggest that MEH can collect a fee for doing this. Also in this Section,
Part (ii) of the third sentence was modified to add the word ""knowingly"" to
describe the situation where MEH would be responsible to pay a refund.
Because this is not something MEH can legally do, it seems inappropriate to
have a provision addressing it. The Agreement can properly address the
responsibility for refund of an inadvertent overcharge, which is how I
interpreted this provision of 3.3 in the last draft. Perhaps we should just
make Peoples responsible for all refunds. Let me know what you think. (3)
Sect. 7.2. As indicated above, I am not sure that these provisions re
Cumulative Net Revenue are only ""for purposes of Section 7.1"". I would
suggest a clarification of how this works as indictaed in point 1 above.
Also, 6 lines from the end of 7.2, I think the reference to 7.2 (ii) is a
typo. I believe it's just 7.2.(4) Sect. 18.3. Do we want to include any
work related to the Governmental Approval as ""ordinary course""? If so,
there is some suggested language in an e-mail I sent dated Aug. 28. It
suggests a revision to item (vi).",,,Sect Peoples Cumumlative Net Revenues MEH FERC the Governmental Approval

The ESA docs are being reviewed internally for financing and accounting

COA is on stand by, due to our need to focus on ESA and two new, identical 
contracts (remember, we have a lot of turbines!)

The next two up are the ones previously destined for CAL ISO - I believe 
units 17 & 18.  These units also have the dual fuel options included, so the 
base prices of each will be increased appropriately.  We will pay 75% of the 
price prior to signing the facility agreement, and the January payment will 
be increased by 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option.

The turbines will be assigned to two sister Delaware LLCS:  CA Energy 
Development I, LLC  and CA Energy Development II, LLC.  Use Ben Jacoby at 
1400 Smith, Houston, 77002 for notices and invoices for purposes of the draft.

Our counsel has provided these drafts of the project documents.  Please 
review.  We also anticipate sending out the turbine contracts later today.

Please be advised of our timeline.  Since we need to fund escrow by Wednesday 
21 March, it is imperative that we are able to sign these documents on Friday 
16 March.  It is our assumption there will be some lag between the obligation 
to fund escrow and the actual transfer of funds.  

Your comments to these documents are expected by Friday 9 March.

I also want to mention that Enron initiated the additional purchase of Power 
System Stabilizers, which cost $31,675 per turbine.  PSS are required in the 
WSCC, but you will have to  determine whether or not your particular project 
would be required to install these in New England.  If you desire this 
optional equipment, please reflect that cost in your final bid.

transaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I 
have a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.

From an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should 
proceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the 
contracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a 
revised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now 
and then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should 
proceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I'm told three other

2688,"We have several other Florida opportunities that are at about a 50% 
probability (Corbett, Deerfield, Pompano, and South Dade). We also have 
projects in Goergia (Hartwell and Athens) that are probably 70%, and 
Louisiana (Calcasieu and St Charles) that are 50%. I would put Midway at 90%. 
The non-Florida opportunities would be used to package with the turbines and 
flip a la Pastoria. We have strong interest in Georgia in particular, and 
have received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets of 
Hartwell and Athens for $4.4 million (no equip. included).

I would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q1 of '02 if 
we do not proceed with any Florida opportunities. I think the downside is 
approximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premium 
being offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we 
have a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines with 
any of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for 
7FAs, although not all permits have been received).

Assignment Language:
in (i) ""WestLB"" should be changed to ""Purchaser""
in (ii) - although this is a business point I think it is important to 
question: why should we provide credit support to the JV/partnership/llc when 
we are required to keep a min. 19.5% interest?  This is not a GE requirement 
and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture 
much more expensive to finance.

Purchase Agreement:
Def. of Business Day:  let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds 
from.
2.1(B):  It should be ""Agent's"" person to approve change orders, not 
""Purchaser's""
2.2:  ""Purchaser"" should be used rather than ""WestLB"" since it is not as 
limiting.
7.1:  Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option 
agreement execution date?
Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation:  The total amount of the three 
purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest 
Option Agreement.  I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of 
the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option 
Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of 
the transformers.

I want to make sure we don't miss any points that could affect the

major points came up as a result of this...

 ",,,A&K Stuart
2704,"Current negotiations with AALLP has provided us "" a new look "" at the current 
lease model.  It has loosened up somewhat to our benefit.  AALLP has agreed 
to a ""two bucket"" approach as indicated on the attached matrix.  Note that we 
may operate under this model until the EITF provides definitive guidance 
which is expected in December 2001.  

We should now focus on the O&M aspect of an existing or development project.  

If we pass bucket one as it relates to O&M and offtake limits of 95% or less, 
we will not be in a lease and do not proceed to bucket 2.  Bucket two is 
essentially where we have been up to now.  

In a nutshell, if Enron does not operate, does not have the ability to hire 
and fire the operator (must have less than 50% voting on this), does not set 
or approve operating policies and procedures and takes 95% or less of the 
offtake, we should not be in a lease and we stop there.  If we supply the 
fuel and take 95% or less of the offtake and pass O&M criteria, the fuel 
supply agreement must have significant LD's.  See specifics for Bucket 1 on 
the attached.

NOTE:  Please keep us in the loop on new deals as we roll out this new 
model.  We still need to scrub the deals in order to keep AALLP informed.

2750,"Notes from subject mtg.  Steve Stein - please schedule something where we can 
get together and I can hand this off to you.  Need your involvement.  

0)  Prior to the meeting - I had called Ben to let him know of my 
transitioning to EES and that I wouldn't be there - he requested that I 
come.  Keith Dodson reviewed and requested that I attend and xtion w/ Steve 
Stein.  Steve Stein was to come to meeting, but didn't show.  Steve has been 
requested to take charge by Keith Dodson.  
1) Kay Mann, Ben Jacoby, Chris Booth, Ron Tapscott, and myself were present 
at the subject meeting.  
2)  Noone from EAS came except for me.  I called and Rigby came late.  
3)  Discussed situation - Calpine evidently bought the Nov01 Westinghouse 
Machine from Westinghouse, ending Calpine's interest in our ""wet"" 501D5A.  
4)  Everyone agreed that Westinghouse wasn't ""focussed"" on resolving this.  
Kay reminded the group that prior to litigating the contract called for a 
""high level Mgmt meeting"".  Everyone seemed to agree that it was time to call 
such a meeting.  
5)  Rigby to draft a rebutal letter to the 15 Feb Westinghouse letter (where 
they again inferred that they had delivered the Generator, and if we wanted 
the new one....., we needed to provide a purchase order).  In that letter, 
Rigby will confirm that a)  we don't believe the machine was ever delivered, 
b)  we have been delayed/impeded, and c)  LD's to the tune of approx $4MM are 
due, and c)  we request the ""high level mgmt meeting"" prior to initiating 
litigation.
6)  Letter will go out with Dan Shultz's signature - need highest level just 
below Keith Dodson.  Since Dan had been involved...., the team chose him.  We 
might consider putting the letter out under Steve Stein's name.  The letter 
will also request that all future correspondance be addressed to John Rigby 
(this was Ben Jacoby's request).  
7)  Ben requested that if Dan Shultz gets any documents or calls......, that 
he refer them to John Rigby.
8)  Kay to edit letter and get out the door Fri 23 Feb.
9)  Rigby working w/ Jim Boullion to expedite insurance 
inspection/verification of coverage.  Bouillion will keep Rigby appraised.  
Inspection needed ASAP to confirm Generator is ""totalled"".  Evidently, the 
crate has now been opened, but....., our insurance inspector hasn't come 
yet.  
10)  Rigby to send email to Ben Jacoby's team every two days, detailing 
progress/req'ed action.  The entire team is disappointed in the combined lack 
of effectiviness of the ""team"" in getting this issue handled/resolved.  
11)  Ben requested that EAS have their best resouce available to inspect the 
generator with the insurance inspector - the team believes this should be Jim 
Sutherland or his designee/equivalent.  Chris Booth to acompany also.  
12)  Kay Mann confirmed that she had discussed the situation with the ENA 
origination team that was ""... on the ground..."" at VEPCO...., and they 
thought it was funny that anyone would think that the slipped Generator 
delivery date didn't ""delay or impede"" our efforts to close that deal.  Also, 
Kay reminded us that there was no tie between a specific project, and the 
""delay/impede"".  
13)  At the high level Westinghouse meeting - who will be the senior Enron 
rep?  Kevin Presto was discussed by Kay/Ben.  I discussed Steve Stein.  To be 
discussed further.  At that high level meeting....., we need to insure that 
Westinghouse sees that Enron really was ""delayed/impeded"" .  Until they 
believe our claim for LD's has merit - they probably won't attempt to 
compromise on a settlement.  Westinghouse has offered to give us our money 
back (not confirmed, but Mark has offered to run that up the flagpole).  Ben 
has requested approx $4MM more to cover IDC.  Westinghouse has said.... ""no 
way"".  So...., we have approx a $4MM dispute.  Westinghouse doesn't believe 
we have been delayed or impeded - they are not aware that we were in fact 
impeded on Electrocities, nor are they aware of the broad interpretation of 
delay/impede that would require them to pay LD's.  The team believes 
Westinghouse is acting like they ""delivered"" the generator (in June 00), so 
they can ""act"" like there should be even another reason that they don't owe 
LD's.  The team believes that Siemen's position on ""delivery"" will change 
once they debate that with a Rigby, Schwartzenburg, or a Kay Mann

ABB may be insistent upon dating this June 30, but we will try the 7th with

point to ABB.

I have not taken ABB's comment on the assignment language, but I hope they 
will accept what we've given them in this draft.

I have been advised that the price reduction is due to more definitive design 
criteria being provided by Enron.

will need WestLB's cooperation in getting the proper exemption certificate

If you don't think this will work let me know, but in that scenario I guess I would say don't count on Dave.  I guess I will have to move him into the Associate program or Logistics.  I we go down that road then I feel like I need to run this by Dave since he effectively will be cutting his ties to Risk and taking some career risk.

By 2006 the world's leading seven countries are forecast to have 148 million digital TV homes - one third of the global total!

Dear MR M MC CONNELL, 

 Front Cover <http://bookshop.informamedia.com/cod/logos/publishing/imgt0001cover.jpg>The digital TV sector is continually evolving, enabling the expansion of new revenue-generating services. Traditional broadcasting models have been superseded by new services that cross into related industries, most notably the telecoms sector. However, the proposed analogue switch-off is still in the distance - we are now entering a crucial period as other platforms vie for a niche in the digital market. 

Digital Broadcasting Revolution (4th Edition), the latest edition of the best selling report from Informa Media Group, addresses the key issues in the developing digital broadcasting sector. Providing you with the necessary intelligence to make informed decisions, the report: 

* investigates the future direction of digital broadcasting 
* focuses on new and emerging digital technologies and the provision of new revenue streams
* evaluates which of the emerging digital platforms will be successful
* contains extensive digital settop box forecasts up to 2006
* provides in-depth profiles of the world's leading seven countries in the sector. 

New to this edition: 

Substantially expanded and fully updated, the latest edition also contains entirely new chapters on: 

* Content and rights focusing on business strategies to exploit multiple digital platforms
* Regulation and piracy as broadband Internet makes audiovisual piracy relatively easy. 

Digital broadcasting content is increasing in sophistication and broadband Internet offers an important new market in which rights owners can fully exploit their content. Digital Broadcasting Revolution (4th Edition) contains case studies on leading companies, such as Canal+ and Microsoft, allowing you to assess your market position and learn from the experience of market leaders. 

Supported by a wealth of tables, statistics and forecasts, Digital Broadcasting Revolution (4th Edition) is essential reading for anyone requiring topical, up-to-date information on the global digital broadcasting sector.

According to Scott Mills, the back office administration for Brazilian trade

the operation so far lacks scale to justify the implementation of more 
sophisticated tools, such as Enpower and Sitara It is also unclear whether 
these applications will support the types of trade identified. The idea is to 
convert to more professional tools after an initial period of evaluation and

2802,"I've pulled together some general ideas on marketing within ENE and how it 
would ideally be structured for GRM.

Marketing & Origination Model

For GRM, our success is entirely dependent on a developing a team of 
dedicated marketers who specialize in delivering insurance risk management 
solutions to clients. The business model is a risk aggregation play 
(gathering first loss and co-share pieces of insurable risks we understand). 
We risk impairing our ability to create a portfolio of risks that can be 
managed, repackaged and placed in the capital or insurance markets at large 
if we don't have direct influence over the deal flow being generated. To 
accomplish this my ideal marketing/origination model working with other Enron 
business units would be:

Client Originator: Centralized in a long term origination team in ENA, EGM, 
EIM (as opposed to midmarket function) with industry specific expertise, e.g. 
oil    & gas, power, coal, forest products, etc. The CO would be responsible 
for maximizing client profitability for Enron in an investment banking 
capacity, making sure we have an inside track to the client's strategic 
initiatives/business opportunities and making sure we package complete 
solutions using  all ENE product areas. The CO also needs a financial 
incentive (see below) to take responsibility for making sure each individual 
product area is servicing the client where possible, particularly when a 
package solution is not viable, e.g like outsourcing. The CO should be 
involved with all product marketing calls if possible, but would not act as 
gate keeper, rather act more as a control valve creating a steady flow of 
ideas, products and services to the client.

Product Marketer: Centralized in a product marketing team, with industry 
knowledge and product specific expertise. While the PM will call on clients 
for      independent origination of new business opportunities, ideally the 
bulk of the opportunities should be marketing to clients identified by the CM 
to have a need for GRM's products or services. The marketing is done in 
partnership with the CO, but the driver of the transaction would be the PM. 
Execution would be handle by the PM's business unit with a portion of 
revenues devoted to the CO for their origination of the opportunity. However, 
if a particular group or CO  does not play ball or does not generate any 
business leads, the PM would still be free to originate business 
independently.

Shared Resources Centralized in a group like Fundamentals, Research, Weather 
Desk, etc. Especially useful in upstream where the deals require extensive    
engineering work and technical support. We currently use Walt Hamilton, 
Senior Reserve Engineer who works for Craig Fox in Enron Capital Resources, 
not full-time but nearly full time. Once we have a few deals booked, an 
engineer will also need to maintain the position by reviewing the reserves on 
a regular basis. I would envision having Walt on our payroll, working for us 
but remaining part of a resource pool that could be shared depending on deal 
flow and priorities set by Craig. 

Shared P&L  Tough to implement, but unless there is a real financial 
incentive, CO's will naturally focus on deals they originate and the earnings 
stay in their group.  I've worked with splits ranging from 80/20 if we do all 
the work and it is a simple referral, to 50/50 if the transaction opportunity 
is further developed by the time we get involved, typically as part of a 
structured package solution.

This is best case, but in case you're wondering, I haven't lost my senses. 
Enron is not currently the ideal company to take this approach and I don't 
believe GRM is the ideal guinea pig to make the change. Some hybrid solution 
is probably better for us, tailoring the effort based on the particular group 
we work with. In the case of EGM business units, I think this is the way to 
go since we can influence our own people. In the case of ENA or other Enron 
companies, we need to be more selective, with the worst case being we go it 
alone and duplicate efforts. This is the path we're on today with ECR's 
upstream business, however it is not how we are proceeding with EIM where we 
are trying to build bridges with forest products and steel, or ENA's power 
desk, where we have the double trigger product for them to market.

Soap Box

A little background and my general view of marketing at Enron after nearly 3 
years here. In my banking career I've worked both as a relationship manager, 
marketing all the bank's product areas to a targeted client base, as well as 
a product specialist working with a relationship manager to service that 
client base and execute product specific business. Our competitors, whether 
investment banks or commercial banks, seemed to have a similar setup, 
although they varied in design from broad geographical marketing assignments 
to industry specific assignments.  For me, this type of marketing and 
origination setup was easy to leverage, meaning my product specialist teams 
could hire the best and remain small and efficient.

Enron is the first company I've worked for that doesn't have a coordinated 
origination and  marketing approach to clients. Instead, the culture here is 
clearly based on free access to all clients, i.e. no gate keepers, no 
ownership of the client and hence no one individual accountable for 
maximizing the profitability of business closed with a client. Several 
different product/trading areas can all call on the same client with little 
or no coordination and have no game plan to maximize profitability. A clear 
benefit of not having relationship managers is speed to market with new 
products and new ideas combined with specialist knowledge about the product 
or service being sold. (In fact, I believe this has been a direct contributor 
to our ranking as the most innovative company in America.) A clear drawback 
is duplication of effort and weak implementation of cross-selling.....given 
lip-service by most marketing and origination teams I have worked with. 
Nevertheless, given Enron's successful track record, it appears the benefits 
outweigh the drawbacks and it is a system I've comfortably adjusted to.

Enough of the soap box. Just wanted to share my general Enron marketing 
thoughts and a little of my bias.

I don't know if this was specific enough for you so let me know if you need 
more detail. Consider this part of a dialogue.

New Name?

I'm also exploring alternative names for the group that identify our role 
more readily.  What do you think of the name Insurance Risk Management Group 
or Insurance Risk Management Solutions?   The latter ties into Enron's new 
way of describing its business activities...Logistical Solutions. I met with 
Dennis Vegas to discuss branding and general marketing of our activities and 
he said Logistical Solutions will be in our annual report and a major theme 
going forward. 

Hope you had a nice holiday. Speak to you next week.

2814,"Gary,

Thanks for the email.  Here is my attempt to type out a response.  I hope it 
helps.

1.  It was a matrix organization.  The IT personnel reported into the Global 
Tech. group but we did that for communication and consistency  purposes 
rather than simply control.  They attended business unit staff meetings and 
the BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant 
feedback.  It was vitally important for the ""customer"" to be happy and that 
the IT person completed the projects from the BU.  When it came to the review 
process itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit 
had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.

2.  When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day 
working of the IT world.  IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly 
created 5th business unit at Enron.  Remember Global Technology had more that 
IT alone.  We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments 
group and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing 
around the world.

Philippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.  He is in the office 
of the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly 
appointed COO.  Both LK and GW are non IT people.  There are many VPs on the 
next level that are IT executives.

3.  In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience 
and title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the 
world.  He chuckled and said something like, ""That sounds like Enron, it 
always looks at things differently.  He then stated that my CEO title and 
Enron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place 
soon,  as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize 
it and change its culture"".

4.  When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the 
business ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.  For example, 
we were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated 
EnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it 
for free.  Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was 
going great.  We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that.

Gary, I hoped that helped.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have 
any other questions.

I'll follow-up on Treasury Connect, thanks for the heads up.

By the way, science is Gary's passion and he has an undergraduate and MS in

Attached are the minutes from the August and September meetings of the
POCCC Condo Association.  I'll try to get these out to everyone on a
more timely basis in the future (or get Becky to do them!).  Almost
everything discussed  in the minutes has moved forward substantially
since the meetings, so if you have any specific concerns or questions,
you had better call somebody.  There is no set schedule for Association
meetings, but we'll have agendas sent out by e-mail at least a couple of
days before the meeting date.  We will very likely have a meeting in
October.

Several people have been asked by their insurance companies to provide
the compliance certificate to get windstorm coverage (Form WPI - 8).  I
have it and can fax it to you if you need it.  Let me know.

This last weekend was great.  Main Lodge is nearly done.  Great
countertops!  Big screen football on Saturday with Franklin and Aplin
and everyone they ever met.  Mass barbeque Saturday night.  Kim and Glen
Wind (with a handfull of volunteers) assembled the Kid's Lodge furniture
and painted the walls.  The room looks great and is ready for action.

We're working on the pool fence.  Original proposal for blinds is
apparently coming to fruition, in about 2 weeks.  Closing packages are
out.  Final cash calls are also out and need to be paid.  Working on
final punchlist for entire project (not inside your unit).  Working on
interviewing caretakers and preparing job description.  Trash is getting
picked up and grass is being mowed.

If you or your administrative assistant need to be trained on XMS, there are 
several options available:

These demonstrations will give an overview of XMS functionality but will not 
offer hands-on training.

the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

""Congratulations""; it could not have happened to a better person !

Jean",Jean,,Senior Specialist
2863,"Errol,   This is what I spoke to you about on the phone...

In order to prepare for the new Broker-Client application that EOL will be 
supporting, we need to clean up the EOL deals in tagg.  We have found alot of 
deals in tagg that have EOL in the broker field, but no EOL deal number.  
Most of these are due to second legs being added manually after the EOL 
transaction, or the EOL deal number being deleted from the tagg leg.  We are 
asking risk to go thru these deals and add the EOL deal number to the legs 
that do not have the deal number listed.  

For example, if the deal is two (+) legs and only one leg has the EOL number 
on it and clearly the other legs are associated with the one EOL transaction, 
manually enter the EOL deal number into the remaining legs.  

Attached is the list of deals.  I spot checked several of these and pretty 
much found the common trend of one leg has just EOL in the broker field and 
the second leg has EOL in the broker field and an EOL deal number.  I have 
seperated the list into different tabs by counterparty name.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Dawn

2864,"Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

2868,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

2878,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

fall.  If I'm not mistaken, the ""O"" magazine, the one that Oprah Winfrey 
publlishes had a coupon for August Max stores.  I'm not sure iif it was this

EA Estate Group:

Please see the below reference of Enron's vacation eligibility, allowance, and scheduling policy:

Vacation Eligibility:
All regular full-time employees are eligible for vacation based on continuous service.  Regular part-time employees receive 40 hours per year of paid vacation per year.  Temporary employees are not eligible for vacation.

Vacation Allowance:
Vacation allowance is based on an employee's continuous service according to the following schedule.  Employees must be on the payroll and actively at work as of the first business day of the calendar month to accrue vacation for that month.  If the first day of the month falls on a holiday or weekend, causing the employee to have a hire date other than the first, the vacation accrual date will be dated the first of the month so that the employee will accrue vacation for the month.  (For example, an employee with a hire date of January 5, 1998 will have a vacation accrual date of January 1, 1998.  The intent of this change is only to affect the vacation accrual date as explained; it is not to affect any other term, condition, privilege, or benefit of employment.)

Length of Continuous Service--Vacation Allowed
From hire date to the end of the calendar year in which the employee was hired -- Prorated accrual of 10 hours per month for each full calendar month completed.
For an employee hired in a prior calendar year who has less than 10 years of service -- 3 weeks (120 hours) per year
For an employee with at least 10 but less than 20 years of service -- 4 weeks (160 hours) per year
For an employee with at least 20 years of service -- 5 weeks (200 hours) per year
Vacation may be taken any time in the calendar year in which the employee will complete required service for 3 weeks, 4 weeks, or 5 weeks of vacation, per the schedule above, except for the hire year.

Vacation Scheduling and Approval:
Supervisors- The supervisor will develop a vacation schedule that ensures all essential operations are maintained effectively.  All vacation requests are subject to Supervisor approval.

2918,"Kam, last year when this deal was set up, I set up deal tickets extending 
into the future for 5 years (I would have extended it all the way to 2010 but 
the Risk people back then asked me not to).  I have a new ticket for each 
season since the volumes at each primary point and fuel change over the years 
and by season.  Extending Sitara 217969 through is going to be doubling 
volumes for one and secondly, it won't reflect the correct primary points for 
each season.  I would really like to be consulted about these kind of changes 
before they are made and maybe we and Scott Neal could sit down and figure 
out a better way to keep up with the value.  I'll run some facilitation 
reports and see if this has caused us any trouble that we may need to fix.

Thanks, Sabra

ated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven=

 on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured=
 his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy =
Carter  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his h=
amstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, th=
e Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his =
starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this seas=
on to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jac=
kson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-De=
aler it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson h=
ad been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had i=
ndicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benj=
amin Gay, Jackson's Fanta! sy! value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB DA=
L - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weeke=
nd, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's s=
tarting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver=
 wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Upd=
ated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarte=
r due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia=
 is uncertain at this time. !  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/=
19/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver,=
 told the Washington Post that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would be=
 ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham wo=
uld start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fanta=
sy option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 1=
1/19/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee.=
 However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dalla! s ! faces=
 Denver on Thanksgiving Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 1=

 Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent=

njury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Mu=
hsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left=
 shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 ga=
me against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated=
 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redsk=
ins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10! t! imes for 28 yards. It is apparent=
 Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary=
 will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards a=
nd a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, an=
d Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plu=
mmer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TD=
s and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare f=
or Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , =
RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman t=
o 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks=
 unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Ar=
izona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan! , ! who always =
gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught=
 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature War=
ren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good =
Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Upd=
ated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he=
 rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consis=
tently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive,=
 but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/18/=

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). ","David Oxley

2960,"Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=

(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20

c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;

f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=

to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=

and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=

goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=

b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=

with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=

our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=

If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.",,,Enron Corp. Savings Plan Savings Plan Hewitt and Northern Trust Enron

3005,"Unless there have been recent changes of which I am unaware, a ""gas day"" runs 
from 8:00 a.m. on one day until 8:00 a.m. on the next day.  Based on this 
premise, I need to get a clarification of what you actually mean when you do 
a termination letter stating that a contract will be terminated on the first 
of a particular month.

As the systems currently work, if a termination date is entered as the first 
of any month, the deal is rolled over in Sitara for the ENTIRE month.

If Sitara was changed to better read the dates from Global Contracts, it 
would still roll the deal over & allow gas to flow through the 1st (which 
would actually be until 8:00 a.m. on the 2nd).

When you terminate a contract on the first of any month:

Do you mean that gas should only flow through the end of the previous month 
(which would end at 8:00 a.m. on the 1st of the next month)?

or

Do you mean that gas should flow through the end of the 1st day of the month 
(which would end at 8:00 a.m. on the 2nd of the month)?

or

Can it be either, based on the individual situation?  (If so, please explain.)

Please let me know your views on this issue.  I have requested the IT group 
to change all of the ""1st of a month"" termination dates in Global Contracts 
to the last day of the previous month in order to prevent Sitara from 
assuming that the deal is good for the entire next month.  But, before they 
act on this request, we want to make sure that we are interpreting the 
meaning correctly.

I talked further with Transwestern Counsel today concerning the issues and 
have the following points;

 1.  FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS (at 
that time via Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) in the filings for the 
certification of the Kachina units.  FERC simply didn't ask any further 
questions in that proceeding.  The Operation & Maintenance Agreements in 
place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same things as the 
Operational Control Agreement in Gallup.  TW feels the O&M agreements would 
be adequate to answer any questions that possibly FERC might ask regarding 
this subject matter.  The Operational Control agreement was put into place in 
Gallup because it was thought to be easier to give FERC exactly what is was 
looking for rather than show them the Gallup O&M Agreement which might slow 
down the process at that time.

 2.  There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of 
penalty or discontinue the Compression Service's due to TW's operation of 
Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.  No regs or law address 
this situation.  Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware 
of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in 
place to accomplish control for TW.

 3.  I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that 
the petition for rehearing does effect the status of the certificate.  
Construction is moving ahead and the anticipated start date is May 1.  

I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as 
soon as I recieve it.  Let me know if you have any further questions (713)

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Got your message today, thanks.  I spent my gift certificate at Urban Retreat and now I am exhausted.  Too much beauty in one day!!  Tomorrow I have to go to MDA to my onocologist.  I am doing well except for the food issues.  I have lost 17 pounds because I still have alot of nausea.  I am sure it will pass soon and all the weight will come pouring back on!!!  Hope you are doing OK and not working yourself to death.  Take care and talk to you soon.

America's surefire plan to defeat the terrorists. 

Take all American women who are within five years of menopause - train 
us 
for a few weeks, outfit us with automatic weapons, grenades, gas masks, 
moisturizer with SPF15, Prozac, hormones, chocolate, and canned tuna - 
drop 
us (parachuted, preferably) across the landscape of Afghanistan, and let 
us 
do what comes naturally. 

Think about it.  Our anger quotient alone, even when doing standard 
stuff 
like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable enough to make 
even 
armed men in turbans tremble. 

We've had our children, we would gladly suffer or die to protect them 
and 
their future.  We'd like to get away from our husbands, if they haven't 
left already.  And for those of us who are single, the prospect of 
finding 
a good man with whom to share life is about as likely as being struck by 

lightning.  We have nothing to lose. 

We've survived the water diet, the protein diet, the carbohydrate diet, 
and 
the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across America and never lost a 
pound.  We can easily survive months in the hostile terrain of 
Afghanistan 
with no food at all! 

We've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware 

stores, or sporting events...finding bin Laden in some cave will be no 
problem. 

Uniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government?  Oh, 
please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and 
extended 
families at Thanksgiving dinners for years ... we understand tribal 
warfare. 

Between us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick there is 
for 
how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money sources.  We 

know how to find that money and we know how to seize it ... with or 
without 
the government's help! 

Let us go and fight.  The Taliban hates women.  Imagine their terror as 
we 
crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain. 

I'm going to write my Congresswoman.  You should, too! ",bin Laden,,Urban Retreat MDA Prozac Taliban

3131,"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Dow Jones Newswires
Calif Attorney Genl Says Likely To File More Energy Suits
Dow Jones Newswires

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday
he is likely to file more unfair business practice lawsuits against energy
suppliers he thinks overcharged for electricity.

But Lockyer, in a telephone interview, said after a yearlong investigation
he has found no criminal wrongdoing by any energy suppliers. He said he has
discovered possible civil violations of California consumer laws prohibiting
overcharging - violations that carry no jail or prison time.

Lockyer's disclosure came a week after the state's top law enforcement
official sued Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent to Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., for allegedly siphoning billions from its underling and
forcing it to seek federal bankruptcy protection.

The PG&E suit is ""the first of many I would expect in the energy area to
overcome overcharges,"" Lockyer told The Associated Press.

""We've devoted a huge amount of investigative and lawyering time to get back
the money...generators extracted from Californians,"" he added.

Lockyer declined to name other companies that he would sue, but his office
has subpoenaed records from Dynegy, Enron Corp., Mirant Corp. and Reliant
Energy - all of which have denied wrongdoing. In the interview, the attorney
general did mention Enron by name, saying ""we're still looking at the energy
overcharges,"" and he accused Enron of withholding documents.

Enron, a major energy trading concern, has filed for bankruptcy protection
following the disclosure that it misstated its earnings by hundreds of
millions of dollars.

PG&E, the only supplier Lockyer has sued, blamed its woes on a 1996
California law that left it unable to collect the full price of electricity
from its customers.

Lockyer's disclosure that he hasn't discovered criminal conduct, including
no evidence of a conspiracy to fix prices, comes nearly a year after he said
he wanted to jail Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman. Lockyer told the Wall
Street Journal in May that, ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8
by 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is
Spike, honey.""'

On Wednesday, Lockyer declared the statement ""rhetorical excess,"" adding,
""So far...we haven't found criminal behavior associated with pricing
policies.""

Still, the city of San Francisco has accused 13 energy suppliers of
manipulating prices in a suit that is pending in San Diego County Superior
Court.

That suit alleges the suppliers manipulated supplies to keep prices high.
San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Mark Slavin said the city doesn't have
proof of those allegations, but would uncover them as the lawsuit proceeds
in a process known as discovery.

""We think that the discovery process will uncover anticompetitive behavior,""
Slavin said.

The energy suppliers have denied the allegations.

A California legislative committee also investigating a spike in wholesale
energy costs has served additional subpoenas on Enron officials.

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the
Wholesale Energy Market summoned Enron officials to appear for depositions
regarding destruction of documents. Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, and the
committee's chairman, said he's concerned that documents destroyed by
Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, were covered by a legislative subpoena
issued in June.

Dunn's committee on Wednesday also agreed to subpoena Andersen regarding the
Enron records.

3148,"The European model, one of the ""major four"" models the market analyzes is in
and it shows generally mild conditions for much of the eastern interconnect
through the end of next week.
In fact, through at least 10 days, and probably beyond, this particular
model shows no sign of any major intrusions of cold air into the eastern
interconnect.

For the tropical feature in the Carribean, it brings the storm up along the
West Coast of Florida, just east of all the production areas this weekend
and stalls it out over the Southeast early next week meaning some rain
there.

We'll need to re-evaluate all of the models in the morning for the long

Enron's Wind Unit Reported in Talks Energy: Turbine division may fetch $723 million. More bidders could come forward.

Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company 
HOUSTON -- Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, is in talks to sell its wind turbine unit for more than $723 million, the Sunday Business newspaper in London reported, without citing sources. 
The negotiations may falter, inviting other bids, the newspaper said. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer wouldn't comment on the report. 
Enron has said manufacturing might not be part of its future strategy, Palmer said. Enron Wind makes and operates wind-power turbines. Houston-based Enron bought the business, based in Tehachapi, Calif., in January 1997. 
""There is a tremendous potential for a wind or renewable energy market to develop,"" Palmer said. ""We don't know that we need to be in the manufacturing business to participate in that."" 
Credit Suisse First Boston is handling the sale, Sunday Business said. Private equity firms that may bid include Doughty Hanson & Co. and Candover Investments, both of Britain; Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Germany; and Nomura Securities Co. of Japan, the paper said. 
Possible industry buyers include Vestas Wind Systems and NEG Micon, both of Denmark; Gamesa of Spain; and Nordex and Enercon, both of Germany, the paper said. 
Last week, Enron Chief Executive and President Jeffrey K. Skilling abruptly resigned. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay has taken over his duties.

So far my day's much quieter than yesterday...THANK GOODNESS.  Everyone and 
their brother harrassed me yesterday.  Here was the best one though.  A 
manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the 
analyst's) password to the VAR system so I could print some reports for 
him(the manager).  He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his 
desk when he gets here at 7:30.  Here's the best part though it takes about 
30 minutes to print all these reports.  So essentially he was asking me to 
come in at 5:00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 
7:30.  I told the analyst to tell him, ""Not just no, but HELL NO!!  I don't 
work for him, and  I have more important things to do.  If he had any 
questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further.""  Funny, I 
didn't hear from him yesterday.  I was actually hoping he'd call because I

I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the 
Canadian origination variance.  You may already be aware, but on the Orig 
Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day.  
However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate 
applied is the average rate for the month.  Therefore these values will never 
be the same.  Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada 
on Monday.  Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so 
that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't 
recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward 
the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris.

3206,"Hello Again,

Most of may have thought that I jumped ship in Malaysia to become a beach
bum but unfortunately I didn't.  We just spent a long 4 weeks at sea that
was not easy.  It is more the boredom of routine that slows the time down.
The team was getting a bit touchy with each other and everyone needed a
break.  We pulled into Bahrain in the Persian Gulf and it was a good time to
recharge.  We all survived the break and are now back out in the Persian
Gulf.  We will in the Persian Gulf until the end of May.  The ship's
aircraft fly everyday over Southern Iraq enforcing Operation Southern Watch,
the No-Fly zone.  The aircraft have been engaged by surface-to-air missiles
and anti-aircraft artillery.  The aircraft then bomb them into oblivion with
laser guided bombs.  I have seen the footage and it is pretty devastating.
Still the Iraq's light up their gun radars, though.  The Cruiser and
Destroyers of the Battle Group are on a different mission which is the
Maritime Intercept Operation of the UN.  This is the enforcement of oil
embargoes on Iran and Iraq for UN sanctions.  The ships stop the freighters
or tankers and then send in Navy Seals or Marines to search the ship.  I
have seen the footage of this and it is unbelievable the instant
coordination that goes on.

Below is my adventure in Bahrain and some pictures to go with them.  See you
all in the summer!

After 4 long weeks out to sea the Stennis finally weighed anchor at the port
of Bahrain.  The whole team was very relieved to have a day off after 29
days straight of working 10-14 hour days.

Day 1
They called the liberty call at 10 AM, which is earlier then they have ever
called it. I was caught in the shower so I had to rush to finish up.  My
bags had been packed for days so I was able to catch up with the rest of the
team in the Hanger Bay.  They have a new system called a Smart Card system
that logs everyone in and out of the ship. This always causes a 10-15 minute
delay.  After this though there are always plenty of boats to take us pier
side.  We hopped on one and rode the 4 miles into the dock area.  It was a
heavily industrious harbor and the water, though warm, looked a bit
polluted.  Tons of jellyfish were also seen throughout the water.  We then
walked about a half-mile down the pier and into the American Naval Base that
was there.  The gates and barricades to this place were heavier then the
White House and more heavily defended.  For most of the ship, they were not
granted overnight liberty and so the base would the focus of there
relaxation. There were bars setup and all sorts of activities planned.  We
caught a cab to our hotel, the Le Meridien that was the nicest in Bahrain
and had its own private beach.  The hotel was like an oasis in the desert
because it was outside the main city of Manama and surrounded by scrub
desert.  At the gate of the hotel an armed guard with a machine gun searched
the trunk of the cab.  Inside the hotel there were all Saudi's. It was the
end of the Hajj, their most religious time of the year, and they all come to
Bahrain to drink, smoke, and do other sins against Allah.  The whole ship
was told explicitly to stay out of their way by the XO of the ship.  Our
rooms weren't ready so we dumped our bags and went out to the pool caf, for
some lunch.  Lunch was a huge buffet spread that had shwarma's, Persian
rice, and all sorts of good Mid East food. We ate and drank for a couple of
hours.  I then got my room and changed to go to the beach.  The beach was
man-made and enclosed by a lagoon where I sat in the sun the rest of the
afternoon.  At 7PM some of us met to go get some drinks before dinner.  We
walked to the Trader Vic's next to the hotel and found it open but empty.
They apparently don't believe in happy hour.  We had some drinks and ate
there.  At 11 PM we left there to go meet up with some people from the ship
at an Irish Pub. They had Guinness on tap so I was happy.  We followed most
of the pilots from the Stennis to the Warbler that had a band that rocked
until 2 AM.  We then returned exhausted to the hotel and after making some
embarrassing late night calls (which of course is daytime in the States) to
friends, I went to sleep.
Day 2
The second day started much later as I was sleeping spread eagle on my king
sized bed and didn't want to leave it-ever.  I stumbled to the beach with a
headache and sat on the beach for the entire afternoon.  The 4weeks at sea
had apparently wiped out my tolerance.  I walked around the lagoon and took
it easy.  Since I realized that most restaurant did not start the food
service until 9 PM I decided to eat a late lunch at 4 PM which consisted of
the same incredible buffet as the day before.  We all met up in the club
level of the hotel around 8 PM for drinks before we decided to eat.  I was
not feeling to great but decided to join some of the people who were going
to the Italian restaurant that was located inside the hotel.  This was an
exceptional place where the food was very good.  The Veal Milanese rivaled
the best I have had in the States.  I felt much better after that and was
willing to join the rest of the group going out to a nightclub.  The
nightclub turned out to be pretty dead and at 2AM we called it a night.
Day 3
I woke up around 12PM and again had to fight to get out of bed.  I had set
my A/C to very cold and was buried under many soft blankets.  I met up with
a few people and ate lunch at the caf, on the beach. We then walked over to
the lagoon and sat on the beach over there for the rest of the afternoon.
The best thing about it was that there was a golfcart that drove around with
drinks and snacks for everyone.  I read my book and dozed most of the
afternoon.   The sun was never particular strong the whole time we were
there which I think was do to the amount of dust from the Saudi desert 30
miles across the Persian Gulf.  It reduces visibility across the entire Gulf
and into Iran.  3 of us decided to do the tourist thing in Bahrain later in
the afternoon.  The only thing we were told to go see was this new mall that
was built.  To me it was just like seeing any other mall except it was a
little smaller then US malls.  I didn't buy anything but it was interesting
to look at prices that were about double US standards.  You can haggle for
any price including a pair of socks but you couldn't get them to US prices.
Everything on Bahrain is imported because it is an island.  Upon returning
to the hotel around 8PM we met up with a group that was going to the
Lebanese restaurant inside the hotel.  This was also rated the best in
Bahrain.  It was quite a feast with 5 main courses spread from 10 PM until 2
AM with bellydancers and singers entertaining everyone.  It was in a huge
tent with beautiful Persian carpets everywhere.  I never ate so much and had
a great time. I literally rolled into bed.
Day 4
Our last day since we had to get back on the ship tonight.  Liberty expired
at 6 AM in the morning and it too much of a hassle to try and go in the AM.
I woke up and spent most of the day doing PwC paperwork by dialing in.
There were hundreds of junk emails to toss out and maybe 5 real messages
over 4 weeks of no connection.  I had the usual time and expense Nazis
screaming at me to sign timesheets.  After 3 months and multiple
explanations they still don't get that I have no connectivity.  I can't wait
to see that appear on my GCF.  I got most of what I needed done.  I then
needed to get my watch fixed and set out to find an Omega dealer in Bahrain.
After following at least 6 peoples directions to places they swore were
there, I gave up and would wait until Dubai.  Dubai is a larger city and has
multiple Omega dealers.  For our final meal we decided to again stay at the
hotel.  There was an excellent Indian restaurant in the hotel.  I couldn't
tell you the Indian name for the food I ordered but it was curry chicken and
a basmati rice/lamb combination.  Again I ate way too much and had to roll
out of there.  We packed up and headed to ship around 10 PM.

All in all it was great to get away from the ship for a couple of days after
the 4-week binge.  Bahrain doesn't have much to it and is basically
supported by all the Saudi's who drive across every weekend to party.  The
American base is tiny there.  I am glad the next 3 stops in the Persian Gulf
will be Dubai.  I was also told that Dubai has better values on gold and
rugs.  From now on all of our at-sea-periods will be around two weeks, Thank
God!

Thanks for your time today.  Attached are some materials I've written on my 
structure and an enhanced schematic.  When combined with what I gave you and 
this note you should have a pretty good idea of what I'm trying to accomplish.

First step is for Enron to come up with a prospective valuation for this 
plant each year for the next twenty years.  That valuation will set the 
maximum amount of debt we will allow the plant to carry in any given year up 
to a twenty year final maturity.  At some point,  the plant valuation going 
forward will exceed the outstanding debt because the debt amortises to zero 
whereas the plant will always have residual value to the end of its remaining 
useful life and at a minimum scrap value. 

Enron will then enter into two parallel and offsetting price risk management 
contracts which will pay a demand charge equal to debt service in exchange 
for formula floating payments.  The formula floating payments will be 
calculated as the positive difference, if any, between the generator strike 
price and a market index price for energy.  The two contracts will contribute 
to the credit of the project by their respective positions in the project 
flow of funds.  The top contract, (i.e. financial buy), will pay a demand 
charge to the project and will be on a parity in the flow of funds with debt 
service.  The lower contract (i.e. financial sell) will receive a demand 
charge and will be subordinate in the flow of funds to debt service and O&M 
costs.   The two contracts are engineered so that project revenue 
deficiencies will show up in the projects ability or inability to make the 
demand charge to Enron under the financial sell contract.  Therefore, the two 
contracts are opposite and identical except for their credit exposure to the 
project.  Flow of funds is as follows:

Revenues:
Merchant marketing activities to third parties
Demand payments from Enron under financial-buy
Energy payments from Enron under financial-sell
Other

Flow of funds:
Variable O&M
Debt service and financial-buy energy payments to Enron
Fixed O&M
Demand payment to Enron under financial-sell contract
Repayment of moneys owed Enron
Reserve replenishment
Equity

Payments owed Enron under both contracts will be secured by a subordinate 
lien on the same security package as the senior debt.

The two contracts should not create any MTM earnings effects or commodity 
desk VAR effects until one of them disappears.  At that point we hopefully 
have commodity hedge values that will offset the MTM valuation and VAR effect 
of the remaining exposed contract.

The contracts will be written directly to the trustee to avoid bankruptcy 
issues involving treatment of executory contracts.  The contracts will also 
be written through our Bermuda insurance subsidiary with offsets back to EPMI 
in order  to avoid potential insurance issues.

My plan is to charge a fee for entering into these two contracts which will 
be paid up-front.  Other features of the two contracts include:

No cross default,
The financial buy contract cannot be terminated for bankruptcy filing or any 
other such credit signal trigger,
Either contract can be terminated for non-performance (since financial this 
means payment default),
Either contract can be terminated at any time by either party by making a MTM 
payment except the financial-buy contract can only be terminated by Enron for 
non-performance.

Any questions, please feel free to call me at 3-4750.

Another issue I have in my mind is how we handle revenue after 3 and 5 years. 
Since Calpine will have only 3 or 5 year tolling agreement, it is appropriate 
to assume Calpine's revenue will come purely from market. Therefore, we may 
just need one line of revenue, rather than breaking into capacity payment and 
energy payment. Let's talk to Scott when he gets back to Houston.

3226,"I was informed today by Rochester that they will not be working with Enron 
(or General Electric) on the LM-6000 Project.  The following are key points:


1.  Based on a GE evaluation of the site, the total net output of a new 
LM-6000 with Sprint Package is 42.2 Mw at average site conditions (79 degrees 
@ 1,006').

2.  Rochester had initially thought they would need 25 Mw and Enron could 
re-market the balance until Rochester's load growth utilized the balance.  
Rochester had initially considered an LM-2500 (25 Mw) and was not in favor of 
a larger machine becasue they thought the incremental 20-25 megawatts would 
cost in the $6MM to $8MM range.  Enron's proposal absorbed Rochester's risk 
of the incremental megawatts and Rochester was very interested in our 
concept.   Subsequent to our discussions with Rochester and providing a 
couple of proposals, the formal bidding process on the turbines indicated 
that the cost of the incremental Megawatts above their 25 Mw requirement was 
only approximately $1.4MM.  In fact, the cost of the last 10 Mw was only $1MM.

3.  Rochester choose to utilize the Pratt & Whitney FT-8 (Twin Pak) turbine.  
This machine yields 52 Mw (net) at site conditions and the extra 10 Mw over 
the 42 Mw provided by the LM-6000 was only an incremental $1MM.  Rochester 
says the cost of the 52 Mw will be approximately $13.1 MM or $253/Kw.  
Installation cost would be additional. (Note: ENA's bid for the LM-6000 at 42 
Mw was $14MM and GE was at $14.2MM

4.  Rochester's board instructed them not to enter into any long term 
arrangments where they would have to sign long term PPA's etc.  Rochester 
will look to have the P&W turbine installed and will market the additional 
Megawatts on a day to day and month to month basis.


Thanks to everyone for their efforts on this prospect.  Please pass the above 
information on to anyone who would benefit from this technical and 
competitive feedback.

is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, 
recommendations, extracurricular activities, etc., that this would help my 
chances and possibly compensate for my disability.  After talking with you 
and Professors Titman, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right 
place to continue learning about energy-finance.  
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do 
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three 
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and 
Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this 
level. I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, 
this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the

In terms of your email reply,

addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are 
they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, 
it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The 
politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute 
stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more 
focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think 
they are incable
of solving the problem.

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

3272,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=

Payables

Effective today, the responsibility for Accounts Payables has been moved to Global Strategic Sourcing under the leadership of George Wasaff.  He, along with the Accounts Payable team, is pleased to announce a number of system enhancements based on your valuable feedback.

Delegation of Authority 
iPayit now enables you to identify a delegate to code, review, or approve invoices on your behalf.  The system provides you with the flexibility to:
*  Identify a delegate as a coder, approver, or reviewer
*  Define the length of time that you would like to delegate your authority
*  Select whether the delegate will assume your approval amount, maintain their own approval amount, or assume a specific approval amount

Incorrect Company Code
Incorrect company code?  No problem!  The invoice will no longer return to Accounts Payable for correction before you are able to code the invoice.  iPayit enables you to select the correct company code and continue coding.

Additional Enhancements
*  In addition to Quick Forward, you can now Quick Approve invoices
*  Invoice comments can now be easily viewed from your in-box

Introducing iPayit
With so many new systems, you told us that it was easy to confuse Payables with iBuyit eProcurement.  To help clear up that confusion, we are pleased to announce that this new and improved version has a new name:  iPayit.  
*  To access iPayit, visit the iBuyit Portal or http://iPayit.enron.com.

",Terri Terri Clynes,,
3291,"On Friday, about 3:00 pm, the ISO filed for emergency tariff changes, some of 
which are effective as of December 8, 2000 beginning HE 1600, and others that 
take effect Tuesday, December 12, 2000.  As a consequence, we no longer have 
the luxury of waiting until Jan 1, 2001 to start documenting certain costs; 
we must start documenting the verifiable costs to support supplemental energy 
and ancillary services energy bids in excess of the $250 soft cap 
immediately.  I understand that at least some of the traders have been 
informed of these changes, but I thought that it might be helpful for 
everyone to have a concise summary of the main points of this filing.  

1.  The ISO has changed the $250 hard cap on Supplemental Energy bids and 
Ancillary Service Energy bids to a soft cap.  It's similar to the FERC's 
proposed soft cap in its Nov. 1 Order.  Sellers can bid over $250 for 
supplemental energy bids and ancillary services energy bids.   If the ISO 
accepts a bid greater than $250, settlement will be as-bid and subject to 
refund if costs cannot be verified.  SCs must submit cost documentation to 
the FERC, ISO, and California Electric Oversight Board for all energy 
dispatched in excess of the soft cap.  Effective December 8, 2000.

2.  Beginning Trade Day December 12, 2000, the ISO is going to charge SCs who 
underschedule load or schedule generation that does not show up in real time, 
based on each SC's net regional negative uninstructed deviations.  (""Net 
Negative Uninstructed Deviations"" is a new ISO defined term, see below.)  
These SCs will be charged for (1) amounts paid by the ISO to purchase Energy 
from bids above the price cap, and (2) costs for Energy associated with 
out-of-market Dispatch instructions issued due to underscheduling.  

3.  Participating Generators that fail to respond to ISO Dispatch 
instructions will be assessed a penalty equal to double the highest price 
paid by the ISO for Energy for the hour in which the Generator failed to 
respond.  The penalty will not be assessed if the Generating Unit gave the 
ISO advance notice of a de-rate or outage that would limit the Generator's 
ability to respond to a Dispatch instruction.  If the outage or de-rate 
occurs in real-time, then a reason code provided with a decline or partial 
acceptance of an ADS instruction will constitute notice and no penalty will 
be assessed (subject to some additional conditions).  If the ISO has to 
curtail firm load to manage a System Emergency, the Generator will pay an 
additional penalty of $1000/MWh for dispatched energy it failed to deliver.

4.  Bilateral arrangements with the ISO, i.e., out of market purchases, will 
not be altered by the ISO's Amendment 33.

5.  From December 1-5, the ISO paid an average of $5 million per day for real 
time energy.  On December 5th, the ISO paid $36 million and on December 7th 
$81 million.  

6.  The published ex post price will not exceed $250.

7.  There is still a hard cap of $250 on Ancillary Services capacity bids.

8.  Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations:  Penalties for being short in 
real-time (either underscheduled load or generation scheduled in forward 
markets that does not show up) are based on net deviations for each BEEP 
interval, based on an SC's entire portfolio, including Load, Generation, 
Imports, and Exports. 


9.  Action:  We need to start documenting costs of Supplemental Energy and 
Ancillary Services Energy bids immediately.  Much of the groundwork for 
figuring out what information to collect has been done with respect to the 
real-time and services desks, but we need to make sure that someone is 
collecting this information on a daily basis.  For now, I am willing to be 
the point person to make sure the information is collected and filed with the 
appropriate agencies, but eventually  someone from the floor should take on 
this responsibility.  I will be here early on Monday, and we can coordinate 
our efforts then.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). ","David Oxley

We've all heard Jeff Skilling say we need to ""earn our way out"" of the current Enron share price slump.  One way we can accomplish this is by doing a better job of managing company expenses.  Ask Kevin Hannon, CEO of Enron Global Asset Services and Policy Committee member, all your questions about how we can earn our way out, together.  Tuesday, June 19 on eSpeak at 10 a.m. Houston time.

Can't make the live event?  No worries.  Go to eSpeak (http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp) now and submit your question.  Kevin will try to answer it during his event and you can read the transcript later.


After Kevin's eSpeak, we'll be opening a category in  eMeet http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf called ""Cost Savings Initiatives"" so you can continue talking amongst yourselves and helping Enron save.

 I spoke with Don at Public Service Company of New Mexico again today regarding the Schedule 9 Loss Compensation Service charges.  He re-confirmed that the market price that is part of the Schedule 9 equation (Loss Compensation Service = # MW wheeled x market price x 3%) is a market price that he obtains from his marketers.  I re-confirmed that his 'marketers' are his traders, though I do not know whether these are Long Term, Cash, or Real-Time Traders.

 He is going to talk to his traders to find out where this price came from.  I brought up the point that there has been a price cap of $91.87 in the west and asked that he bring that point forward in his discussions.

3330,"FYI.
Here is the last draft of the responses to FERC's questions.  It is still
missing a section in response to Question 2 that Mary is drafting.  I
believe that Ron has minimized the concerns that I had from the prior draft.
He is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the San Diego
litigation.  In response to Question No. 4, he is asking FERC to
specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers
market, find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine
that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory.
Anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate
the problem.  There is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get
it, that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federal
court that there has been preemption.  As a practical matter, however, our
preliminary research has shown that without a very specific intent to
preempt anti-trust laws, for example, the preemption argument may be
difficult to make anyway.  Ron and Mary clearly believe this is the one
chance we have to get FERC to make a finding.  If FERC does make the
finding, it will undoubtedly be appealed.  I do not know how to assess the
likelihood that FERC will make the requested finding, and if they do whether
it will be upheld on appeal so it is difficult for me to do a risk benefit
analysis.

 If we are going to go this route, I would take out the conditional
phrase on page 7 in the word version that reads:  ""if they were not in
violation of market rules established under the ISO's and PX's tariffs.""

Government's motion to dismiss should not be viewed as an indication that we 
believe the Government's motion lacks merit.  The Defendants have simply been 
at a disadvantage in presenting their views because the Government's motion 
is in large measure dependent upon facts, such as the adequacy of the 
submissions Grynberg made to the Government, not known to the Defendants (due 
in part, as discussed below, to Grynberg's failure to serve the Defendants 
with materials he has submitted to the Court).

        The Coordinated Defendants remain of one mind, however, in their 
belief that all of the Grynberg complaints should be dismissed for the 
entirely separate reasons that they are improperly pled under Fed. R. Civ. 
Proc. 9(b) and fail to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6).  The 
Coordinated Defendants are also united in their belief that consideration of 
the Government's motion should not take precedence over the Coordinated 
Defendants' pending motion to dismiss.  We were thus pleased to learn at the 
status conference on December 7, 2000 and from the Court's Order Following 
Status Conference that the Court proceeding ahead with a ruling on the 
Defendants' pending motions to dismiss without regard to other pending 
matters.

        Specifically with regard to Grynberg's position on discovery, as 
outlined in Mr. Figa's letter to the Court on December 8, 2000, we feel 
compelled to point out that the Grynberg request for discovery has 
implications far beyond the narrow issues raised by the government's motion 
to dismiss.  Grynberg essentially is requesting discovery on whether he or 
Wright is the proper relator on royalty valuation claims.  See Dec. 8 letter 
at 2-3.  While Grynberg is not necessarily volunteering to open himself up to 
discovery on whether he is the original source of the information he claims 
to have given to Wright's attorneys, he is specifically asking for public 
disclosure/original source discovery from Wright, and certainly the discovery 
Grynberg is seeking may well overlap discovery on whether he himself was the 
original source.

        In light of this fact, we remind the Court that the Coordinated 
Defendants have, with the Court's concurrence, delayed seeking discovery on 
and filing their own public disclosure/original source motion until the Court 
has ruled on the pending motions to dismiss the Grynberg complaints and, if 
necessary, any subsequent constitutional challenges to the Grynberg 
complaints.  That orderly progression should not be upset by the sudden 
intrusion of the Government's motion and Grynberg's request for discovery.  
Therefore, if the Court should decide that some discovery between and among 
Grynberg, Wright and the Government is appropriate to resolve the limited 
issues raised by the Government's motion to dismiss, we respectfully request 
that the Court make it abundantly clear that such discovery will in no way 
prejudice or restrict the right of the Defendants in the Grynberg cases to 
take their own discovery at the appropriate time (and assuming these cases 
have not previously been dismissed) on the public disclosure/original source 
issues.

        Finally, we respectfully request that, whether or not the Court 
grants Grynberg's request for discovery, it enter an order directing that any 
information produced in discovery or submitted to the Court in this case be 
provided to all parties alike.  This requirement is so fundamental that it 
ordinarily does not require an order of the Court to implement.  However, 
Grynberg has already submitted to this Court under seal documents that he 
claims support his position on the Government's motion to dismiss, and he has 
requested that the Clerk not make those documents available to the 
Defendants.  Absent direction to the contrary from the Court, the Clerk has 
thus far complied with Grynberg's request and denied the Defendants access to 
those documents.  This submission of documents to the Court by Mr. Gynberg is 
a clear violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(a), which requires that all filings, 
with the limited exception of motions that the movant specifically requests 
be heard ex parte, be served on all parties.  If Grynberg truly has a 
legitimate reason for asking that the documents be placed under seal (such as 
that they contain proprietary information), the Defendants will happy to 
agree to an appropriate protective order restricting access to those 
documents.  But in no event should the Defendants be denied any access 
whatsoever to documents relevant to these cases.

        The Coordinated Defendants appreciate this opportunity to present 
these views to the Court.

3343,"During today's Committee meeting/conference call among the matters
discussed involving the plan and disclosure statement were the following:

1.   Informal comments or concerns about the plan and disclosure statement
should be given to me no later than Friday, November 30th, so that we can
make appropriate modifications to enable us to file and serve an amended
plan and disclosure statement in sufficient time before the January 8th
hearing date for the disclosure statement.  Accordingly, I would very much
appreciate hearing from you in writing, by e-mail or by telephone next week
on this subject.

2.   We will invite members of the Committee along with representatives of
Duke, Dyengy and Williams (as well as others members of the Committee
identify as having a particular interest in the formulation of the plan and
disclosure statement) to participate in a special meeting/conference call
at 10:00 am (Pacific time) on December 10th to take another pass at the
plan and disclosure statement .  We will extend the invitation tomorrow or
Monday.  If you believe it appropriate to extend an invitation to a
particular participant, please get back to me as quickly as possible.

3.   We will immediately embark on obtaining information from Cal PX as to
the amounts reflected on the Cal PX books so that we can file a motion for
court approval of participant plan voting rights and claim amounts owing to
participants for voting purposes only.  Such a motion would be set for
hearing on the disclosure statement hearing date.  Under this scenario, any
participant concerned that the amount of its claim for voting purposes so
set would be understated will have the opportunity to object.  If we are
unsuccessful in getting the information from the debtor, we will
immediately file a motion on shortened time for the court  to set a special
bar date to coincide with the hearing date on the disclosure statement for
the filing by participants of proofs of claims for voting purposes only.
Following one of these two procedures will be necessary in order to
establish entitlement of participants to vote on the plan as members of
classes 6,7 and/or 8.

If you wish to discuss any of the foregoing with me, please give me a call.

3349,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FERC Settlement Developments
SoCal Ed. MOU/Plan B
The CPUC's New Rate Proposal

FERC Developments
FERC's publicly recognized autonomy regarding California power talks likely has a less public, less autonomous, role in determining the outcome of debated refunds.  The following analysis emphasizes the multiple dimensions and variables now at play in the California settlement negotiations:

The Bush Administration does have influence over what FERC decides -- especially now that Pat Wood and other Republicans are there. The influence is certainly not formal (as FERC is supposed to be an independent agency), but the commissioners generally do not issue decisions without taking the ""political lay of the land"" -- particularly regarding the positions of the White House.
Bush and Davis do not like each other (no surprise there). Communication between the Davis Administration, the White House and FERC is not free flowing. Interaction between FERC and White House is frequent -- but with Davis only on an as-needed basis. (Staff level contacts are more regular -- especially staff of the Democrat commissioners).
Administrative Law Judge C. Wagner will probably recommend a refund at under or close to $1 B -- and the Commission will not go higher than what the judge recommends. This would be for October forward. Wagner thinks there may be additional refunds ordered later.  
Wagner has also strongly advised FERC and Bush (as well as his top advisors) that they will have to put price caps on, stick with them and show real efforts to deal with this issue (even though those steps run afoul of the ""free market"" position of the Admin -- and his own members). He has a great deal of influence with Bush.  

MOU & Pan B
Late Thursday (7/12) Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg called a briefing for business community leaders regarding a new proposal to alter the terms of the Edison MOU.  The new proposal (now ABXX 82) reduces the value of SoCal's transmission system to 2 times book value (the state had previously agreed to pay 2.3 times the book value, or $2.76B).  Given the dire financial condition of the Socal Edison's parent company (EIX), the legislature now realizes that they are unlikely to see any cash infusion above the $420M already promised by EIX.  Assembly moderate Democrats led by Keeley and Hertzberg feel that a $4.5B generator refund, a profit from the State's sale of the SoCal transmission lines, and an additional $1B from a dedicated rate component are all distant, but hopeful possibilities that could fuel progress for a SoCal bail-out.  Of course, two thirds of these suggestions require FERC approval.


PG&E predictably views the new proposal ""DOA"" because it is a less attractive model to be applied in their bankruptcy proceedings than the initial SoCal MOU.  Alternately, at least one of Edison's executives indicated that SCE was confident that there would be a legislative proposal flowing from the MOU that the utility would ultimately be able to accept. He went on to describe the contours of such a proposal: It has to ""make it look like Edison is getting hurt"" to counter consumer group criticism that it is a bailout. This would be accomplished by providing something less than the $3.8 billion in under-collections. He also noted that the tricky part would be picking the right percentage below 100% -- go too low, and the generators drag SCE into bankruptcy.

CPUC Rates
The PUC will likely publish shortly (in a matter of days) a new rate agreement giving the DWR first call over the utilities on any money available for purchasing power.  If this rate agreement leaves SoCal with too little cash to operate going forward, the likelihood will increase that SoCal will file for bankruptcy protection.  It does not appear that there is enough cash for purchasing power under the current structure for both DWR and SoCal to remain solvent; therefore, in order to save SoCal from bankruptcy, the legislation governing DWR's power purchases will likely have to be revised.",SoCal Ed Pat Wood Bush Davis C.

this case the Big D)

The play was very good and I think well received.  I'd forgotten how blown 
away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY.  The cast 
members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of 
the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling).  I 
caught the third day of Corey's Jeopardy run last night here at the office 
(yes, I had to come back after the play...I love my job!).  Anyway, I'm sure 
I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl.  As a result of 
that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my 
enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely 
obliterating me (The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia).  

Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself 
since I failed to do so the last time we went.  I should let you know though 
that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right 
in the email - I mean it's such a common spelling.  So was Darren there last 
night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match?  She's a 
very fun girl.  

Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch.  
Good luck with all of the ""fun"" meetings.

3398,"With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, 
Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that 
are now subject to ROFR.  The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering 
gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to 
re-execute current contracts.  The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we 
should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.  In limiting the 
right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a 
customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely 
that its contract will be at the maximum rate.  Shippers that are not captive 
and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, 
and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers 
upon expiration of the contract. 
 
In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the 
ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.  Such shippers 
would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective 
date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal 
(assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an ""as amended"" 
basis).  Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to 
make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of 
the contract.  ",,,Commission ROFR The TW Commercial Group

Just thought I'd drop you a line to let you know that I will be in London 
this Friday through next Tuesday.  I'm visiting a friend of mine who is 
attending Sotheby's graduate program.  I know it's short notice, but I would 
love to see you at some point while I'm over there.  If you get a chance 
email me back and let me know if you're free any of those days and how I can 
get a hold of you while I'm over there.  Hope all is well.

margaritas.  I can't remember where your favorite ones are, but where ever

you, Katy, myself and whomever else may want to tag along (especially since 
it doesn't look like we'll be making it to Gruene over New Years).  Plus, if

3417,"Tony & Frazier -- several comments from TW Commercial.

Page 1:  Streamlined Credit -- what does ""interested parties"" mean? parties 
interested in bidding, or parties interested in us having a look at their 
credit ?  Probably need to make this clear; on first reading, looks like 
obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional.  (Don't we want everyone 
to get approval ahead of bidding?).

Page 2:  you state that ""individual bid transactions are kept confidential.""  
What is confidential:  the identity of the shipper?  the bid itself?  In TW's 
IOS, we post the individual bids as they come in, but do not post the name of 
the shipper.  We feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get 
a higher rate as shippers bid against each other, and likewise recommend 
online bids be posted in real time.  I notice you call them ""sealed bids"" on 
page 4 -- not true if we're going to show them.

Page 3:  why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish 
creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding?  Especially 
since we plan to attract brand-new shippers by offering this service.  Our 
credit dept. folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between 
2 and 4 on bid day.

If we're asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places, our example 
should be to 3 decimal places (e.g., $0.351).

Page 7:  ""an"" Capacity Trading Agreement should be ""a"" Capacity Trading 
Agreement.

Page 8:  So we don't appear low-tech, let's go ahead and tell shippers we 
plan to have the Request for Service and the service agreement available for 
online submittal at some point in the near future.

Also, we've never asked shippers to submit a Request for Service with each 
bid.  A shipper may bid and re-bid several times over the bidding process.  
They really only need to submit the Request for Service at the time of, or 
prior to, the first bid.  I recommend stating ""You must submit a Request for 
Service prior to making your initial bid"" so they don't think they have to 
submit a new one every time they revise their bid.

Page 9:  Under ""When TW will Respond"":  need to specify how notification will 
be sent.  

Page 14:  Column that says ""Price"" should say ""Rate"" (for a second there we 
thought you were talking about gas prices).  Also, please use example rates 
that are more realistic for TW (in the $0.240 to $0.299 would be great...)

Thanks for all your hard work on this.  I'll be here if you have any 
questions.

played about 2 series before they yanked him and put Applewhite in to put 
some points on the board.  Simms did come back in the second half and through 
a touch-down pass.  The family's good and we're all excited to see you guys

3436,"Dear Citizens' Assistance Division:

I live in the Houston Heights on the 800 block of Cortlandt.  For the 3 years 
I've lived 
there, the drainage ditch in front of my house, and several other houses on 
my street, 
have been blocked.  Any time it rains, we have standing water for several 
days 
afterwards.  I know that other streets in the Heights have the same problem.  
I have 
heard that because of the mild winter we're having, we can expect a bumper 
crop of 
mosquitos this summer.  Standing water therefore poses a health concern for 
residents 
of the Heights this summer. 

Does the City have any current plans to fix the drainage problem in the 
Heights?  Last 
year I called and requested that the ditch in front of my house be cleared, 
but got no 
response.  I hope that this was merely an oversight rather than an indication 
that the City 
of Houston has no regard for the health and comfort of its citizens. 

Any information you can provide would be appreciated.

ConEd wants to get going on an ISDA , in parallel to adjusting as necessary 
the long form for the upcoming transaction.  They believe that the ISDA will 
not be negotiated in time for when they want to execute, thus the parallel 
documents.  
Regarding the annex, the uncoming deals could potentially be swaps, collars, 
or participating swaps.
I think they are quite eager to hear our response.

3451,"Dear Sara,

Thanks for your agreement to the Set-Off language.  Do you have some
insights I can pass on to our attorney, who was wondering about the
reason behind the language in Part 5(B), the second Set-Off paragraph?

I had forwarded your comments to our Credit Manager, Andrzej
Kabarowski,
who works with our Corporate Treasury on the Cargill guarantees, but
have yet to receive a response.  I have, however, learned that our
Corporate Treasury has begun implementing a revised guarantee format
(and I am told they are absolutely inflexible about the new language).
We're trying to ascertain whether guarantees are also changing for
Cargill-Alliant, which is a joint venture rather than a subsidiary.
I will advise as soon as I know something definitive in this regard.

Unfortunately, it looks as though this Agreement will need to remain
in the ""pending"" stack for a little while longer.

Rule Changes to Implement enymex(sm)

DATE:
April 19, 2001

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number o=
f=20
rule changes, which are summarized below, to incorporate the implementation=
=20
of enymexK. These rule changes, which have been filed with the CFTC and thu=
s=20
may become effective at any time, will be implemented upon the launch of=20
enymexK.

An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchange=01,s=
=20
website.  A hard copy =01&black-line=018 version of the rule changes, which=
 shows=20
changes from the current rules, can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson=
=20
at (212) 299-2217 in the Exchange=01,s Legal Department.

The rule changes include the following areas: trading; position limits,=20
accountability and reporting; arbitration, Clearing Member obligations and =
a=20
summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access.

 Trading Rules
A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the roll-ou=
t=20
of enymexK, such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX ACCESS7 and=20
enymexK.  For example, the NYMEX ACCESS7 error trade rule has been retitled=
=20
and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system.

EFP and EFS. Similarly, Rule 6.21B and 6.21C are the Exchange=01,s rules th=
at=20
respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded=
=20
only on NYMEX ACCESS7, i.e., electricity futures contracts.  These rules wi=
ll=20
now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions.

Settlement Procedures. New NYMEX Rule 6.52E (=01&enymexK Settlement Price=
=20
Procedures=018) was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for=20
electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS7. Thus, settlement price=
s=20
generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee, or if t=
he=20
Settlement Committee was not available, by Exchange staff using the same=20
criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee.  However, one=20
difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no=20
settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid=
=20
or higher than the best offer that: (a) was for at least twenty-five (25)=
=20
contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and remained available=
=20
for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes of trading.  By=20
comparison, new NYMEX Rule 6.52E contains more general language that would=
=20
allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and offe=
rs=20
that would be protected in the settleme!
nt!
 process.

Position Limits, Accountability and Reporting.  With regard to the four=20
physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts, the amendments to NYMEX Rule=
s=20
9.26 and 9.27 provide for position accountability in the back months and a=
=20
spot month limit of 2,000 contracts for each of these four contracts.  Also=
,=20
the Exchange=01,s current hedge exemption procedures will be made applicabl=
e to=20
the enymexK contracts. With regard to the cash-settled enymexK contracts, t=
he=20
rule amendments provide for position accountability across all contract=20
months. The amendments to Rule 9.34 establish a reporting level of 25=20
contracts for each enymexK contract, the same reporting level currently use=
d=20
for many other Exchange contracts. However, NYMEX staff also has initiated=
=20
discussions with CFTC staff regarding possible regulatory relief to exempt=
=20
market participants from these reporting requirements to the CFTC for the=
=20
cash-settled contracts.

Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility. As to brokerage, ne=
w=20
Rule 9.04A (=01&enymexK Trading=018) permits brokerage to be done for enyme=
xK=20
products.  Section (C) of new Rule 9.04A clarifies that a Clearing Member=
=20
will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it carries=
,=20
even if there is a system malfunction.

 Arbitration Rules
The Exchange=01,s arbitration rules are being amended to reference Non-Memb=
er=20
enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a Non-Membe=
r=20
enymexK User or between Non-Member enymexK Users would be subject to Exchan=
ge=20
arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory basis.

 Summary Disciplinary Procedures
The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a Non-Member=20
enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system. =20
Consistent with this approach, new Exchange Rule 8.99A establishes a summar=
y=20
disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action when=20
necessary on an expedited basis.

Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue =
to=20
be subject to Exchange rules.

If you have any questions concerning these rules, please contact Christophe=

Do you and Diana have a copy of the ISDA master between ENA and Kaiser?  If 
not, here is a summary of some of the Kaiser credit related provisions:

 1. $30,000,000 cross default threshold

2. MAC Event of Default - As to Kaiser, a MAC occurs if either an Event of 
Default occurs under the 2/15/94 Credit Agreement with BankAmerica or its 
credit rating drops to B- or below by S&P and B3  or below by Moody's.  In 
each case, if they deliver collateral, no Event of Default occurs.

3. Collateral Threshold equal to ENA's Net Exposure which goes to zero if a 
MAC occurs and there is a failure to deliver collateral within 90 days or an 
Event of Default occurs.

4. $1,000,000 rounding amounts


With respect to setoff rights, I spoke with David Mitchell about this and if 
it turns out that both types of swap transactions are done with the same 
Kaiser entity but different Enron entities and the metals ISDA has 
appropriate setoff language, then we feel fairly comfortable that upon a 
Kaiser bankruptcy filing in the US, we would be able to exercise setoff 
rights.

3479,"Last week, Enron Corp. announced a 2-for-1 stock split of its common shares=
=20
for shareholders of record on July 23, 1999. This means that each sharehold=
er=20
will receive one additional share for every share owned.  The anticipation =

the impending stock split has resulted in a number of questions from=20
employees.  The answers to some of the most frequently asked questions=20
concerning the stock split and how it will affect your stock holdings are=
=20

What is a stock split?

A stock split is an increase in the number of shares of Company stock witho=
ut=20
a change in shareholders=01, equity or in the aggregate market value at the=
 time=20
of the split.  For example, one share of stock with a value of $80 will be=
=20
converted to two shares of stock with a value of $40 per share.  The Compan=
y=01,
s total number of outstanding shares will double when the 2-for-1 split=20
becomes effective.

What is the effective date of the stock split?

The split will be effective August 13.  On August 16 (the first business da=
y=20
following the split), the opening market price of Enron Corp. common stock=
=20
will be roughly half of the August 13 closing price. =20

How will the stock split affect my stock holdings?

Stock Options

If you have stock options, you will continue to hold options with an=20
equivalent value after the split.  If you have 1,000 options at a grant pri=
ce=20
of $50.00, after the split you will hold 2,000 options at an adjusted grant=
=20
price of $25.00.  The vesting provisions and the option term will not chang=

If you hold shares of Enron Corp. common stock or phantom stock through a=
=20
Company-sponsored plan (including holdings in the Employee Stock Ownership=
=20
Program (ESOP) and the Savings Plan), the shares in your accounts will=20
double.  For example, if you hold 100 shares in your ESOP account, you will=

How will the dividend rate apply to the post-split shares?

The current annual dividend rate is $1.00 per common share.  On a post-spli=

we are designating the following individuals as operating company leads with 
primary responsibility for designing and implementing government and 
regulatory affairs support for the operating companies and to serve as 
primary contacts for the operating companies:

  EBS: Scott Bolton & Donald Lassere

  EES: Harry Kingerski

  ENA: Jim Steffes

 In addition to supporting the operating company organizations, these 
individuals will report to Rick Shapiro.  Jim Steffes will retain his 
responsibilities for regulatory risk assessment and will continue to report 
to Steve Kean in that capacity.

 There are already numerous working relationships and points of contact 
between government affairs and the operating companies.  The designation of 
Scott, Donald, Harry and Jim as leads does not change that.  Rather, we are 
looking to these individuals to coordinate these activities and serve as a

3493,"Mark:  I scheduled a meeting with you at 4:30 pm today to discuss the MG 
acquisition, in particular, MG London, Inc. (a U.S REGULATED NYMEX clearing 
member, FCM, CTA).  NO ONE is looking into this from a US regulatory/legal 
perspective and I think it should be the swap group.  Enron's ""regulated"" 
product areas are metals (since MG clears its own trades on the NYMEX/COMEX 
and has FCM/CTA status) and potentially agriculture if we (some Enron entity) 
choose to become a regulated ""ATOM"" (ag trade option merchant).  From a legal 
perspective, I think we should have a ""whitepaper"" drafted by Sullivan & 
Cromwell, and, it should include an analysis of the MG London, Inc. existing 
situation.  This would tie into the ag regulation.  Also, have you thought 
about ENA and MG as NYMEX members and whether we keep both designations, 
whether we move all/part of ENA's existing clearing business to MG (and 
perhaps eliminate the need for margin/brokering arrangements such as Paribas, 
etc.) and any other related issues?  For efficiency purposes, Donna Lowry has 
asked to join us.  Donna and I had a conference call this morning with 
Justin, Paul, Jon Barrett, Sheila Glover and Trena McFarland to figure out 
who's on first (with MG).

Also, I am attaching an update of my workload.  I have reached the breaking 
point and I need more help (even with Jason's help on brokerage agreements

How was it envisioned that ConfirmLogic would handle the difference between the Term of the Underlying Transaction and the exercise period of the swaption?

Leslie,
I modified the ERCOT definitions to make them consistent with the latest draft you sent me.  There are two floating price definitions that appear to have additional variables in them.  (The Megawatt Daily Index Daily and the Megawatt Daily Index Forward.)  How were these additional variables to be handled in ConfirmLogic?

Sara, 

You had asked me to retrieve from Bear Stearns a copy of our initial/unused guaranty that you (or Stephanie?) sent to them.  As you know from the emails that I forwarded to you, I had contacted their counsel several times asking that she return the guaranty.  Anna finally called me back today to say outright that they lost both the executed version and any copies.  Anna suggested that as a remedy we could draft some document memorializing its status.   Let me know if you want me  to forward the voicemail or if there is anything I can do to help.

3548,"Hello Sara,

I received your voice message and called you back but you are not available.

My understanding of where we stand is not consistent with yours.  Here is my 
understanding:

Guaranty: Yes, I got the guaranty executed and have it in my possession.

Assignment  Agreement:  No, we do not have a final draft.  As I mentioned on 
Friday, the last version that Anna sent did not have all of the all of the 
edits/changes I had recommended to her implemented.  In particular, the 
arbitration language had not been changed and there were some grammatical 
edits.  I refaxed my comments today; Anna agreed to implement them and I am 
awaiting her draft.  (Anna may not have gotten some faxes on Thursday or 
Friday because her fax number changed when she changed building locations 
last week).  

Account Agreement: Yes, you are correct that Anna has to send back a revised 
draft.  She and I have been clling each other every hour.  Anna said that she 
would get back to me in two hours or so after her meeting on another matter.

Authorized Traders List:  Stephanie had originally taken on this task and 
sent me an email indicating that the list was complete.  Last week, Stephanie 
indicated that the information upon which she relied was no longer in the 
database.  Therefore, there is some confusion as to who the corporate 
officers are.  I called Richard Sage, with whom Stephanie has been in 
contact, for assistance.  He has not called me back so if you had further 
suggestions on how to proceeed, please let me know.

Account & Tax Forms: I have the requisite form -- the same one I have used 
for the same tasks for other new Enron entities - in my possession and am in 
the process of filling them out.  

Logistics: You indicated in your voice message that you were not sure whether 
I had thought logistically about getting the agreement executed.  Let me 
reassure you that I have.  In light of the above, I did not maintain the view 
that all the documents would be ready for signature by noon particularly 
because (1) we do not have in our possession final versions of two of the 
three agreements and (2) I determined on Friday that the Authorized Officers 
List might now be outdated.  I received some emails today disclosing how to 
proceed re: sending the document.  However, as I confirmed with you on 
Friday, I spoke with Mike Bruegel on Thursday and confirmed where to send the 
documents.

When you are available, please let me know so we can update and resolution on 
how to proceed on any outstanding matters.

Mark has clarified to me that:

1) The initial structure, in terms of what John Greene desires (in order to be
'up & running' as soon as possible) is to use the structure described in the
letter drafted by Jacqueline Hamilton (which John will convey to you directly
internally, per Mark Freeman's representation to me), where he will be a 
direct
employee of the U.S. entity which is already a client of Instinet in the U.S.

2) Once Enron decides on the longer-term corporate structure which they wish 
to
use in the future, subject to our concurrence, we will 'transition' from the
state originally desired by John Greene.

This is my and Mark Freeman's comprehension at present.  If you have any other

William Stuart on the FX desk will offer the Product to Enron canada Corp on 
an internal basis only. The GTC will be an 'internal only' GTC that we use 
that tells any external customer that may inadvertantly access the internal 
trade that the transaction is freserved for internal trading only; the only 
radio button will be a ""REJECT GTC"", which further prevents an external 
customer from transacting.

Stuart will post a Fixed Price price that represents the USD/CAD Exchange 
rate on Trade Date. The Fixed Amount will be a CAD amount equal to volume 
multiplied by Fixed Price. The Floating Amount will be a CAD Amount equal to 
the volume multiplied by the Index, where the Index is a Floating Price equal 
to the USD/CAD.

There are several arguments as to whether this should be classified as a 
Forward or a Financial transaction. Our effort was to arrive at something 
that would be easily understood by the market in the event that we begin to 
offer this product externally.

As I have said from the outset, before we send them an ISDA, we need to 
obtain from their Bermuda counsel a legal opinion that gives us the 
assurances that we need that (1) all of the Bermuda transactions have been 
duly authorized and are enforceable by us against AIG and (2) we have a 
perfected security interest in any collateral that has been posted by AIG to 
us.  A form of the legal opinion is attached to the confirm.  As to point #1, 
we have no way of confirming this on our own and I understand from Brent 
Hendry that because of various peculiarities with Bermuda law, our only way 
of gaining comfort on this is through the legal opinion process.  As to point

tickets from the Travel Agency in the Park (TAP), which is the preferred

insurmountable.  See below, a list of the contracts Enron has negotiated with 
some of the airlines.  Whenever possible, plan to purchase tickets at least 
3-7 days in advance.  Often the pre-purchase savings outweighs the potential 
switching fee. The travel agency is also able to give you a better price for 
hotel reservations through the Hickory rate, which is cheaper then the 
corporate rate.  TAP's phone number is 713-650-8080 (web address:

3644,"Republican Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Republican Plan B proposal:
? Encourage direct access for consumers.  (The problem with this, however, is 
that these direct access deals would not have a dedicated rate component, and 
too many might undermine the cash flow and credit worthiness of the bonds.)
? The Republicans will ""suggest"" that generators take a 30% haircut.  ""We 
think this is doable.""
? The Republicans strongly oppose purchasing the transmission assets.
? Restore the invetor-owned utility model for generation.  They would 
establish a dedicated rate component for construction of native generation by 
the utilities.  They would grant ratepayers equity interest in these plants.
? Resolve the QFs' financial issues.

Assemblyman Cox commented afterward that the Republcans have been trying to 
work on a bilateral basis with the Democrats on these issues, but they feel 
""frozen out.""  Moreover, he senses the Democrats moving back toward having an 
option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets, which the Republicans oppose.

Democratic Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Democratic Plan B:
? The Democrats are formulating a Plan B that incorporates the Governor's 
MOU, the Nation Plan B and other ideas that they have.  This plan reportedly 
has not yet been introduced into the legislature yet because it is still 
being finalized and the Democrats are not certain that it will work.  
Specifically, the option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is 
reportedly still being debated.  Some Democrats reportedly believe that this 
may be unnecessary.
? The details of the plan are reportedly as follows:
- Set aside the $3.1 bilion undercollect in a separate account funded by a 
dedicated rate  component.
- The generators can either get a check instantly from the bonds for 70% of 
their  claim or they can try to get up to 100% of their claim adjudicated 
through a  dispute.
- This plan could be used as a template for going to the bankruptcy judge to 
strike a deal  for PG&E.
? Sources indicate that the Democrats are developing a post-petition plan in 
cast SoCal files for bankruptcy, including the following:
- The state would buy both utilities out of bankruptcy.  It then would sell 
of pieces of  the utilities to various private-sector buyers, but with a 
lifetime stipulation on  how they will be run.
- Some Democrats reportedly believe the state could do this with as little as 
$5 billion if  it assumed the utilities' debt and got a cram-down by the 
bankrutpcy judge to quell  the protests against such a plan that would very 
likely erupt.  Democrats reportedly  believe that the Judge Montali would 
support this idea.

it is not so obvious when we start developing businesses overseas. Just to =
illustrate this point, I am attaching a presentation recently delivered in =
Brazil, which was very well received by Minister Parente, the energy czar. =
It basically states that if Brazil wants to be serious about privatization,=
 electric reform and sector expansion, we have to respect contracts. The go=

in Brazil right now (Annex V, Wholesale Agreement, MAE price, Itaipu Excess=

The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due- ""While the amount of=
 such refunds is not $8.9 billion as claimed by the State of California, th=
ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billi=

The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July 5, which wa=
s summarily rejected by the State of California, and that the five separate=
 offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also =
rejected.=20
 =20
Refund Effective Date- Refund effective date of October 2, 2000, for sales =
in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX.  The Chief Judge's recomme=
ndations do not go beyond that date.  ""Spot market"" sales are ""sales that a=

Evidentiary Hearing- ""The differences between what the State of California =

ial issues of fact. The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds =
involve factual disputes.  Thus, the Chief Judge recommends that a trial-ty=

the methodology set forth below.  Because of the urgent need for an answer =

Methodology- The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t=
he June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order =
to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS=
O's and Cal PX's spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O=

Heat Rate- The actual heat rates, rather than hypothetical heat rates (asso=

Gas Cost-  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based =
upon a daily spot gas price.  ""In the event that the marginal unit is locat=

O&M Adder-  An adder of $6/MWh for O&M should also be included with the cal=

Emissions Costs- Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma=

Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order, ancillary service=

same as set forth in the June 19th Order.=20

Maximum Price for Non-Emergency Hours- Somewhat unclear.  The Chief Judge r=
ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat=

USA: Enron seen facing long road to restore confidence.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. moved in the right direction by releasing more detailed financial data and tackling problems at peripheral businesses, but the energy giant still has a way to go to make Wall Street happy, analysts said Wednesday. 
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Tuesday. The company took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments, measures Enron executives said credit rating agencies were comfortable with.
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said on Wednesday he was ""not thrilled"" by the announcement during a conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings. And for good reason. 
Moody's Investors Service subsequently issued a statement saying it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. 
""There appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved,"" Barone said. 
The writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the company's operations went some way to appeasing Wall Street after a tumultuous year in which Enron's stock lost about two-thirds of its value, but analysts said they were not about to let Enron off the hook just yet. 
Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters said he remained concerned about Enron's quality of earnings and cash flow. 
Winters said he believed Enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and writedowns, but was unable to do so without putting its credit ratings at risk, which could adversely affect some of the company's financing arrangements. 
""Problem assets and overvalued assets on the balance sheet remain, particularly overseas,"" he said. 
One such asset is Enron's 65 percent stake, valued at $1 billion, in the Dabhol power plant project in India, which has been stalled because of a long-running payments dispute with its only customer, a local utility company. 
Enron's stock closed down $1.64, or 4.85 percent, at $32.20 on Wednesday. 
For the year to date the stock is down about 61 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index , which has fallen some 24 percent over the same period. 
Enron was a Wall Street favorite last year when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the company's broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen sharply this year as sentiment toward broadband soured, new chief executive Jeff Skilling resigned after just six months in the job and wrangling continued over the Dabhol power plant project.

USA: UPDATE 1-RTO seen key to boosting New England power supply.
By Scott DiSavino

10/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the U.S. Northeast hinges, in part, on setting up a Northeast Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). 
RTOs are predominantly for-profit groups established to bring all of a region's high-voltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the grid.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which oversees the interstate wholesale power market, believes RTOs will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers, in turn improving service and driving down rates. 
""If FERC can drive the Northeast RTO to closure in a reasonable period of time, it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation,"" Enron Corp.'s managing director of global government affairs, Rick Shapiro, told Reuters. 
Houston-based Enron is the nation's top energy marketer. 
""How and when the RTO gets implemented will radically impact the market. It's crucial to the development of the market in New England,"" Mirant Corp. spokesman Ray Long told Reuters. 
Energy provider Mirant, of Atlanta, has 1,400 megawatts (MW) of generation in New England. The company is currently adding another 700 MW to its Canal station in Massachusetts. 
""Once we get the permits for Canal, we will reassess whether to proceed with the project. A big part of that assessment will depend on the RTO process,"" Long said. 
THE NORTHEAST RTO 
FERC wants to see four super-regional RTOs created in the U.S. - in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. 
Several regions have taken long strides toward developing RTOs, including a not-for-profit model proposed in the Midwest and rival for-profit plans vying for FERC approval in the West. 
FERC Chairman Patrick Wood, seeking to spur the development of RTOs, favors giving utilities until Dec. 15 to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market, though the commission has not voted on this plan. 
The Northeast RTO will include New England, New York, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) region and possibly parts of eastern Canada. 
FERC said it wants the Northeast RTO to be built on the PJM market platform and to include the best practices of the New England and New York markets. 
PJM Interconnection, which operates the power grid in parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and Washington, D.C., is the nation's only fully functioning RTO. 
""The process FERC set in place to establish one RTO in PJM, New York and New England is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market,"" Long said. 
Long said Mirant determined a single Northeast RTO would save more than $440 million annually by eliminating the ""artificial borders that now exist between New York, New England and PJM."" 
An administrative law judge, acting as a mediator for FERC, considered three proposals for creating the Northeast RTO. 
The three plans were proposed by interested parties, including Mirant and Enron, and the region's grid operators - the New York Independent System Operator (ISO) in New York, ISO New England in New England and PJM. 
Last month, the judge asked the FERC to decide who will govern the Northeast RTO and what the timetable is to put the plan in place. The judge favored a plan put forward by the New York ISO and ISO New England. 
""If FERC implements the RTO plan proposed by PJM in 2003, consumers could save $1.5 billion ... $440 million a year ... over the New York/New England plan, which would not be implemented until 2006,"" Long said. 
Under the PJM plan, PJM would overlay its current market model across the entire region, while adopting some of the best practices of the other markets. 
""Although nothing is perfect, PJM is widely accepted as the best market in the region. New York and New England, which are younger markets, are still works in progress with some bugs to work out,"" Enron's Shapiro said.

Enron Seeks Replacement For AGA's Gas Storage Report

10/17/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE), the nation's largest natural gas trading company, isn't ready to let the regular report on U.S. natural gas storage inventory die, a company executive said Tuesday. 
Because the American Gas Association has said it will discontinue its weekly gas storage report at the end of the year, Enron would like to see another organization take over the report, said John Lavorato, president and chief executive of the company's Americas Wholesale Services unit.
Speaking at a meeting with analysts, Lavorato said the storage report is important for the gas industry to keep track of industry fundamentals. 
Without a regular report on storage gas inventory, the gas industry can expect less frequent but greater price changes than seen in the past, he said. 
The Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration publishes monthly data on gas storage, but the information isn't as timely as data the AGA reports each Wednesday. 
The EIA issued its latest gas storage report Oct. 9. It showed the amount of gas in storage at the end of July. The data comes from reports filed by operators of gas storage facilities. 
It also showed estimates of the amount of gas in storage at the end of August and September. Those estimates are generated by a computer model. 
Wednesday's weekly storage report from the AGA will show estimated inventory as of Oct. 12. The AGA estimate is based on reports from gas storage facilities. That data is then run through an AGA computer model to generate the report. 
Lavorato said he would like to see the EIA, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America or consultants like PIRA Energy Group, an international energy consulting firm, take over reports on storage inventory. 
INGAA is an industry trade group representing gas pipeline companies in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. They manage many of the gas storage facilities. 
Lavorato would like to see a new report based on data that could be audited, he said. 
He said he thinks the AGA has found itself ""in the middle of something it didn't want to be in."" Originally intended for use within the gas industry, the weekly AGA report has become high-profile, and is even watched by equity markets, he said. 
Some industry participants have criticized the AGA report, wondering whether it can be manipulated by companies that supply data to the AGA. Many of those companies also trade physical gas and gas futures. 
When the AGA has revised storage figures from previous reports, gas prices have sometimes reacted wildly.

On the weekend, May 4- 6, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce unanimously adopted 
the Toronto Board of Trade's  position paper re market opening on November 1, 
2001.   The OCC is the umbrella organization of all local chambers of 
commerce/ boards of trade across Ontario.  The Toronto Board of Trade 
position paper largely follows the Enron position paper re market 
opening.                              b) Elyse Allan, Louise Verity and Jan 
Carr (all representing the Toronto Board of Trade) met with Minister Wilson 
and Judy Hubert on Tuesday, May 8. Wilson explicitly asked the BOT to ""keep 
up the heat"" on a November 1 opening. Wilson was evidently very impressed by 
the OCC resolution.                       c) Some concern was expressed  by 
David McFadden (head of SAC and BE's lawyer)   that  OPG may not put the 
fossil units on the block until August, since the Ministry of the 
Environment's new emissions regulations will not be promulgated until that 
time.  Paul might want to raise this with Gord Homer: I don't see why OPG 
would have to wait until August  to begin the process; the substance of the 
regs are known now, even if they are not law until 
August.                       d) A fight is brewing between the City of 
Toronto and the Province regarding the Hearn facility.  The City wants to 
tear it down  as part of their waterfront plan but the Province is pushing to 
keep it as a generation facility of some type. The IMO has evidently prepared 
a report on the issue that has not yet been made 
public.                                        e)There was a push from some 
taskforce members (particularly Jan Carr) to adopt, as a transitional 
measure, some type of controls to limit exports and control prices in 
Ontario.  This was a non-starter with most of the members of the taskforce 
and that initiative will not go forward. I have undertaken, instead,  to give 
the BOT some talking points that they can use in answering questions about

3673,"The Senate Energy Committee held an oversight hearing today on siting 
impediments to energy infrastructure.  The four witnesses were Jerry 
Halvorsen of INGAA, William Nugent of Maine for NARUC, David Cook, general 
counsel of NERC, and Stan Szwed, vp-transmission of FirstEnergy Corp.  The 
hearing was well attended by committee Republicans, but only Sen. Bingaman 
and Sen. Landrieu on the Democratic side, and then only briefly.

Highlights

NARUC's Nugent urged the Committee to move swiftly to confirm Wood and 
Brownell to FERC, noting their confirmation hearing is tomorrow.

Consensus that energy infrastructure is not able to keep up with projected 
energy demand, both gas and electric.

Surprising willingness (even among western Republican senators who are 
normally pro-states rights, pro-private property rights) that Congress should 
at least seriously consider, if not implement, some form of federal authority 
over power transmission siting.  Specifics were not nailed down, with some 
senators expressing more support for treating electric like FERC already has 
power over natural gas, while others were inclined more toward a FERC back 
stop or last resort authority when state decisionmaking breaks down.  The 
drift was certainly toward some enhanced federal role.

NERC released is Summer Assessment today that is more pessimistic than 
California ISO on the extent of expected rolling blackouts and shortages this 
summer.  NERC seees a capacity shortage in the Pacific Northwest this 
winter.  While NY/NE is adequate this summer, Cook says it bears watching 
because of bouts of high heat in the region and a high level of unplanned 
outages that often occur in the region in the summer.

Chairman Murkowski engaged in a series of questions with INGAA's Halvorsen 
designed to lay the blame for the natural gas capacity problem to California 
and corresponding high price levels on the actions of LDCs in California not 
supporting expansion of interstate pipelines.  Halvorsen's testimony includes 
a chart of specific cases where LDCs intervened.  In his verbal testimony, 
Halvorsen singled out Sempra as a source of opposition, including Sempra 
filings against expansions by Transwestern and Kern River.

Chairman Murkowski got Halvorsen to say that the actions of the California 
LDCs and the intrastate nature of all gas pipelines in California effectively 
denied California consumers the benefit of open access for natural gas.  
Murkowski implied he would entertain a change in the Natural Gas Act as it 
relates to the status of interstate pipelines going in to California.

Sen. Domenici joined the increasing chorus of members of Congress raising 
questions about why natural gas prices are low at the wellhead for his 
producers in New Mexico, but so high into California.  He asked the panel who 
is making the money in the differential, but none of the witnesses wanted to 
tackle the question.  This is just one more indication of the growing 
interest in the natural gas aspects of the California situation.","Jerry

Per our conversation today, I am emailing you the pertintent documents 
outlining our efforts in NY.  The key document you will want to read through 
is the ESES Message Action Memo (it's about 15 pages and it details the 
comprehensive  PR effort).  The other important attachment is the Concept 
Board for the potential ad campaign.  (THIS IS ONLY A CONCEPT BOARD AND WILL 
PROBABLY BE TWEAKED, BUT IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW AN AD MIGHT LOOK/SOUND.  
THE PR FIRM SORT OF MIXES RETAIL AND WHOLESALE MAREKTS BUT WE CAN FIX THAT).

I have left a message for Howard to call Jim D'Andrea, who has represented 
Keyspan at the coalition meetings, so that Jim knows you are calling his CEO. 

The coalition has been discussing this effort since Feb 1st.  Edison Mission, 
Keyspan and Morgan Stanley want to contribute money only and remain anonymous 
(all for different reasons).  They made their concerns known to the group 
from the start, but other companies hopped on that bandwagon last week.  The 
take away from today's meeting (Keyspan was not present) was as follows:

Our coalition is small (10 companies)
If 3 companies are out front (enron, dynegy and mirant) and 7 companies only 
contribute and attempt to remain anonymous - the reporters will ignore our 
message and write the story about the ""anonymous donors""....not a good way to 
launch a coalition effort.
We would also be ignoring the $42,000 of research we paid for which concluded 
that people want to hear from ""honest brokers"", they want to know who we are, 
what we advocate and they want to be educated on what it is we're saying.
Today, the group agreed to go back and get a full commitment for 
participation from their companies.  Without full commitment and up front 
participation the group can't go foward.  
Even Edison Mission is going back and asking to fully participate (deal with 
any criticisms now rather than later).
No one believes that Morgan Stanley will commit to full participation given 
they are a unique company in this mix (but companies seem to be okay with 
them peeling off).
Thus, we need to ask Keyspan to rethink their role in the coaltion.  Can they 
go beyond a contributing role and be up front?
We'd love to have them fully participate, and we need to pose the question 
one last time. (Keyspan was not present for the PR presentation last week 
either so I highly doubt they have seen the plan in it's entirety (attached)
Coalition members agreed that they love the plan that our PR firm has 
presented.  This is a unique opportunity - one we don't want to miss when so 
many companies are aligning themselves with coalitions in preparation for the 
summer.  
(Phil Harris sent a letter to all PJM member companies asking for their 
participation in a similar effort). And IPPNY is also implementing a PR 
effort in NY (albeit a more narrow effort).

I'm back in Houston at 11:00 Thursday if you have additional questions.  

THANK YOU!

3676,"Here is a brief synopsis of my view of LDC gas hedging, which I just chewed 
Harry's ear off explaining:

1.  Commission needs to understand how hedging works.  In a typical market 
situation, the supplier of a good negotiates with the consumer, who can 
explain to the supplier what his appetite for risk and term is, and then the 
supplier can come up with the appropriate pricing and term (eg. all spot, 
fixed price, pricing within a band). In other words, the hedge reflects the 
customer's specific wants and needs.

2.  When a utility tries to hedge for its amorphous group of bundled sales 
customers, it lacks the specific knowledge of  the appetite for risk that 
group has, and in fact, the appetites will be all over the place.  Therefore, 
the hedging will not be perfect.  If a utility locks in some pricing at term, 
there is always the risk that a hindsight regulatory review will find that 
the price was too high in light of later market developments, or that too 
much reliance was placed on spot, which may have moved up.  What utilities 
need then, is the guidance to hedge, and then freedom from hindsight review.  
(This gives ENA a good market for its hedged products and removes regulatory 
risk involved with those products.)

3.  When the utility hedges, it faces potential stranded costs, which arise 
if load leaves.  Thus, to mitigate the potential and size of this problem, 
the hedged portfolio should only be dedicated to those customers for whom 
leaving for transportation is not a real option (residential and small 
commercial).  If larger customers are on sales service, their rates should 
reflect market index prices, as they do have the ability to leave, and spot 
pricing removes the stranded cost and undercollection concerns.  (It also 
gives us something easy to market against).  In other words, we need 2 PGA's, 
one for captive customers and one for non-captive customers.

4.  To make this 2-part world work, there must be in place an effective 
transportation program that enables larger customers to shop for their own 
supplies in the competitive market.

I hope that all is well. Believe me, I am not trying to interfere with your 
vacation, but here is a quick update of what I have learnt over the weekend.

Ken Ley had a meeting with the Indian Finance Minister in New York over this 
weekend.  No specific news of the outcome, but they believe here that our 
message was ""we want out, facilitate it, or we shall go out very noisily"".  
Ken Ley, and possibly Jeff, are expected here in India in the week of July 
8th.  No confirmation as of yet.  Perhaps you would like to consider that you 
and I are to be here too.  
I expect to have a meeting with Wade either tomorrow (Tuesday), or after to 
discuss the suggested plan (outlined below, and based on if renegotiation, 
then semi permanent support, if exiting, then a week every 4 to 6 weeks).  

Of course, I look forward for your advise, comments and suggestions.

3683,"Ken Lay met with the Vice President last week for about 45 minutes to discuss 
the Administration's National Energy Policy.  During the discussion, Ken 
raised the importance of including LNG in its policy.  Ken emphasized that 
any national energy policy should encourage investment in infrastructure for 
natural gas and power, and said that at current gas prices in the US LNG 
imports are financially attractive.  Ken said that Enron is making a 
significant investment in global LNG business and much of this investment 
will be in the US and South America.  The Vice President, while not affirming 
our position, seem very receptive to the message.  As we were departing the 
White House, Ken saw Secretary Colin Powell.  Ken spoke to the Secretary 
about our LNG project and gave our LNG briefing paper to the Secretary.  We 
also followed up his discussion with a letter from Ken to Secretary Powell, 
thanking the Secretary for looking into the Venezuelan LNG project.","Ken Lay Ken

was reported by Charles Yeung's in his note on Tuesday's Inter-RTO Coordina=

""Harvey Reed, Constellation Power, suggested that FERC impose a standard ta=

rent proposals, but would limit their ability to diverge from a single mark=
et model.""

=09In addition to the standard model, there needs to be a deadline for eith=
er filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff.  Without a ""feet to=
 the fire"" feature, nothing the grand stall will continue.  In arguing for =
a standard model, the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we sho=
uld specific modifications to address our concerns.  On the transmission ri=
ghts issue, for instance, a simple ""don't allocate"" solution won't work.  T=
he lack of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the la=
ck of information and to the way the rights are defined.  If as Harvey Reed=
 suggests, RTOs can submit alternative approaches, at least there will be p=
ressure to get moving.  I have not discussed this idea with West Power. =20

=09It then occurred to me that FERC  is unlikely to impose a standard tarif=

s a moot point, since  I doubt that they would do so without creating a rec=
ord.  There are two possible down sides to a rule making.  (1)  The outcome=
 of a rulemaking is something of a crap shoot.  The incumbents have a prett=
y good record in the past, of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of good=
ies such as the native load exemption in Order No. 888.  There is a also a =
distinct risk that PJM's ICAP or transmission right allocation process is g=
iven blessed status, which will make revision of them later to be a huge up=
hill battle.  (2)  The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on curr=
ent  RTO discussions.  The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rule=
making creates an urgency  to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule c=
uts off options from a new the standard for review.  The uncertainty prior =
to the issuance of Order No. 888 in fact had that effect in the West.  On t=

I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. 

We're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.

3709,"A police officer pulls a guy over for speeding and has the following  exchange:
Officer:
May I see your driver's  license?
Driver:
I don't have one. I had it suspended when I got my  5th DUI.
Officer:
May I see the owner's card for this  vehicle?
Driver:
It's not my car. I stole it.
Officer:
The  car is stolen?
Driver:
That's right. But come to think of it, I think  I saw the owner's card
in the glove box when I was putting my gun in  there.
Officer:
There's a gun in the glove box?
Driver:
Yes  sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed the woman who
owns this  car and stuffed her in the trunk.
Officer:
There's a BODY in the  TRUNK?!?!?
Driver:
Yes, sir.
Hearing this, the officer  immediately called his captain. The car was
quickly surrounded by police, and  the captain approached the driver
to handle the tense  situation:
Captain:
Sir, can I see your  license?
Driver:
Sure. Here it is.
It was  valid.
Captain:
Who's car is this?
Driver:
It's mine,  officer. Here's the owner' card.
The driver owned the  car.
Captain:
Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if  there's a gun 
in it?
Driver:
Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it.
Sure  enough, there was nothing in the glove box.
Captain:
Would you mind  opening your trunk? I was told you said there's body in it.
Driver:
No  problem.
Trunk is opened; no body.
Captain:
I don't understand  it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you
didn't have a license,  stole the car, had a gun in the glove box, and that
there was a dead body in  the trunk.

I was wondering if you would do me a favor.  You have sent a couple of 
packages to Jeff's home by UPS or FedEx.  Unfortunately, Jeff is never there 
to sign for them, so the packages are delayed in getting to him as we have to 
track them down.  UPS is very good about rerouting to the business address, 
but FedEx won't reroute without the permission of the sender (i.e., you).  

At any rate, in the future if you would send packages to Jeff at Enron Corp., 
1400 Smith Street, EB5008, Houston, Texas, 77002, I would really appreciate 
it.  And of course, anything marked ""confidential"" is opened only by him.

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way 
too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the 
results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the 
parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

I spoke to Ginette Berthel at Maclaren Energy, regarding your e-mail.

Regarding point #2 below, Maclaren would like its cross default threshold
amount to be US $50 million.  They are fine with the Enron threshold being
at US $100 million.

Regarding the CSA, since Great Lakes Power is giving a $12 million parental
guarantee, the collateral threshold amount for Maclaren should be $12
million.  Your e-mail below states that Enron' parent will be giving a $30
million parental guarantee.  My understanding is that this guarantee was to
be $15 million.  Regardless, I believe that Maclaren is only willing to
accept $15 million of credit risk from both Enron entities.  Therefore, the
threshold amount should be $15 million.

Please e-mail or call me to discuss.

Alternative 1 - File ""ripple"" refund claim
Advantages: (1) testimony goes in record and is available for briefing/argument;(2)procedural risks are minimized.
Disadvantages:  (1) implicitly undermines primary position that refunds are unjustified; (2)witnesses are available for cross-examination; (3) ALJ may reject depending on ruling on proposed order.

Alternative 2 - File ""offer of proof"" showing ripple claims  
Advantages: (1)next best thing to testimony; (2) keeps burden and focus on initial claimants', (3) only marginally compromises procedural position if ALJ accepts proposed order.

Enron Fights To Find Near-Term Sellers,But Still Trading
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to market sources. 
""It's not getting any better,"" said one major energy broker.
Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying from it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer. 
Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also are trading with Enron. 
The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker said. 
Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering. 
""They've been cut off from so many people,"" said one electricity trader. 
Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions 

An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25% of the one-month-ago level. 
The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago. 
""We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility,"" Thode said. 
Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed. 
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt. 
But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing. 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating ""evolving."" Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.

So I have recruited all of you to help out in the Enron Elves program. The 
program is designed to help raise funds to buy gifts for a family and 
currently, we (West Desk) has sponsored three families. Our family has two 
kids with a single parent (mother). There is an 11-year old daughter and 
8-year old son.

I hope that everyone will do their best to help out. We basically need to 
raise money by asking people we know and even companies that some of you 
might have ties with and then we go shopping and finally wrap the presents 
and deliver them to the family. 

The money should be in by Friday December 15th and the gift wrapping is 
scheduled for Tuesday December 19th. We will go shopping for the gifts in 
between then.

We need to keep track of the amount of the donation, name and address of the 
person that donated so that they are able to use the donation as a tax 
deduction.  If you have any other questions or ideas about gifts or raising 
money, feel free to stop by my desk or email me.

3893,"I have conferred with industry representatives on the CFTC's suggestion.  We 
have a problem with it from a couple of perspectives:

1.  Although NYMEX is the benchmark for pricing of a few energy commodities, 
most of the pricing of transactions is done based on price reporting services 
such as Platt's, Megawatt Daily and Reuters.  These services collect 
information on transactions from industry representatives and report usually 
on a daily basis benchmark prices for a large number of energy commodities.  
This activity has never been regulated by anyone.  Obviously, these price 
reporting services have provided valuable price information to the 
industry.   We do not see a need for regulation of price reporting whether it 
from a price reporting service or an electronic trading system.

2.  We are concerned that the manner in which the CFTC would regulate/oversee 
price reporting would be very awkward and difficult.  The drafting of such a 
provision would be complex and the discretion it would give the CFTC to 
potentially regulate through price reporting would be troubling.

We are very interested in achieving the exclusion that the draft legislation 
currently provides.  We would be prepared to discuss the matter further in 
the hope of maintaining the exclusion.  Please let me know what you think.

3896,"FYI
",,,FYI
3897,"My comments are included (in section 1 only)
",,,
3898,"I have one principal concern in respect of one of the three structures called 
the ""Commodity Transit Trade"" structure.  The concern relates to the passing 
of title to the metal forming the subject-matter of the contract.  Under this 
structure, MCC sells metal to the counterparty (""Counterparty"") on a spot 
basis with payment deferred (Contract 1).  Counterparty simultaneously sells 
back the metal to MCC, also on a spot basis, but not on deferred payment 
terms (the spot payment received Counterparty therefore constitutes the 
finance) - Contract 2. 

The concern is that, as the transaction has been explained to us, there may 
be a delay of two or three days between (i) legal title to the metal passing 
to Counterparty under Contract 1 and (ii) legal title passing back again to 
MCC under Contact 2.  There is therefore a risk that an event could occur in 
the interim which prevents title passing back to MCC.  The most likely event 
would be the insolvency of the counterparty, but other events (eg supervening 
illegality due to the imposition of sanctions) are conceivable.  More 
specifically, a liquidator of Counterparty could seek to disclaim (or set 
aside) Contract 2 if the market price of metal has increased during the 
interim. 

Consequences

The consequences stem from the fact that the metal forming the subject matter 
of these financings will typically be on the high seas bound for a third 
party (ie not counterparty). MCC will have a contractual obligation to 
transfer good title to the metal to that third party.  If title to the metal 
remains vested in Counterparty then Enron cannot fulfil this obligation to 
the third party.  Conversely, if MCC completes the sale to the third party, 
MCC cannot be said to have passed good title to Counterparty under Contract 1 
above.  In other words, MCC could be sued for breach of contract for failure 
to transfer good title to Counterparty or the third party, on the basis that 
it has sold the same goods twice.  

The likely downside is that Enron could be forced to perform both to 
counterparty and to the third party at a loss (or to perform to one and pay 
market damages to the other).  However, there is a remote possibility that 
punitive damages could also be awarded against MCC on the basis that it has 
sold the same goods twice, or possibly on the basis that the transactions are 
not ""genuine"" sales of goods, but a sham (this danger should not be 
exagerated and is mitigated by the choice of English law as the governing law 
of the contract). 

A further consequence would of course be that the financing itself would not 
be capable of being completed, with the attendant loss of fees/commissions 
etc, but this is probably a minor consideration.

Mitigants?

There are possible mitigants of the risk highlighted above, as follows:

Cross default - Contracts 1 and 2 will include cross default language to the 
effect that if Counterparty does not execute Contract 2, Contract 1 is 
cancelled.  Care should be taken to ensure that this language is wide enough 
to cover all circumstances (eg if Counterparty has ""executed"" but not 
performed Contract 2, would the cross default apply?).  More significantly, 
even if the cross default language works contractually, it may be overriden 
by the bankruptcy laws of the Counterparty, as invoked by Counterparty's 
liquidator. In other words, the liquidator may be able to ""cherry pick"" 
Contract 1 while renouncing Contract 2.  This could be checked on a 
jurisdictional basis, if considered appropriate.

As mentioned, English law, as the governing law of the contracts, may 
mitigate the risk described above to some degree, but local insolvency law in 
the country of Counterparty could override the parties' choice of English law.

Probability - As a matter of crude probability, it may be regarded as fairly 
unlikely that, within a narrow window of a few days or so (i) a Counterparty 
goes bankrupt (ii) in a rising market and (iii) its liquidator takes the 
point and insists on performance of Contract 1 while renouncing Contract, 
particularly in light of the fact that Counterparty does not have posssession 
of the metal and possession would be difficult to obtain.  This may be why 
the issue appears not to have arisen under past transactions.  It is however 
no assurance that these circumstances will not arise in the future.

Conclusion

There is a real risk of loss to MCC should the Counterparty go bankrupt after 
Contact 1 above, but before performance of Contract 2.  This risk is most 
accute in a rising market and is relatively unlikely to materialise in a 
given case.  If it does materialise, it is hard to assess definitively the 
possible loss involved, but this would be likely to be, at a minimum, the 
difference between the then prevailing market price and the price of the 
metal under Contract 1.

Please (anyone) let me know if you would like to discuss this before we move 
to a formal DASH.

Thanks

Paul

3899,"Good morning everyone,

Thankyou for responding promptly.

I think this draft better captures the Master / GTC approach though I thought 
we were going to change the title of the Internete Trading Access Agreement 
to something reflecting 'Password Application'.  

Also the wording which has been added at the end of the agreement is 
obviously only US specific - does this mean that we are going to have to have 
different Agreements on the page depending on the location of the person who 
clicks on it? Obviously the fact that the law is different on the written one 
is OK as can be altered by jurisdiction but the same issue does arise on the 
online agreement.   This causes issues so I'll need a respond immediately on 
this and would appreciate Mark and Justin discussing this today.

For information, I attach Schwab's agreement from the web which is quite 
simplistic in look and feel - could we adopt any of this approach - no 
WHEREAS is a good start.

My Reaction: I will be speaking at a conference in Sedona, AZ (not known for 
its great sailing)

Possible Date: November 3 - 8
My Reaction: I have another speaking engagement in NYC right after that 
(makes it sub-optimal for me) plus Bill can't go

Possible Date: Thanksgiving
My Reaction: You guys can't make it

Possible Date: New Years (travel Sat. 12/30, pick up boat 12/31, back in the 
office Mon. 1/8/01)
My Reaction: Everybody can go - and since Monday is a holiday only 4 vacation 
days used for a full week of sailing - Perfect in every way (if we can get 
flights and a boat - I haven't checked this yet)

Possible Date: Later in 2001
My Reaction: Works for me but I hate to put it off so long

So my preference is to try for New Years and fall back on early November as a 
second choice.  If you want to go for less than a week now and a full week in

We would prefer that the ROETA be executed off-line.  It is on that basis
that we have sought the opinion of overseas counsel.  That said, you may
form the view that online execution of the ROETA is no different to the
operation of a website with a hotlinked disclaimer.  On that basis you may
decide to execute the ROETA online.  We have some concerns regarding
security issues because of the distribution of a password without a
supporting agreement, however, you may form the view that this is a minor
risk.

3920,"Dear All,

In the course of current ISDA Master Agreement negotiations with an 
Australian counterparty it has come to my attention that the ISDA netting 
opinion for Australia specifies that certain Sections of the ISDA Master 
should not be altered; otherwise reliance on the opinion, and close-out 
netting, could be jeopardised.  In particular the opinion specifies that 
Section 2(a)(iii) should not be altered.  

Enron has a standard alteration to Section 2(a)(iii) in Part 5 of its 
standard form Schedule, viz.  

""(a) Conditions Precedent.  The condition precedent set forth in clause (1) 
of Section 2(a)(iii) shall not apply to payments owed by a party if the other 
party shall have satisfied in full all its payment obligations under Section 
2(a)(i) and shall at the relevant time have no future payment obligations 
whether absolute or contingent, under Section 2(a)(i).""

Obviously, in the case of Australian counterparties this condition precedent 
should not be included in our documentation.

In addition, there are a number of other countries (including Germany, Italy, 
South Korea and Switzerland) where the effectiveness of the ISDA netting 
opinion presupposes that certain Sections of the Master, including Section 
2(a)(iii), are not altered in any material respect. To that end I would 
suggest that our standard condition precedent does make a material alteration 
and that it should not be included in ISDA Master Agreements with 
counterparties trading from these jurisdictions.

Certainly from the London end, I think that when we start negotiations with a 
new counterparty we should check the ISDA opinions to ensure that we don't 
trip ourselves up.

Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted 
into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master 
database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft 
form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to 
manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the 
Australian agreements plugged into the system.

This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of 
contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take 
a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with 
and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a 
global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take 
on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if 
someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and 
asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in 
another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the 
same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort 
on the counterparty front.

In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no 
way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.

Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside 
auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.

For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master 
agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. 
Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract 
records and approval for online trading.

For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our 
Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside 
legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the 
confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The 
database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have 
found helpful.

You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator 
requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you 
get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can 
figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..

Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?  That would be a good 
time for me to do a full review of this database with you.  ",David Mark Taylor Mike Neves,,"Legal and Credit the

3937,"I have now had a chance to review the initial language describing the load index that was being discussed in the flurry of e-mails this morning.  My preference would be to keep the language as consistent as possible with the language for the pricing index.  Given that the actual hourly load is also posted in the ""Actual/Forecast"" table from which we derive the pricing index (under the column ""Actual AIS Demand""), I would propose that we simply reference that same table and the appropriate column and use the arithmetic average of the actual load for all hours.  In doing so, the products will be consistent.  I also am not sure that we would then need to have a definition of ""Load"", as the formula for calculating the ""Floating Amount"" is made certain without the requirement to define ""load"".  My proposed wording is as follows:

The Floating Amount shall be the arithmetic average of the hourly Alberta Power Pool load for all hours beginning with HE 0100 (12:00 am) and concluding with HE 2400 (12:00 am) in each Delivery Day as published (in final, not forecast, form) by the Power Pool of Alberta in the table entitled ""Actual/Forecast"" reported for the applicable Delivery Day in the column for ""Actual AIS Demand"" and in the row(s) for the applicable hours, on the Power Pool of Alberta internet web page currently located at www.powerpool.ab.ca/Market/Reports/ActualForecastReportServlet.  ""Delivery Day"" means a day during the term of the transaction.

I assume that it is most appropriate to use an average of the daily loads as opposed to, say, the actual load for each hour or a monthly average.  

Let me know what your thoughts are regarding this language.

Below is what I am proposing as a response to Kal and Andy's concerns over 
the ICE claim ""most liquid.""  Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks.


""ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION
ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT
CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION

Kal -

I understand the concern raised; however, I am not so sure that the claim 
made is a ""legal"" claim.  The analysis of whether or not this type of claim 
can be made is really based upon advertising principals and generally, at 
least at a federal level, governed by the Federal Trade Commission.  The 
analysis of the validity of the claim is the concern in this arena and would 
focus predominantly on an analysis of the following items:

1.  whether or not this type of language is ""puffery"" for sales purposes or 
if it is a claim requiring substantiation
2.  what the term ""most liquid"" is intended to convey (e.g., EOL uses 
""world's largest"" to convey both size and power in the market)
3.  how ""most liquid"" is defined - what standard, measure or industry 
analysis has been conducted by ICE to establish that ""most liquid"" has a real 
meaning and one that, when applied to EOL, would indicate that EOL is not as 
""liquid"" as ICE. 
4.  whether or not the use of the term ""most liquid"" is misleading, thereby 
causing any harm

Notice that the advertising analysis will not focus on perceived damage by 
Enron based upon restricted access.  This analysis, at least to me, would be 
a separate and distinct issue.  If Enron is not being given full access to 
the site simply because there is no equity ownership, the analysis of damage 
to Enron would be moreso a possible antitrust type analysis by the Department 
of Justice/courts rather than a false advertising type analysis.  This 
analysis would be based upon issues related to the ownership structure of the 
site (including the sharing of profits and fees amongst owners), the policies 
and procedures established by ICE to ensure fair treatment to all who access 
the site and the effect restricted access may have upon competition (e.g., 
other sites being able to enter the market and compete).  The last point 
would also have, as a component,  the extent to which Enron and other 
non-owner users would not have a secondary or alternative source for the 
information.

Needless to say, it may be difficult under the antitrust type analysis for 
Enron to claim harm when EOL boast of being the ""world's largest website for 
global commodity transactions.""  Further, if other non-EOL sources are 
available to Enron to obtain the same information contained within ICE, it 
would also be difficult for Enron to show harm as a result of limited access.""

to continue this trend, I am soliciting guidance as to the proper 
administration of the Risk Management Policy regarding employee trading.  

The following is the verbatim language from the Policy:

""Section VII.  Miscellaneous 
   Employee Trading.  No employee may engage in the trading of any Position 
for the benefit of any party other than an Enron Company (whether for theri 
own account of thr the account of any third party) where such Position 
relates to (i) any financial instrument, security, financial asset or 
liability whch falls within  such employee's responsibility at an Enron 
Compay or (ii) any other commodity included in any Commodity Group.""

Administration of this policy has been limited to the efforts of Mark Taylor 
and Tana Jones in the Legal Department primarily consisting of employees 
""confessing"" to trading certain products.    In the past, if the product has 
been one that Enron does not trade, the employee is told that it is ok.  If 
it is a product that we do trade, then they are informed to comply with 
policy.    Restrictions on the trading of financial instruments, such as 
equities, interest rates and foriegn exchange have been limited to those that 
are currently managing those books for an Enron Company or those who might 
have access to information that was not in the public domain.

Generally, we have found that people have traded yen, S&P futures, metals and 
agricultural products.   Now that we have authorized the trading of a wide 
variety of agricultural products and metals, we may need to advise employees 
not to trade them (immediately, soon, never???).   We may also consider 
changing the policy or altering our enforcement methods.

Please advise your guidance as to how to proceed.

Based on advice received from Chevez, Ruiz, Zamarripa y Cia., S.C. (our 
Mexican tax counsel based in Mexico City), payments made by a Mexican 
counterparty to ENA pursuant to any of the Transactions will not be subject 
to Mexican income, withholding or value-added tax.  Consequently, the 
Transactions (described in the attachment below) are approved by the ENA Tax 
Department for trading through EnronOnline with Mexican counterparties.

Jaime and Agustin:  Please keep in mind that our previous discussions 
regarding ENA's activities  in Mexico (i.e., that its activities in Mexico 
should continue to be limited such that it is not subject to Mexican tax) 
also apply to ENA's EOL transactions with Mexican counterparties.  Thus, 
Enron employees' activities in Mexico on behalf of ENA (or any other 
non-Mexican Enron entity), whether through EOL transactions or otherwise, 
should be limited to general marketing of Enron products; no negotiations 
regarding any product should take place in Mexico on behalf of ENA, and no 
contract should be executed in Mexico on behalf of ENA.

difference in the outcome, I don't really see the point.  Let me know if you 
disagree.

While a commodity forward contract which contains an asymmetrical default 
provision clearly does not have the characteristic of net settlement, we do 
not believe that Statement 133 is appropriately applied to any contract which 
requires the making and taking of delivery of a physical commodity absent a 
default, regardless of whether the default results in a termination payment 
which may be payable to the defaulting party.  An event of default and 
resulting termination of a commodity contract can have far reaching negative 
implications for the defaulting party well beyond the terms of the contract 
itself (e.g. damage to reputation and credit, triggering of cross-defaults, 
etc.).  ",Paige - I,,

3971,"My analysis is that forcing the scroll through the entire agreement provides 
additional comfort that the counterparty has actually looked at the agreement 
and knows to what they are agreeing - it is that much more likely that the 
contract will be enforceable.  It is certainly not necessary from my point of 
view that the document take up the entire page rather than appearing in a 
smaller window with a scroll bar down the side - in fact I think that looks 
much better.  It would be acceptable from a legal point of view if the 
""agree"" button appeared as in the example below as long as it didn't work 
until the agreement had been scrolled through.  I personally think that would 
create more problems from a commercial point of view since many 
counterparties will try to click on ""agree"" as soon as it appears without 
reading the agreement and get frustrated when it doesn't work right away.  

David - do you agree?

It seems to me that you used to chair a seminar put on by the Euromoney
people on swap documentation.  We used to send our new lawyers and more
experienced paralegals to the introductory course and the more
experienced lawyers to the advanced course.  It appears that Euromoney
is no longer putting this on.  Are you doing something similar through

3978,"Thanks Vela.  My office address is fine.

Just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be:

1.  I'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems generally.  What happens if it jams in a blow?
2.  Are the heads both electric?  Will they operate manually if you lose power?
3.  The boat seems remarkably well equipped.  What sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise?
4.  How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements?
5.  Finally, and I suppose of least importance, I'm not thrilled with the teak-look deck or the blue cabin sole.  Any hope of a manufacturing change?

Thanks again and I'm looking forward to seeing you in Ft. Lauderdale!

Following our discussion of last Thur., we need to prepare the term sheet for 
Citizens. I want to focus on the TW deal first.  There are a number of things 
that I hope you can get from the desk by early afternoon my time, so we have 
time to do the term sheet.

I want to show them a structure that would give them right to call on gas 
each day.  What there be a demand charge?  What would be the Gas Daily 
adder?  High end of the range?  Mid point?  What would the demand charge be 
for mid-point of the range?  We would also compensate the desk to receive a 
demand charge equal to the full monthly cost of the lateral.  The desk should 
love that much of the structure.  Try to get some numbers from Janie.

 I have had numerous conversations with Citizens and TW.  TW will do the deal 
but want their liability limited to $140,000 year.  Citizens wants this 
liability increased to $1,000,000.  We could do this by buying insurance.  We 
might subcontract with TW to do this so the services deals is between ENA and 
Citizens. We would need to increase the demand charge to pay for this 
increase in laibility.

Once we know all our costs, we would bundle this together and then increase 
the demand charge for orig.

LEGISLATIVE STATUS REPORT

			 The Second Regular Session of New Mexico's 45th
Legislature ended at noon on Thursday, February 14 (Valentine's Day?), and
the final disposition by the Legislature of the monitored bills that would
specifically affect our industry is as follows:

			CS/H 165-Tribal Capital Improvements Tax Credit:
Introduced by Representative Ben Lujan, Dem., Dist. 46 (Santa Fe). A House
Taxation & Revenue Committee substitute bill received a ""Do Pass,"" was
passed by the House and was sent to the Senate, where it was referred to but
withdrawn from the Senate Conservation and Finance Committees, passed by the
Senate and sent to the Governor. This substitute bill would provide that one
liable for the oil and gas emergency school tax on production from Jicarilla
Apache tribal land will have a credit each month equal to the lesser of the
tax that is exclusively dedicated to fund capital improvement projects on
the Jicarilla Apache tribal land (but not commercial buildings) imposed on
such production by the Jicarilla Apache Nation, or 0.7% of the taxable value
of such production. The burden of showing entitlement to this credit would
be on the taxpayer, who must furnish proof of payment of the Jicarilla
Apache tribal capital improvements tax. 

			HB 230-""Indian Country"" Defined: Introduced by
Representative Leo C. Watchman, Jr., Dem., Dist. 9 (McKinley & San Juan).
Would broadly define ""Indian country"" under the New Mexico statutes. This
bill was referred to the House Rules & Order of Business Committee, where it
died.

			HB 309-San Juan Oil and Gas Field Training Program:
Introduced by Representative Nick Tinnin, Rep., Dist. 1 (San Juan). Would
appropriate $300,000 to San Juan College for Fiscal Year 2003 and subsequent
years for an oil and gas field training program at the college that includes
certification and training for well, pipeline and drilling technicians and
field workers. This bill was received a ""Do Pass"" in the House Business &
Industry Committee and was sent to the House Appropriations & Finance
Committee, where it died.

			CS/H 388-Tax Credit For Produced Water: Introduced
by Representative Robert W. Burpo, Rep., Dist. 23 (Bernalillo). A House
Business & Industry Committee substitute bill received a ""Do Pass"" and was
sent to the House Taxation & Revenue Committee, where, as amended, it
received a ""Do Pass."" It was passed by the House and sent to the Senate,
where it was referred to the Senate Finance Committee, where it received a
""Do Pass."" Then, it was passed by the Senate and sent to the Governor. This
substitute bill, as amended, would provide that a refinery, natural gas
processor or person who operates an oil or gas well who produces water from
oil or gas drilling and production from a depth of 2,500 feet or more below
the surface or refining crude oil or processing natural gas may take an
income tax credit of $1,000 per acre-foot of produced water (not to exceed
$400,000 per year) if the party delivers the water to the Interstate Stream
Commission at the Pecos River in compliance with the New Mexico Water
Quality Act, to contribute to delivery obligations pursuant to the Pecos
River Compact, and subject to other conditions, and that the Interstate
Stream Commission shall indemnify the party from future liability.

			HB 423-Additional Natural Gas Pipeline Systems
Study: Introduced by Representative Donald L Whitaker, Dem., Dist. 61 (Lea).
This bill is identical to SB 369, received a ""Do Pass"" in the House Energy &
Natural Resources Committee and was sent to the House Appropriations &
Finance Committee, where it died. 

			SB  16-Lea and Carlsbad Conservation District Study:
Introduced by Senator Carroll H. Leavell, Rep., Dist. 41 (Eddy & Lea). Would
appropriate $500,000 to New Mexico State University for Fiscal Year 2003 for
a study by the Lea and Carlsbad Soil and Water Conservation Districts of
issues related to the use of water produced by oil and gas exploration from
""deep underground."" This bill was found germane by the Senate Committees'
Committee, received a ""Do Pass"" in the Senate Conservation Committee, and
was sent to the Senate Finance Committee,  where it died.

			SB 283-Tribal Capital Improvements Tax Credit:
Introduced by Senator Leonard Tsosie, Dem., Dist 37 (Dona Ana, Otero &
Sierra). This bill is identical to HB 165, was found germane by the Senate
Committees' Committee, and was sent to the Senate Indian & Cultural Affairs,
where it was withdrawn and sent directly to the Senate Finance Committee,
where it died.

			SB 345-Well Workover Projects: Introduced by Senator
Leonard Lee Rawson, Rep., Dist. 37 (Dona Ana, Otero & Sierra). Would amend
the Natural Gas and Crude Oil Production Incentive Act to expand the
definition of ""well workover project"" to include the installation by the
operator of workover equipment that is intended to substantially increase
the life of the well and that has been approved and certified by the OCD,
which approval shall be granted if the OCD determines that the equipment
will substantially reduce operating costs, thereby increasing the life of
the well and its recoverable reserves. This bill was found germane by the
Senate Committees' Committee and sent to the Senate Conservation Committee,
where it received a ""Do Pass"" and was sent to the Senate Finance Committee,
where it received a ""Do Pass,"" but it died in the Senate.

			SB 369-Additional Natural Gas Pipeline Systems
Study: Also introduced by Senator Leavell. Would require the Legislative
Council to assign an Interim Committee to study the economic feasibility and
the costs and benefits of financing, constructing and operating a natural
gas pipeline to transport New Mexico natural gas to additional markets. This
bill was found germane by the Senate Committees' Committee and sent to the
Senate Conservation Committee, where it received a ""Do Pass"" and was sent to
the Senate Finance Committee, where it died.

			HM 37-Pipeline Safety Program: Introduced by
Representative James Roger Madalena, Dem., Dist. 65 (Bernalillo, Cibola &
Sandoval). Would ask the Pipeline Safety Bureau of the Public Regulation
Commission to apply for funding from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety
in the Department of Transportation, for authority to carry out a safety
program on interstate gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities and to
become an agent of the federal Secretary of Transportation in regard to such
facilities issues, and work to protect the safety of New Mexico residents
and visitors by developing a rigorous pipeline safety program and taking
action to prevent future pipeline accidents. This memorial was referred to
the House Energy & Natural Resources Committee, where it received a ""Do
Pass, and it was passed by the House. 

			HJM 17-Coordinated Oil & Gas Permitting Process:
Introduced by Representative Patricia A. Lundstrom, Dem., Dist. 5
(McKinley). Would request that the Department of Environment, the Oil
Conservation Division and the federal Bureau of Land Management cooperate in
the development of a coordinated permit process for oil and gas activities.
This memorial received a ""Do Pass"" in the House Energy & Natural Resources
and Business & Industry Committees, was passed by the House, and was sent to
the Senate, where it was referred to the Senate Conservation Committee,
withdrawn and died. 

			SJM 83-Treat Produced Water For Recycling: Also
introduced by Senator Leavell. Would request that the State Engineer, the
OCD, representatives of the oil and gas industry and the Department of
Environment jointly study the issues raised by the potential for treating
produced water so that it may be put to beneficial use and report their
findings and recommendations to the appropriate legislative committee by
December 1, 2002. This memorial was referred to the Senate Rules and
Conservation Committees, but it died in the former.

			The Governor has until March 6 to either sign or
veto the bills that were sent to him by the Legislature.

4048,"Gov. Davis announced today his appointment of Mike Peevey as Commissioner at the CPUC to replace Com. Bilas who resigned last week.  Mr. Peevey is the former President of Southern California Edison and as such advocated deregulation.  Consumer group advocates are concerned about his past record and oppose his nomination which is subject to state Senate approval.  Below is an article from the Sacramento Bee.  gh


Davis names ex-Edison chief to PUC
But the action stirs anger: 'Our worst nightmare,' says a consumer lawyer.
By Stuart Leavenworth -- Bee Staff Writer
Published 5:30 a.m. PST Wednesday, March 6, 2002
Gov. Gray Davis has appointed a former president of Southern California Edison to a state panel charged with regulating Edison and other public utilities.
Davis said Michael R. Peevey would bring ""more than three decades of experience"" to the Public Utilities Commission -- experience that immediately came under fire from the state's consumer groups.
Mike Florio, a lawyer for The Utility Reform Network, said Peevey has a record, both in government and in business, of pushing for higher rates for small businesses and residential consumers.
""This is a our worst nightmare,"" Florio said. ""It is like putting Dr. Kevorkian in charge of a nursing home.""
Others were more supportive. D.J. Smith, a lobbyist who represents large industrial energy users, lauded Peevey as someone ""who understands all sides of the energy business"" and will be fair to all sides.
""I think he will be objective about Edison because he doesn't owe Edison anything,"" said Smith, noting that Peevey left the Southern California utility nine years ago.
The husband of Assemblywoman Carol Liu, D-South Pasadena, Peevey replaces PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas, who resigned last week. Bilas was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson.
If confirmed by the state Senate, Peevey will solidify Davis' control over the PUC, a five-member board that now includes three of the governor's appointees. It also comes at a time when the commission is fighting with the state's other large utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., on terms for PG&E's reorganization in federal bankruptcy court.
PG&E spokesman Ron Low declined to comment on the appointment Tuesday, but last year Peevey was involved with a handshake deal that might have helped PG&E avoid bankruptcy.
Hired by Davis to negotiate with the utility, Peevey reportedly struck a deal with PG&E Chairman Bob Glynn that would have let PG&E charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity. But other Davis advisers objected to the deal and the negotiations ultimately fell apart.
For three years, Peevey was president of Edison International and Southern California Edison before leaving in 1993 in a reported power struggle with company Chairman John Bryson.
Peevey then became a public affairs consultant and then president of NewEnergy Inc., an energy service provider that was sold in 1999 to AES Corp. After working as an adviser to Davis, he had been CEO of TruePricing Inc. and also has served on the board of Excelergy Corp., an energy software company.
With his new six-year PUC job, Peevey will regulate not only electric utilities but telecommunications giants, water companies, natural gas supplies and other industries.
After a review by PUC lawyers, Peevey will have to divest holdings and resign from positions that could cause a conflict, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said.
Peevy's appointment was one of two Davis made Tuesday. He also appointed John L. Geesman to the board of the Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state power grid.
Since 1985, Geesman has been the managing director of fixed income banking for RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. in San Francisco. He once served on TURN's board.
Consumer groups, which had pressed for a meeting with Davis for the past week, said the he may have timed his Election Day appointment of Peevey to minimize negative media coverage.
Maviglio called that claim ""ludicrous."" Today's papers, he said, ""will be some of the best read this year.""
