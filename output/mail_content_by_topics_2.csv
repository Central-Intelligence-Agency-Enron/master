I quickly plotted the short and the long curves and the following come out in 
your face.

1. Is this policy easing going to be a one shot ( a la 98 ) followed by a 
quick pick up in economic activity, or is this going to be a more deeper 
situation. That is the big one.  The curves vote for a small road-bump which 
will be rectified by a couple of eases over the next 6 months. Something the 
Fed can handle easily and quickly. This is most likely NOT going to happen - 
this is not a 98 and things are going to play out differently.  There are a 
number of other possibilities.

2. The current slow-down is two pronged - capital spending slowdown from 
businesses ( especially on IT with the internet bust ) and the consumer 
spending slow-down , possibly because of the stock market wealth effect. Both 
of these have already hit the durable goods section.  This reversal is 'Real' 
which takes longer to turn then the 'Financial crisis' hence there is good 
possibility we see a protraction of this weakness and even coupled with the 
fed eases this is going to take longer than six months to get better.

3. The new administration is going to take this as a good opportunity to 
force tax cuts. How does the Fed look at those ? Will the Fed balk and be 
less aggressive in the rate cuts expecting the tax cuts , will it ignore 
them. That makes the equation harder. It also to some extent argues that 
longer term rates go up if these tax cuts materialize. But on the shorter 
term who that effects Fed policy will have profound effect on the curve.


All these favor a steeper curve. The 2-5 at -23 ( -6 on swap curve ), 2 -10 
at -15 ( 18 on the swaps ) and 2-30 at 19 bps ( 37 bp) should all be steeper 
as market realizes the length of this ease cycle.  If this cycle lasts an 
year ( the final and the last ease happens next Dec ) then the 2-10 should be 
40 bp positive, as the market realizes that.

One day,  the police raided a whole group of prostitutes at a sex
party in a hotel and the girl was among them. The police took them
outside and had all the prostitutes line up along the driveway when
suddenly, the girl's grandma came by and saw her granddaughter.

Grandma asked,""Why are you standing in line here, dear?"" Not
willing to let her grandmother know the truth, the girl told her grand
mother that the policemen were there passing out free oranges
and she was just lining up for some.

""Why, that's awfully nice of them. I think I'll get some for myself,""
and she proceeded to the back of the line.

A policeman was going down the line asking for information from
all of the prostitutes. When he got to Grandma, he was bewildered
and explained, ""Wow, still going at it at your age? How do you do it?""

Grandma replied, ""Oh, it's easy, dear. I just take my dentures out,
pull the skin back and suck them dry."""

REACTION TO GOVERNOR BUSH'S STATEMENT

RE: What Gore needs to consider:
""The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like, and
that Gore requested.  Bush still won counting with Gore's
rules... [Gore has] to consider where reasonable people in the
center are going to look at this, and say, 'Guys you had your
shot, the count, the recount - they changed the rules for you
and you still did not win.'  It's time to be magnanimous.

RE: Governor Bush's Speech:
""...the tone...was perfect...

""There was a persistence and a determination in what
[Governor Bush] said, but it was also incredibly conciliatory.
It was the first kind of conciliatory speech that anybody has
given in this, and that probably goes to peoples hearts.""

     - Bob Woodward on Larry King Live, CNN, 11/26/00

STATEMENT BY GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH

The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones.  As our
nation watched, we were all reminded on a daily basis of the
importance of each and every vote.  We were reminded of the
strength of our democracy - that while our system is not always
perfect, it is fundamentally strong and far better than any
other alternative.

The election was close, but tonight, after a count, a recount
and yet another manual recount, Secretary Cheney and I are
honored and humbled to have won the state of Florida, which
gives us the needed electoral votes to win the election.  We
will therefore undertake the responsibility of preparing to
serve as America's next President and Vice President.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Shortly after I arrived here some 19 days ago, I said here in
this very room that the election process in - Florida and in
the country as a whole - needed to conclude with fairness and
finality.

I suggested that everyone step back, pause, and think about
what was at stake.  I warned that there might be no reasonable
end to the process of counts, challenges and contests if it
slipped away from us.

So here is the account of the past 3 weeks.

STATEMENT BY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER BOB CRAWFORD
Democrat Member of Florida's Election Canvassing Commission

Thank you, Madam Secretary. Let me first commend you on the job
that you and your office have done during these last almost
three weeks since the election.

This has been a tough election. It has not always been pretty.
But we got the job done, and we got it done right. People
called me and say--particularly from out of state--and say
what's going on down in Florida, and I have to keep reminding
people, the only thing that's going on here is that we've got
a razor-thin election for the most important job in the world.

And that's all it is. After all the jokes, after all of the
anguish, we've just got a close election. And any state that
had to go through this would've had the same problems, I think,
that we have had.

But I think it's over. It should be over. And maybe that's the
important word there, ""should."" You know, Yogi Berra once said,
""It's not over till it's over.'' Well, it's over, and we have a
winner, and it's time to move on.

There's one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have
enough legal talent to keep this tied up through  Christmas.
But one thing the lawyers can't do for us and one thing the
courts can't do for us: They can't bring this country together
again.

And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight,
it's going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this
country together again, and I hope we can get on with that work
soon.

And I'm proud of the job that we've done here in the state.

GORE JUST SPINNING ABOUT SUPREME COURT, SAYS EXPERT
Fox News Channel, 11/26/00

FOX NEWS' BRIT HUME: ""...does the Gore team not have something
to work with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court
coming up on Friday.  That-that creates sort of a period of
continuing, a sort of unfinality if such a word exists.""

NATIONAL JOURNAL'S STUART TAYLOR: ""...Unless I'm missing
something that is completely hollow spin.  There is nothing
what so ever, I think-that the Supreme Court of the United
States can do for Al Gore.  They could do some things for
George W. Bush, but Al Gore hasn't asked them to do anything
except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done.
But I don't think he's in the position to say, ""Oh by the way
could you order some more recounts?""  So I think there is
nothing, if...Gore runs out of ammunition.  Which I think he
may well do, before the Supreme Court of the United States gets
to a hearing.  I think he has to give up, because there's
nothing...""

42,"SIPPING VODKA
A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly
speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous
on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water
glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning
of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He
proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he
found the following note on the door:

1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not
referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.
8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he
said,""Take this and eat it for it is my body.""  He did not
say, Eat me""
12.  The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,""
13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub
thanks for the grub, yeah God.
14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at
St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.


The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings
good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the
chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.
Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You
will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain
is not broken.

""I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is to try to
please everyone...""

communicate the final ranking from the PRC process to your supervisor.  I 
received a copy of the rankings from Charlene on Friday while I was on 
vacation.  I will be communicating the final rankings to each Associate's 
supervisor today.  It is your supervisor who will the one be to give you your 
performance review and the ranking.  In your case, I would guess that Jean

your review.  --Sally

Here is the agencies opinion on your project at Spraberry.  How do you feel
about testing one of those engines?

"
60,"Kenny,
             I have found some information on this report, I have a copy of
the report that was filed for ""99"".

The reporting requirements are contained in Part 191 of Title 49 of the
Code of Federal Regulations,""Transportaion of Natural and Other Gas by
Pipeline: Annual Reports and Incident Reports."" Each operator of a nonrural
gathering system or of a transmission system must submit an annual report
Form RSPA F 7100.2-1 for the preceding calendar year not later than March
15. Be sure to report TOTAL Miles of pipeline in the system at the end of
the reporting year, including additions to the system during the year.

Please contact me on this and we can get it filled out and turned in. We
must retain a copy for our records which will be stored at NCL.
Thanks,
                Scott

How well do you know our Code of Ethics?

""It is a condition of employment that each employee accept the responsibility of complying with the foregoing policies.  The Company will require each employee of the Company to complete and submit a statement in a form designated by the Company pertaining to such employee's compliance with the policies set forth in this booklet.  The Company reserves the right to request any employee to complete and submit such statement at any time or as frequently as the Company may deem advisable.""
(Enron Code of Ethics, July 2000, page 62)

What does that mean?

In layman's terms, everyone employed by Enron agrees to all the policies and standards listed in the current Code of Ethics (July 2000).

Who does it apply to?

The Code of Ethics applies to all employees, third party contractors, guests and licensees of Enron.  Additionally, employees are responsible for their family members and/or personal household who use, own, or have access to Enron's communication services and equipment -- including telephones, fax machines, computers, computer modems, long distance telephone services, cell phones, voice mail, pagers, e-mail, mail and delivery services.

What about my privacy?

Don't expect privacy when using Enron's equipment or services -- whether the activity is business or non-business related.  For example, don't use Enron's equipment to send or receive personal messages that you don't want monitored or accessed by the government, third parties or Enron.  In a nutshell, if you want privacy, don't use Enron's equipment.

Are there repercussions for non-compliance?

Yes.  An employee who violates any of the policies in the Code of Ethics is subject to disciplinary action, including suspension or termination of employment, and can include legal action if Enron believes it to be appropriate under the circumstances.


If you have any questions or comments about IT security or a related issue, please feel free to put them into eMeet (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf) under the ""IT Security"" category.  We'll monitor the site and respond to you there."
62,"Joe, presented below is the first memo I sent out concering the air permit 
issue:

[Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 
and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status 
of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.]

I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to 
another group (compliance) in the air permit section.  They strongly 
suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, 
Director of the ADEQ.  I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ 
compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back 
from her.  Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again, 
tomorrow.

Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to 
have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air 
permits:

 all earthwork
 trench construction and piping tie ins
 all foundation and building construction
 installation of ancillary equipment

This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may 
allow us to do.

The EPA contact for the Sta. 3 and 4 air permits: permit engineer  Roger 
Cohn      (415) 744-1238
      Supervisor  Geraldo Rios    (415) 744-1259

The ADEQ contact for Sta. 1 and 2 air permit permit engineer  Shudeish 
Mahadev (?)   (602) 207-2323
      Director   Nancy Wrona  
 "
63,"Call me.

713.853.9351"
64,"Roger, thats great that the public notice for station 3 and 4 air permits 
will initiate on October 4.  I really appreciate your work and effort on 
this. I will be looking forward to reviewing the rough draft for both of the 
permits during the first week of October.....

"
75,"Felicia,

In general, you are correct that the salary basis test must be met before 
someone can be classified as exempt.  However, because there are certain 
exceptions to the salary basis test (for example, licensed attorneys do not 
have to meet that test), it depends on what the employees are doing as to 
whether this situation creates a problem under the FLSA.

My recommendation would be to obtain information about the jobs performed by 
these 29 employees so that we can determine whether there is an issue.  If 
they do not fit within one of the exceptions, we probably should have them 
affirmatively report time so that hours worked over 40 can be paid at the 
overtime rate. You would use the hourly rate they are paid to determine the 
overtime rate.  If they are not working over 40 hours in a week, it will not 
be an issue.

Let me know if you have questions.

Michelle

79,"	After we spoke, I was in a meeting with Michelle Cash and we discussed the prospect of implementing the Voluntary severance  program in the U.S.
 She advised me that she would be meeting with David Oxley in the a.m. and would discuss this matter with him. We both agreed that we should hold off on conforming  edits to the Europe's Voluntary severance program until we have confirmation that that is the direction we are going in the U.S.  Additionally, there are legal issue that we need to address relating to  New York and in California law relating to the  implementation of this plan and its administration for your company that would take a day or so to address with outside counsel, as well.  Likewise, the calculation of severance as it relates to this program in the U.S. needs to be addressed before we can conform the document for use.  Accordingly, I will wait to hear from Michelle in the a.m. and will contact you as soon as I know the proposed direction of the Company for U.S. based employees and other detail.

Thanks,

2001-10-26 15:00 (New York)

Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch Neg

Fitch-NY-October 26, 2001: Fitch has placed the ratings of
Marlin Water Trust II's (Marlin II's) approximately $915 million
senior secured notes due 2003, and Osprey Trust's (Osprey's)
approximately $2.4 billion senior secured notes due 2003 on
Rating Watch Negative. The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes
are currently rated `BBB'. This rating action follows the
placing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by
Fitch.

The rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund
account (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron
in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The
overfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated
'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to service
interest to noteholders. Payment of principal ultimately relies
on Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible
preferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred
securities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative. In addition, the
transaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loan
to Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch.

Similarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the
support from the assets in the share trust used to support
interest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to
remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund
principal payments. The mandatorily convertible preferred stock
has been issued and is being held in the share trust. The assets
in the share trust supporting interest payments include Enron
unsecured obligations (the overfund account) as well as
quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible
preferred stock.

While various sources of repayment exist, such as sale or
liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering, in
each case primary credit support is derived from the Enron
obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock
if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been
deposited with the trustee the 120-day prior to the maturity
date, which is one of the Note Trigger Events. In the event that
the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount
required to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to
deliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver
on this obligation, subject to certain standstill periods, then
the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of
Enron, representing a general unsecured claim. Additional Note
Trigger Events include a downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured
debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies
in conjunction with specified declines in Enron's closing stock
price over three consecutive trading days, as well as customary
events of default under the notes. It is important to note that
Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

Fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction
with the ratings of Enron, Corp. and will update investors as
appropriate.


Enron's Debt Falls As Company Draws Down On Bank Loans

10/26/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early Friday following the Houston energy giant's decision Thursday to draw down about $3 billion on its bank loan facilities. 
Late Thursday, Enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community. Specifically, the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $1 billion.
Enron's 6.4% bonds which come due in July 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar, down from around 82 cents on Thursday. 
Trading activity in investment-grade bank debt like that of Enron's isn't as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment-grade ratings. But fixed-income sources noted some offers Friday for Enron's bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar, still well-above distressed levels. They add that banks may want to try to sell Enron's bank debt, which is now funded following the drawdown, but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago. 
That was well before Enron ran into its current market turmoil. Last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The company has said that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with Andrew S. Fastow, its former chief financial officer who was replaced on Wednesday. 
Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's senior unsecured debt at Baa1, though it's on review for a possible downgrade. Fitch Inc. and Standard & Poor's both rate the debt triple-B-plus. Fitch also has Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, while S&P changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. 
Enron's stock was trading at around $15.87, down 48 cents at around 12.20 p.m. EDT. 
Among the Enron bank debt that comes due in May 2002 is a $1.75 billion 364-day commercial paper backstop facility. The company also has a $1.25 billion revolving facility that's due in April 2005, according to Loan Pricing Corp. in New York. 
One distressed debt investor said some of the bank debt comes with a low coupon of around 55 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate. 
Banks, the investor said, ""are funding it and not getting paid for the risk at Libor plus 55, even though it comes due in May '02,"" the investor said. 
Another fixed-income official said that trading desks may start to kick the tires on Enron's bank debt, given the run of fallen angels, or investment-grade companies that have been downgraded to below investment-grade status, within the last year. Among such companies are Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) and Xerox Corp. (XRX) 
""As soon as banks have a piece of paper they never expected to be funded, it really changes their perception and some just want to get this stuff off their books,"" this person said. 
Some banks, though, may not be active seller of Enron's debt given that banks' business with big investment-grade companies is relationship-driven. 
""Banks are not very quick to pull out of a relationship like that,"" the fixed income official said.

Can you please develop a list of questions for Legislative members to ask in 
the Gas hearing?

I would give the soft ball questions to PG&E and SoCal Gas and focus on the 
CPUC as the problems.

Jim"
104,"There is 4 proposed decisions that came out today. The CPUC is set to vote =
on=20
them tomorrow.  Here is a quick overview:

1) Two decisions address how much money is collected for going forward=20
electric energy costs and how much of that is paid to CDWR. Average rates a=
re=20
to increase 3c/kWh.  Further the AB1x  1 c/kWh is to continue.   Thus, the=
=20
total increase, relative to rates in effect in year 2000,  is 4 c/kWh=20
($40/MWh). Lynch was very unclear how this rate would be implemented for=20
residential customers (a tiering proposal will be heard separately and take=
=20
30-45 days to implement).  One of these decisions addresses how to measure=
=20
past undercollections but as far as rate increases go, they are to cover on=
ly=20
going forward costs.
2) One decision addresses QF issues.  I have not seen the PD (It is expecte=
d=20
out shortly).  The Wood PD revises his revised PD of last week (yes, a=20
revised, revised PD) as follows:
a) Requires QFs to be paid on a going forward basis (as of 4/1/01). Utiliti=
es=20
to pay within 15 days upon presentation of an invoice.  No help for past du=
e=20
amounts, however.
b) Change the SRAC energy index from Topock to Malin.  Such a change will=
=20
lower the SRAC energy by =01&4 c/kWh=018.  This is a 15% to 25% hit to SRAC=
=20
relative to the status quo, which is based more or entirely on Topock.
c) Calls for workshops to further refine the gas basis for SRAC and address=
=20
other factors in the SRAC formula such as heat rates and O&M factors=20
d) Works with Section 390, as is, does not depend on a legislative change
i) Thus the reason why SRAC is based upon a border price index.
e) Overall cap (i.e. 7.9 c/kWh) is dropped.
The fourth decision addresses an investigation of the utility holding=20
companies.  Basically the CPUC is going after utility holding companies for=
=20
funds to reduce the past undercollections.

Further Notes taken by Sue Mara during the press conference:

Lynch and Wood Running the meeting

Lynch started out castigating FERC for the ""failure to act"", sellers for hi=
gh=20
prices forcing CA into this action.  Has some charts in the press package. =
=20
Talked about how wonderful the Govs proposals have been.  Said net short is=
=20
34%.  Sellers ""have us over a barrell"" for those sales.  Attorney Gen=20
continues investigation of the sellers. These are all for going forward cos=
ts=20
-- this doesn't address the ""$ for the hot dog, which is being taken care o=
f=20
in Sacramento.""  She said these proposals ensure reliability and allow=20
Treasurer to issue bonds.  Continues to castigate FERC throughout the call.=
=20
Wants new appointments to FERC from the states -- ""our cries have fallen on=
=20
deaf ears""

Lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow:

1.  Wood's proposal -- modified -- Order the IOUs to pay the QFs beginning=
=20
4/1 on a going forward basis only.  Modified existing formula in Section 39=
0=20
(Legislative change to this section did not pass yet).  Shifts the gas inde=
x=20
from Topoc (where Wood says the prices are being mnipulated) to Malin, wher=
e=20
prices have been more stable.

2. Sets the CA Procurement Adjustment -- Orders the IOUs to pay the DWR for=
=20
purchases.  At one point she said that the order would be for all power for=
=20
purchased by the state beginning Jan 19; at another point she said that the=
=20
payments are for going forward costs. ""It's time to pay the power bills for=
=20
California.""  CPA calculated based on the ""residual"" method, rather than th=
e=20
proportional method.  Payments to DWR made on the proportional method,=20
however.

3.  Lynch alternate setting a 3 cents/kWh increase in accordance with AB 1X=
.=20
(The ALJ decision said no rate increase.) Makes the 1 cent temp charge=20
permanent (didn't say if its additive with the 3 cents) Believe this covers=
=20
ALL needs on a going forward basis.  According to  ABX 1, small customers=
=20
with 130% over baseline get no increase, small customers with 200% increase=
,=20
get a 9 % increase -- the rest get socked, I guess.  Adopted TURN's=20
accounting proposal.  Will look at rate design in a future proceeding.  Tak=
es=20
IOUs 30-45 days to charge the rates; will conduct a rate design proceeding=
=20
during that time period (see # 5).

4. Orders an investigation into the Utility holding company structure to se=
e=20
if it is best for the public utilities.

A new proceeding was also identified.

5.  Lynch is issuing an Assigned Comissioner ruling proposing a new rate=20
structure. (I presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use) =
=20
Need information from DWR to calculate rates and DWR has not yet provided=
=20
it.  Described the need to have a record on this. As mentioned in #3 above =
--=20
would expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30- 45 days.

In one of the above orders, Lynch said that she orders the utililities to g=
o=20
after sellers using all legal means for the unjust and unreasonable prices.

I'm still listening.

The Homestretch
Trying to hit the oil button while it is hot, Texas Gov. George W. Bush plans 
to unveil an energy plan Friday.  Larry Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economics 
adviser, says it would focus on increasing domestic energy production, 
promoting conservation and coaxing more production out of oil-exporting 
nations.  A particular focus will be on streamlining the granting of  permits 
for construction of refineries, pipelines and power plants.  Mr. Bush says 
the Clinton-Gore administration has clogged the permitting process, helping 
produce shortfalls in supply of home-heating oil and electricity production."

What do people thin about beginning to quietly discuss with members of the 
California state house that the damages of the summer are not (or don't need 
to) being charged to end use customers.  The utilities are doing a really 
good job of wrapping themselves with little households.  In fact, TURN signed 
on to this pleading.

While San Diego customers are harmed, other consumers in California are just 
fine.  Utility shareholders are taking it on the chin.  We need to make sure 
that policymakers (especially FERC) recognize that in making any kind of

125,"Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will continue for 
years
(Published July 24, 2001) 
The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more 
intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee 
sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn 
over internal documents. 
Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has 
adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple 
investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high. And it has 
become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians. 
At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted 
criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. ""I would love 
to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a 
tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' "" Lockyer said. With 
less colorful language, Gov. Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based 
companies as price gougers -- even though Texas firms have been fairly minor 
suppliers to California. 
Some of it is just buzzword politics. Lockyer and Davis know that 
Californians dislike anything associated with Texas, and Lay has been one of 
President Bush's major political supporters. Enron, meanwhile, cites the 
rhetoric as evidence that Lockyer, Davis and legislative investigators are 
interested less in finding the truth than in seeking scapegoats. Enron also 
filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the Senate's subpoenas of trading 
data. 
Most other energy companies have complied with the demands, creating 
Sacramento repositories of the data under elaborate confidentiality 
agreements worked out with the special Senate committee headed by Sen. Joseph 
Dunn, D-Santa Ana. But Enron has refused, and on Saturday, Dunn submitted a 
report asking the Senate for ""an appropriate coercive sanction."" 
Does Enron have something to hide? Or does it sincerely believe that what's 
happening in California is political scapegoating? Are the companies' fears 
about the confidentiality of the data sought by the Senate justified? Would 
data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light? Would data 
be used by competitors? Or could the information find its way into the hands 
of class-action attorneys? 
Dunn, a prominent trial attorney himself, insists that confidentiality will 
be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative 
purposes. But Enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of 
turning over confidential information to politicians. Similar information was 
leaked -- without penalty -- in last year's investigation of former state 
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. And there are indications that 
private lawyers are working closely with investigators. 
Mike Aguirre, the San Diego attorney seeking a ""smoking gun"" to prove 
collusion among energy companies, supplied Dunn's committee with a few 
dissident Duke Energy workers who alleged, in highly publicized hearings, 
that the firm had manipulated production at its San Diego plant to create 
artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices. Duke then refuted 
the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the Independent 
System Operator, the controller of California's power grid, indicating that 
ISO had ordered the plant operational changes. 
Aguirre subsequently asked the governor's office to pressure the ISO -- now 
under Davis' direct control -- to release all of the Duke-related documents 
that would show, he says, that the firm actually manipulated the situation. 
Duke and other companies insist that the ISO-held documents are proprietary. 
Aguirre pleaded with one Davis adviser in an e-mail that ""we need your help 
in properly getting this information out."" But Aguirre, in an interview, said 
he had not yet obtained cooperation from Davis aides. 
The political and legal struggle to affix blame for California's energy woes 
will continue for months, perhaps years. The crisis will cost ratepayers at 
least $50 billion, and they'll want to know why as they make out their 
utility bill checks.

U.S. energy company Enron said it wants to sell its 65% stake in Dabhol Power to India's government for at least $1 billion. But India's junior power minister told deputies in Parliament, in a written reply to questions, that the government isn't considering any proposal to buy Enron's stake. Dabhol is caught in a bitter dispute with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its sole customer, over tariff levels and payment defaults. General Electric and Bechtel of the U.S. each hold 10% Dabhol stakes, while the MSEB owns a 15% stake. The $2.9 billion Dabhol plant is India's largest foreign direct investment.

DJ Enron: UK Teesside Plant May Be Offline For Several Weeks
2001-08-10 08:23 (New York)



  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Friday said its 1,875-megawatt Teesside
plant in northeast England may be offline for several weeks.
  Teesside, which suffered an explosion and fire Aug. 8 that killed three
employees, must remain offline during a Health and Safety Executive
investigation which ""may take several weeks to complete,"" Enron said in a
statement.
  ""The plant remains offline and no decision on future operations will take
place for several days,"" it added.
  Following an investigation, Enron will have to submit a safety case for
approval before any portion of the plant may be brought back online, the Health
and Safety Executive has said.
  The process may be complicated by the fact that there has been one previous
fatal incident at Teesside.

Electric storm: Mild summer and US slowdown stave off Californian crisis
Andrew Gumbel in Los Angeles

The Independent - London
FOREIGN

(Copyright 2001 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

NOTHING ABOUT California's electricity crisis is turning out as expected. 
This was supposed to be the summer of sky-high wholesale prices and non- stop rolling blackouts, but they haven't happened. In fact, if you were to take a tour of the Golden State now you would be hard pressed to notice there was a crisis at all: The lights are on, and everyone is still here.
That's mostly because of a fluke of nature: The weather has been uncannily mild and so demand for air-conditioning and refrigeration systems, in particular, has been significantly reduced. 
It also helps, in a perverse sort of way, that the economy has been slowing down, particularly the energy-guzzling hi-tech sector. Consumption fell by 11 per cent in June, even before a round of retail price increases kicked in on 1 July, and by 5 per cent in July. 
Contrary to dire predictions, wholesale prices have in fact been falling, 
That's not all that has gone against expectations. We heard California's governor, Gray Davis, and his supporters, accuse private energy generating suppliers of ""gouging"" prices; the worst of them, they said, were based in the president's home state of Texas. 
However, power-buying statistics published last month showed that Texas companies like Enron and Dynergy had, in fact, sold California only 10 per cent of its electricity since the beginning of the year - much less than the Canadians, say - and that the highest spot-rate prices of all had in fact been charged by California-based concerns. 
We were also told to expect a showdown between California and the federal government. Californians, went the common wisdom, were hapless victims of a failed deregulation that had left them at the mercy of ruthless generating companies; moreover, their appeals for help from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) were falling on deaf ears because the president and his advisors were all in the pocket of those self-same companies. 
This picture, too, has been complicated by recent events. Under heavy pressure, FERC has reluctantly agreed to impose reasonably effective price caps, not only on California but on all the western states. At the same time, California's public officials themselves have been shown to be in the pocket of energy companies. 
Two veterans of the Gore presidential campaign brought in by Governor Davis recently resigned because it turned out they were simultaneously working for Southern California Edison, one of the state's two giant power utilities. Five other advisors were dismissed because of their personal holdings in energy stocks, while a sixth quit of his own accord. A further eight are under investigation. 
The conflict of interest has reached Governor Davis' press spokesman, Steve Maviglio, who agreed last week to sell his $12,000 (pounds 8,450) stake in a California energy company, Calpine, that had been noticeably absent from his public criticisms of the ""price- gougers"". It has also reached the chairman of the California Energy Commission, Bill Keese, who has just agreed to sell more than $500,000 in energy holdings, some of them in companies that have come before him on regulatory matters. 
Given the confusion into which the politics of the crisis has descended, it is tempting to look at the lights burning, both on Hollywood Boulevard and the San Francisco hilltops, and conclude that there is nothing out of the ordinary. 
But the crisis is far from over. ""It's not over because none of the underlying causes have been addressed,"" says Mark Bernstein, an energy specialist with the Rand Corporation. 
As things stand, California's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), is in bank-ruptcy court, and the second-largest, Southern California Edison, is still scrambling around for ways to avoid the same fate. The state government has become the sole official buyer of energy, creating severe imbalances in the budget and effectively putting all non-essential public programmes on hold. (Total energy expenditure in California is expected to reach $70bn this year, compared with $7bn last year, with the state picking up much of the slack.) There are hopes the state could eventually withdraw from the wholesale market, but nobody yet knows how. 
There is a complicated court battle going on to secure rebates from the generating companies for over-charging. The rebates could go as high as $9bn, although it is not clear whether the recipients would be the utilities or the state. The rebates will almost certainly get sucked into PG&E's bankruptcy settlement, further complicating the issue. 
Meanwhile, the root causes of the crisis have hardly changed: an improperly deregulated market with too few power sources, too little transmission infrastructure, and a dearth of active players in a position to create a truly free market. If nothing changes, Dr Bernstein says, the shortages, uncontrolled price rises and rolling blackouts will simply be postponed until next summer - or whenever the next demand crunch hits. 
Much of the political debate has focussed on generating plants - whether local authorities have been too slow to build them, or too reluctant on environmental grounds. But the state of the transmission grid is arguably a bigger problem, not only in California where there is a north-south bottleneck in the San Joaquin Valley, but across the country. Last month, Las Vegas suffered a blackout because there was no way to funnel emergency power supplies there quickly enough. Since there is no direct north-south transmission line through Nevada, the power has to travel either through California (a no-go in the current situation) or through Utah, which was experiencing similarly high demand at the time. 
One can anticipate similar problems in New York state and New England, where the dense population makes it hard to build new transmission lines, or in Florida, which has just two electric line connections to the wider United States, both of which were operating at capacity during last winter's peak season. Given the state's continuing population growth, it wouldn't take more than a bit of freak weather or a power plant going down unexpectedly for the great electricity crisis to hit there as well. 
""You can build as many power plants as you like, but if you don't have the grid to transmit the electricity they won't do you any good,"" Dr Bernstein remarked. The White House energy plan recently unveiled focuses almost entirely on energy production; not on distribution or conservation. If implemented in its current form by Congress, it is unlikely - energy specialists say - to do much to alleviate the core US problem. 
California's respite this Summer could well be the calm before a much wider storm.

The power behind the Teeside plant where three died
Chris Blackhurst

08/10/2001
The Independent - London
FOREIGN
8
(Copyright 2001 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

UNTIL TUESDAY'S explosion that killed three people at its Teesside power station - the third died yesterday - the public profile in this country of the US energy company Enron was pretty low. 
The $100bn firm owns Wessex Water but lacks the consumer recognition of other high-profile energy operators such as Exxon, Shell and BP.
But, behind the scenes in high political circles, Enron is extremely well known. It is a company that gives the appearance of securing what it wants - either here, such as when the Labour Government came to office vowing not to allow any more new private gas-fired power stations, only to relent in Enron's case on Teesside, or in the US, where the firm is the best connected of any to the new President, George Bush. Or even in India, where, despite enormous public hostility, it was the driving force behind plans for a massive power station that was built at Dabhol, near Bombay. 
In India, Amnesty International compiled a report on the tactics used by the local contractors building the power station to get their own way. It makes for graphic reading: Sugandha Vasudev Bhalekar was in her bathroom at five in the morning when several male police officers entered her house and started beating sleeping members of her family. Mrs Bhalekar, 24, and pregnant, was then dragged from the house into the road and struck on the back with police batons. She said: ""My one-and-a-half-year-old daughter desperately held on to me but the police kicked her away."" 
She was targeted by the police because her husband, Baba, was a leader of those who were protesting against the building of the plant. 
Villagers complained they would be overcharged for their electricity, while there were allegations of corruption involving state officials. Local people were also displaced and concerns were raised about environmental damage. 
Local constructors paid the state government for the hire of reserve police to protect the site but, in a damning study, Amnesty found the police engaged in a systematic campaign of mass arrests and unprovoked assaults. Amnesty called on the US companies building the plant to safeguard human rights and to establish guidelines for all security personnel at the site. 
Amnesty's report - the only one ever produced by the organisation into a commercial project, as opposed to a government - was published in July 1997. The main US company, with an 80 per cent share in the Dabhol plant, was Enron. 
Yet in Britain, little more than a year later at the 1998 Labour conference, Enron was able to pay pounds 15,000 to sponsor the party's gala dinner. In all, Enron has given pounds 27,500 to Labour's cause. 
When Labour came to power in 1997, there was little prospect, seemingly, of the company's hoped-for Teesside plant going ahead. The Tories had pursued a ""dash for gas"" policy; Labour, out of a residual support for Britain's coal industry, voiced its opposition. But, within two years, Enron received a special exemption to build at Teesside. By November last year, Labour was right behind the ""dash for gas"". Stephen Byers, the Trade Secretary at the time, lifted the ban completely, thereby consenting to another Enron project on the Isle of Grain in Kent. 
In the world of energy and political lobbying, Enron is king. Simon McRae, of Friends of the Earth, said: ""When you look at their influence in Government- policy making, in areas like climate change, they know how to throw their weight around."" 
Determined to succeed in Britain, the firm hired the political lobbying organisation, GJW. One of GJW's employees subsequently boasted to an undercover journalist how he would ensure Enron would overcome the Government ban on private gas-fired stations. ""The way you go about it is that you play on the existing prejudices within the Cabinet for coal, you play on the existing prejudices within the Cabinet for competition, and you play the forces off against each other. It's intimate knowledge of what's going on that produces results in the end."" 
The lobbyist did well and Enron got its power stations. The company continues to wield influence. This year, it was one of a select group of businesses to accompany Nick Raynsford, the government minister, on a trade mission to Egypt. Ralph Hodge, Enron's European head, has been awarded a CBE for ""services to the power generation and gas industries."" 
Relatively obscure here it may be, but Enron touches us all our lives. In the US, the company was the biggest backer of George Bush. Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, is widely supposed to be one of the new president's energy advisers. Mr Bush is under pressure to reveal the identities of his behind- the-scenes team and it would be a shock if Mr Lay is not one of them: his company even vetted applicants for jobs on the commission regulating the US energy market. The Enron chairman is thought to have also played a key role in the shock decision by Mr Bush to drop the Kyoto global warming accord and to persuade him to open up the hitherto protected Alaskan arctic wilderness to energy exploration.

THIRD MAN DIES AFTER EXPLOSION

(Copyright 2001)

A THIRD man caught in a power station blast died yesterday as it was revealed the plant operator has twice been fined for safety breaches. 
A fourth victim of Wednesday's explosion at Teesside Power Station is in a stable condition in hospital with burns.
US company Enron moved into the UK in 1989. But during construction of the pounds 850million plant in 1992, a worker died after being run down on the site. The company were fined pounds 17,000, said the Health and Safety Executive. 
The second prosecution in 1998 came after a worker was horrifically burned and left unable to work following an blast at the plant two years earlier. Enron were fined pounds 10,000. 
But a spokesman for the firm insisted yesterday: ""Safety is paramount in all Enron operations and the company strives to prevent all incidents. 
""In 2001, the plant was given the Rospa Gold Award for safety. 
""Until yesterday, throughout the eight years of operation there had been only one serious incident, in 1996 when an employee was injured in an explosion. 
""The cause was traced to a fuel feed pipe joint which had not been tightened after maintenance by the contractor Westinghouse."" 
Enron's chief executive officer, Jeff Skilling, travelled to Teesside from the firm's HQ in Houston, Texas. 
After seeing the accident site, Skilling said: ""We pledge to work with the authorities to ensure it never happens again anywhere."" 
The plant, which employs 100 people and generates electricity for the National Grid using North Sea gas, remains closed. 
A joint police and health and safety investigation has been launched into the explosion in an electrical transformer which led to an oil fire.

UK: TEXT-S&P says Teesside Power plant shutdown no economic impact.

08/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(The following statement was released by the ratings agency. 
LONDON, Aug 10 - Following a fatal explosion at Teesside Power Ltd.'s 1,875 MW generating plant on Aug. 8, 2001, Standard & Poor's said today that it does not expect the resultant plant shutdown will have a material impact on the plant's economics, if it is able to restart quickly.
It is too early to determine whether the shutdown will have a long-term economic effect on the noteholders at Teesside Power Financing Ltd. (TPFL). The servicing of TPFL's debt notes (BB/Stable) is dependent on adequate dividends paid by the operating company, Teesside Power Ltd., to TPFL. 
It is understood that Teesside's short-term power-supply obligations have already been hedged, protecting the plant from high balancing charges under the new electricity trading arrangements introduced in March 2001. The ultimate sponsor and operator of the plant, Enron Corp . (BBB+/Stable/A-2), has not yet determined the extent of the damage. Restarting the plant will be subject to the approval of the relevant safety authorities.

AUSTRALIA: Pacific Hydro seeks 75MW wind farm approval.

08/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

MELBOURNE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Power generator Pacific Hydro Ltd said on Friday it had lodged planning applications for a 75 megawatt wind farm at Buangor in western Victoria, but the project hinged on development of local turbine manufacturing. 
The company last month opened the 18.3 MW Codrington wind farm on Victoria's west coast. Its proposed 150 MW to 200 MW Portland Wind Energy Project is awaiting environmental approval.
Pacific Hydro said it had invited tenders from four wind turbine companies to begin Australian manufacturing if its Portland proposal cleared the approvals process. 
""Since we started building the Codrington wind farm the Australian dollar devalued about 15 percent so the economics of importing has changed,"" Pacific Hydro managing director Jeff Harding told Reuters. 
""Our Portland project presents a project of sufficient size to justify local manufacturing."" 
Companies short-listed to set up Australian wind turbine manufacturing are Enron Corp , Vestas Wind Systems , NEG Micon and Bonus. 
Harding said it was hoped the Portland project would clear government regulatory approvals by early next year. 
""We hope to have construction start on the Portland wind farm project by the middle of next year,"" he said. 
Clearance of the Portland project would pave the way for the company to move ahead with the Challicum Hills Wind Farm project at Buangor. 
Harding said the company had lodged a town planning application with the Ararat Council and it was hoped the project could begin in 2003. 
A number of companies are looking at building wind farms, particularly in Australia's southern states, partly due to Federal government legislation requiring retailers to increase their use of renewable electricity. 
Pacific Hydro shares ended down nine cents at A$3.99 on Friday while the broader market was down 0.45 percent.

MADRID (AFX) - Compania Espanola de Petroleos SA, Endesa SA are among a group of companies which will today present bids for 25 pct of Gas Natural SDG SA's supply contract with Algeria, El Pais reported, citing the Economy Ministry. 
The ministry has not released details of the potential bidders, the newspaper said, but noted that the four leading Spanish electricity utilities and BP Amoco PLC are known to be participating in the auction.
It said Enron Corp is also thought to be interested in the contract which is currently held by Gas Natural unit Enagas SA. 
Last July, the government announced plans to auction part of the contract to other companies operating in Spain's energy sector. 
The interested parties must present a business plan for the gas sector for the period 2000-2005, and will also have to provide the sector with an amount of natural gas similar to or greater than that awarded in the contract. 
Neither Gas Natural nor Repsol YPF SA, which owns 45 pct of the gas company, are permitted to participate in the auction.

NEW DELHI, Aug 10 Asia Pulse - The Indian Power Minister, Suresh Prabhu, has briefed the Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, on the power scenario in the country, including developments on the private sector projects. 
The ongoing payment dispute between US energy giant Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company and its sole buyer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and another US company AES threatening to pull out of Orissa power distribution are believed to have come up for discussion during the detailed presentation made by Prabhu yesterday evening.
Both Enron and AES are wanting to walk out of the power sector over payment defaults by state utilities. 
Yesterday's meeting was attended by the Finance Minister, Yashwant Singh, the Planning Commission, an economic thinktank, Deputy Chairman, K C Pant, the junior Minister for Planning & Programme Implementation, Arun Shourie, the junior Minister for coal, Shahnawaz Hussain, and the junior Minister for Power, Jayawanti Mehta. 
The presentation outlined the major issues in power sector including declining trend of capacity addition and presisting shortages, poor financial health of state power utilities, transmission constraints and poor state of rural electrification, an official statement said here. 
Outlining the action proposed by Ministry of Power, Prabhu told Prime Minister that to arrest the declining trend in capacity addition, central utilities are targetting an addition of 43 per cent of required MW capacity as against 23 per cent in the 9th Plan.

INDIA'S DABHOL RECEIVES CUSTOMS DUTY NOTICE FOR LNG TERMINAL

(c) Copyright 2001 Asia Pulse PTE Ltd.

NEW DELHI, Aug 10 Asia Pulse - Customs authorities have issued a show-cause notice to Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on valuation and rate of duties for goods imported by the company for its LNG terminal. 
""Dabhol Power Company received communication on August 3, 2001 from Customs authorities which relates to on-going discussions between the parties on the issues of valuation of imported goods and the rate of duty applicable for aspects of the project,"" a DPC spokespersons told PTI from Mumbai.
Customs Department is believed to have slapped about Rs three billion duty demand on DPC for its imports relating to the liquefid natural gas (LNG) terminal for the second phase of the $2.9 billion power project. 
Asked about the quantum of duty involved in the customs communication, the spokesperson said ""we are evaluating it."" 
He said ""while it is quite routine for a project of this size to discuss these kind of issues with customs authorities, we are examining the queries raised therein, and shall be reverting with the due response."" 
Enron is setting up a 5 million tonnes (expandable to 10 million tonnes) capacity LNG import and regassification terminal at Dabhol, of which only 2 million tonnes would be used as feed stock in the power plant while the remaining being marketed. 
Customs department is understood to have raised objection on the premise that since surplus gas would be supplied to other industrial users and therefore the facility is not project specific and so does ot entitle concessional duty, sources said.

Enron willing to sell Dahbol stake to India
by Claire Poole

The Daily Deal
Copyright (c) 2001 The Deal LLC

The Houston energy giant is finally willing to sell its 65% stake in the troubled power company to the Indian government in exchange for the money it invested in the project. 
After weeks of rumors, innuendo and scattershot comments by executives, Houston energy giant Enron Corp. finally made it official Aug.9: The company is willing to sell its 65% stake in the troubled Dabhol Power Co. to the Indian government in exchange for the money it had invested in the project.
""In the interest of quickly resolving this dispute, Enron has expressed a willingness to forgo expected profits and negotiate terms that would allow the Indian authorities to acquire the foreign stakeholders' interests in DPC,"" Enron said in a written statement. 
Enron insisted, however, that it and co investors General Electric Co. and Bechtel, which each own 10%, recoup all that they had invested in the $2.9 billion project. 
""Enron and its partners would still need to recover 100% of their costs,"" the statement continued. ""The company is willing to take this step and forgo significant profits on its investment if the dispute can be resolved amicably with full recovery of our costs in the near term."" 
Press reports have pegged Enron's investment at $1 billion. Enron spokesman Johan Zaayman wouldn't disclose how much Enron and its partners had invested in the $2.9 billion project. 
""We are seeking to sell the equity we've invested in the project, but we're not talking about any specific amounts yet,"" he said. ""It's too early."" 
John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston, figures Enron has invested about $875 million in equity in the facility. 
""I call them 'innocents abroad,'"" he said. ""They didn't know boo about what they were getting into. In India, you can't win, you can't get even and you can't even get out of the game."" 
Enron and Dabhol's primary customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which owns 15% of the project, have been locked in a bitter dispute since April over investment, payment and pricing issues. 
Enron has charged MSEB with failing to invest in the project's second phase and defaulting on $45 million in electricity payments. 
MSEB countered that Dabhol's electricity prices were too high. It stopped buying power from the facility in May. 
Enron's sale of its stake in the project would be a big blow to India. It is India's biggest foreign investment to date, and Enron's departure could scare away other companies from investing in the country. 
Arlington, Va., power plant developer AES Corp. is also threatening to leave the country. 
Last month, it said it would sell its 51% stake in electric distribution company Cesco unless the state government allowed it to raise tariffs and gave it a better regulatory environment. 
On Thursday, AES told state transmission company Gridco to stop supplying power because it has no money to pay it or even salaries for its 8,500 workers.

India: Dabhol Power goes to PM with equity sale offer

08/10/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd

NEW DELHI, Aug. 9. AFTER failing to elicit the support of both the Power and Finance Ministries for a buyout of its troubled project by Central utilities, the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has approached the Prime Minister, Mr A.B. Vajpayee, with a similar proposal, according to top sources. 
In a letter to the Prime Minister, DPC has offered to sell its equity in the project to the Government for $1 billion on a no-profit no-loss basis.
Interestingly, when contacted, DPC chief, Mr Wade Cline, told Business Line that 'a private letter' to this effect had been recently sent to ""the Power and Finance Ministry representatives."" Mr Kline clarified that so far no company has approached them for buying out their stake in DPC. 
The Union Power Minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu, however, maintained that the Power Ministry had not received any such communication. The Power and Finance Ministries have been of the view that their role in resolving the issue would be restricted to finding buyers for phase II of the power project which has a capacity of 1,415 MW. 
Even as DPC has knocked at the doors of the PMO, the lenders to the project are at present talking to the stakeholders - MSEB, DPC and the Centre- for reducing the tariff so as to find buyers for the power from the second phase. 
Informally, the Centre has been consulted on the possible revenue losses if the duty on the LNG terminal is waived. This is likely to be of the order of around Rs 300 crore. The other variable is the transmission charges for transfer of power to the neighbouring purchasing states. 
As per the counter-guarantee agreement between the Centre, State and the DPC, which alone binds the Centre contractually, the Centre's liability is restricted to payment of outstanding energy bills of DPC (for past power sale to Maharashtra State Electricity Board) and payment of foreign debt up to $300 million. 
The sequence of events leading up to the DPC communique to the Prime Minister are worth recalling. 
Sometime in March this year, the company had informally sent a proposal to the Government to sell its equity in the project for $1 billion. 
The report published in this paper was, however, denied. 
On June 9 this year, when Enron worldwide chief, Mr Kenneth Lay, met with the Power Minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu, his proposal to the Centre to buyout the project was again shot down. Further, the Enron chief's request to meet with the Prime Minister did not fructify. 
Now, nearly two months later, the company has sent a proposal directly to the Prime Minister, seeking his intervention for the Centre to buyout the project for $1 billion. 
In Parliament, meanwhile, the Union Minister of State for Power, Ms Jayawantiben Mehta, stated that the Government does not propose to buy out the DPC's equity-holding in the project.

India's Prabhu on Enron's Offer to Sell India Project: Comment
2001-08-09 22:13 (New York)


     Mumbai, Aug. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Indian Power Minister Suresh
Prabhu speaks on Enron Corp.'s offer to the government to buy out
its $3 billion power project in the country at cost.
     Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power Co, which runs the $3
billion power plant, India's biggest foreign investment. General
Electric Capital and the closely held Bechtel group together own
20 percent of the company.

     ``There's no point in making an offer to the government. Was
it (the offer) a part of the contract?'' between Dabhol and the
state board. ``A seller has to find a buyer.''
     Still, the government will help resolve the seven-month old
payment dispute, Prabhu said.
     ``We will facilitate an early solution to the problem, and to
the mutual satisfaction of the parties concerned. We are not
washing our hands off it.
     ``We have taken number of steps towards reduction of tariff.
I can't give you an absolute number right now as it depends on
variables like fuel costs, capacity utilization. Even lenders have
agreed to lower rates. We are working on the number.''

     Enron wants to exit the venture, as it is owed $64 million by
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only customer, in
unpaid bills. The board in May stopped buying power, saying it's
too expensive.
     Enron said it has invested $875 million in the project. The
plant can generate 740 megawatts of power and Dabhol had planned
to add another 2,184 megawatts of capacity this year.

Figures show state lost big on extra power 
Posted at 9:53 p.m. PDT Monday, July 23, 2001 
BY JOHN WOOLFOLK 
Mercury News 
State figures show California may have lost about $14 million this month selling surplus electricity for less than it cost. 
The Mercury News disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a loss. But the new figures provide the first indication of just how much excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts -- and how cheaply some of that power was sold when it turned out not to be needed. 
A Republican lawmaker said Monday the loss also shows Democratic Gov. Gray Davis' energy policies are needlessly costing consumers. 
``This whole thing is a mess,'' said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, who requested details of the state's surplus power sales. ``The government needs to get out of the power business before it costs Californians even more money.'' 
A state spokesman didn't dispute the $14 million figure outright but said it is an approximation based on average prices and that the actual loss probably is less. 
``It's a number I'm sure he likes very much, but it's definitely an estimated number, and it could be far lower,'' said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources. 
Campbell responded that the loss also could be higher. 
The state has spent $415 million on power so far this month. 
State officials last week confirmed that cool weather and consumer conservation have left California holding more power than it needs. The revelation was a stunning turnaround for a state that months ago was paying top dollar for power, expecting shortages this summer. 
Price that was paid 
The state bought 3.5 million megawatt-hours of electricity for July at an average price of $118 per megawatt-hour, according to a response Friday by the Department of Water Resources to Campbell's inquiry. The state has sold 178,000 surplus megawatt-hours in July at an average price of $37, the department said. 
Based on those average prices, the state paid $21 million for the surplus power, which it sold for $6.5 million -- $14.5 million less than it cost. 
A more precise calculation of the state's loss is difficult because purchased power is acquired at different times and prices and pooled as a ``portfolio.'' 
Purchases included long-term contracts that averaged $138 per megawatt-hour as well as cheaper spot-market buys. 
State officials last week said they were selling surplus at $15 to $30 a megawatt-hour, while some traders cited unconfirmed sales as low as $1. 
Hidalgo noted that the surplus sales represent just 5 percent of California's July purchases, which totaled $415 million. The $6.5 million from sales will help lower the state's power bill, he said, adding that utilities routinely sell some extra electricity. 
``Despite the fact that we're in somewhat of a surplus, any power-buying operation in the world is going to have to plan for these types of situations,'' Hidalgo said. ``It's not unique, and in fact it's normal operating procedure for any utility.'' 
Other Western utilities, including Portland General Electric in Oregon, have said they, too, are selling some surplus power at a loss and describe it as a cost of doing business. 
The suppliers buying the state's surplus electricity on the cheap include the big out-of-state energy companies that the governor has called price-gouging ``snakes.'' Among them are Duke Energy, Dynegy Power and Marketing, El Paso Power Services, Mirant, Reliant Energy and Williams Energy. 
`Best bid' taken 
Hidalgo said the state took the best offers it could find. 
``It's only reasonable to get the best bid you can,'' he said. 
Campbell said the $14 million loss is troubling because ratepayers or taxpayers will have to cover the cost, whereas a private utility could be forced to eat the expense if regulators determined it was unreasonable. 
State officials say what's more important is that the overall cost of power is dropping, from an average daily tab of $64 million in May to $25 million this month, in part because the state has so much power.

Jeff is pretty full up with the CA legislature and all the electric stuff.  We can try him, tho.  What I would like is to come up with a coherent message on hedging in CA, particularly the core-non-core issues, so that at the end of the day, EES still has a market and ENA can sell hedges to the LDCs.  Sue Landwehr in Gov Affairs is the leader/coordinator of our hedging activities before the state commissions and we should get her involved as well.  In fact I will cc both Sue and Jeff on this.

Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals 
A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourse-rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates. 
Mary Kay Miller, vice president of rates and certificates, acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes (prior to posting its available capacity) with two shippers -- Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd. -- that subsequently entered into negotiated-rate transactions. But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered ""moot"" by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted. 
""Even if they would have sent...a fax the day before"" capacity became available, ""it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted"" at that time, said Miller. Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan. 31, the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern, were ""null and void."" The only ""relevant"" ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan. 31, she noted. 
Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwestern's methods for notifying customers about available capacity, the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre-posting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson. 
It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated-rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's maximum allowed rate of 38 cents/MMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border. The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated-rate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total 45,000 MMBtu/d of service on Transwestern during February and March. 
Richardson and Sempra ""clearly did not have any 'deal' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted,"" Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony. The two companies ""had the right to the capacity only 'after' they submitted their bids, 'after' the posting period ended, 'after' Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted, and 'after' a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern, Richardson or Sempra,"" she noted. 
Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E. Sullivan to the contrary, ""Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates,"" Miller testified. 
Sullivan, an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates' (OMTR) Division of Litigation, contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates (see Daily GPI, Aug. 29 <http://www.intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010829e.html>). In fact, he believes the pre-posting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate, so that shippers might be more ""willing to enter into negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate, in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [it became] available."" But Miller counters that Sullivan ""offers not support for his claim."" 
She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson, in response to a data request by Southern California Edison, support Transwestern's claims. Both companies replied ""no"" when asked whether ""any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate."" 
The ""capacity at issue was offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate; there was no prohibition, restrictions, limitation, condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate; and any potential shipper, including Richardson or Sempra, could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate."" 
Sullivan contends that Transwestern's motive for allegedly advancing negotiated-rate transactions at the expense of recourse-rate deals was pure profit. Under questioning by Thomas J. Burgess of FERC's OMTR, Miller conceded that Transwestern earned $1.8 million from Sempra Energy's contract in March, $1.3 million from Richardson's March contract, and a ""comparable"" amount from Richardson's February contract. She noted the pipeline received a ""substantially higher"" amount as a result of Sempra's February contract, but she didn't provide an exact figure. FERC's Sullivan estimated the pipeline's profit from the Sempra February contract was more than $5 million. 
Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwestern's coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates. But Miller countered that the Commission's negotiated-rate policy ""does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits."" 
Furthermore, she said the Transwestern case shouldn't be used to consider changes to the negotiated-rate policy, as Sullivan has suggested. This case ""is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated-rate policy should only be done on an industry-wide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged."" "
144,"Jeff,

Wasn't sure who ""survived"" in California, glad to hear you're still on board.  Given the Enron situation, what can you tell me about coverage in California?  Will you and/or any other Enron level employees cover the CPUC and legislative proceedings?  If appropriate, should Transwestern consider contracting a lobbyist, if yes, any recommendations?  We no longer have Mark Baldwin under contract due a conflict of interest.  With the new legislative session coming up after the first of the year, I just want to be prepared for what we need to do.  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

INDIA PRESS: Dabhol Challenges Commission's Jurisdiction

07/19/2001
Dow Jones Asian Equities Report 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Dabhol Power Co. Wednesday appealed to the Supreme 
Court to challenge the jurisdiction of Maharashtra State Electricity 
Regulatory Commission, reports the Business Standard. 
Dabhol, the Indian unit of U.S. energy major Enron Corp. (ENE), is 
challenging the Commission's decisions on Dabhol's disputes with its sole 
buyer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.
The newspaper report quoted a Dabhol spokesman as saying the issue will come 
up for a hearing in several days. 
Dabhol's global lenders have also decided to appeal to the Supreme Court 
within a week over the same issue, the report added. 
Dabhol is the single largest foreign investment in India, worth $2.9 billion. 
Its power plant in the western Indian state of Maharashtra has a capacity to 
generate 740 megawatts. The plant has stopped operations since May 29 after 
MSEB stopped drawing power from Dabhol saying its tariffs were 
""unaffordable.""

I know you're out of town today. Wonder if you can give me a quick

                                       year's political campaigns. So who 
stands to benefit?

                                       - - - - - - - - - - - -
                                       By Katharine Mieszkowski

                                       Nov. 7, 2000 | As the 2000 campaign 
season winds up, quite
                                       a few major corporations have lighter 
pockets; the same year
                                       that saw campaign finance reform 
become a significant election
                                       issue also witnessed leading 
candidates raking in more
                                       corporate dollars than ever before. 

                                       The Center for Responsive Politics 
estimates that by the time
                                       the last ""soft-money"" dollar has been 
counted, the amount
                                       contributed will be the greatest haul 
of its kind in the history of
                                       U.S. politics -- $3 billion for the 
federal elections alone. By the
                                       center's estimates 50 percent more 
dough has been contributed
                                       to campaigns this year than in the 
last presidential campaign
                                       season. We have companies like AT&T, 
Microsoft, Citigroup
                                       and Verizon Communications to thank 
for underwriting the
                                       blizzard of campaign propaganda. 

                                       The surging economy isn't the only 
reason
                                       that contributions are up. Since both 
the
                                       presidential race and control of the 
House
                                       are up in the air, many companies are 
betting
                                       that the wisest strategy is to 
prudently fund
                                       both sides of the aisle. 

                                       ""There are no safe bets this year,"" 
says Larry
                                       Makinson, executive director of the 
center.
                                       ""They've got to protect themselves by 
giving
                                       to both sides, and they're being shaken
                                       down mercilessly by fundraisers."" 

                                       Not surprisingly, many of the biggest
                                       contributors are in highly regulated 
industries
                                       like telecommunications and finance. 

                                       Based on the latest available data 
from the Federal Election
                                       Commission, AT&T is the biggest single 
contributor to this
                                       year's election. As of Oct. 1, the 
telecommunications company
                                       -- a perennial major donor -- had 
given more than $4.3 million,
                                       with 62 percent of that money going to 
Republicans. AT&T
                                       has been lobbying Congress to change 
federal regulations that
                                       will force the telecommunications 
giant to sell some of its cable
                                       holdings. Verizon Communications and 
SBC Communications,
                                       two contenders for AT&T's telecom 
throne, are the fourth and
                                       seventh biggest donors, respectively. 

                                       Mergers are a huge reason for 
companies to give, give and give
                                       some more to members of the House and 
Senate. ""You don't
                                       want any embarrassing hearing being 
called in Congress if
                                       you're trying to acquire a big 
company,"" says Makinson. While
                                       in the '70s many of today's brand of 
megamergers would have
                                       had members of Congress ""pounding 
their fists,"" today's larger
                                       mergers are sailing by without so much 
as a peep. 

                                       Microsoft, still trying to recover 
from its antitrust hangover, is
                                       the second largest corporate donor -- 
having given more than
                                       $3.4 million at last count. Bill Gates 
and Co. seem to have
                                       learned their lesson from years of 
neglecting to remember
                                       political friends at election time. ""I 
joke that what Microsoft is
                                       really after is legislation that makes 
it legal to give direct
                                       contributions to federal judges,"" says 
Makinson. The company
                                       has given almost evenly to Republican 
and Democratic forces
                                       this year. 

                                       Notably, many large unions, like the 
American Federation of
                                       State, County and Municipal Employees, 
the AFL-CIO and
                                       the Service Employees International 
Union, gave as much as
                                       the top corporate donors. But if 
business contributions and
                                       union contributions are taken in 
aggregate, the for-profit guys
                                       outspent the unions 15 to 1. Also, 
many of the top individual
                                       contributors are corporate CEOs who 
give their own money to
                                       a candidate in addition to what their 
corporation might donate.
                                       For example, Enron, a Texas energy 
company, is the 13th
                             biggest corporate donor, and the biggest single 
donor, to
                             George W. Bush over the course of his short 
political career.
                             Kenneth Lay, CEO of Enron, had at last count 
also contributed
                             more than $300,000 of his own money -- almost 
exclusively to
                             Republican causes -- this year. 

                                       The moral of the story seems to be: 
Give, or take your
                                       chances. For many companies, opening 
up their ample wallets
                                       is undoubtedly intended not just for 
political favors but as a
                                       defense mechanism in case they should 
face some public
                                       relations debacle that congressional 
hearings wouldn't help.
                                       ""That probably was Firestone's big 
problem,"" says Makinson.
                                       ""They don't give enough campaign 
contributions. They give
                                       virtually nothing.""

Dabhol lenders to vote today on PPA PPPPA termination
Our Banking Bureau Mumbai

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The 25-odd lenders to the Dabhol power project will vote today on whether the 
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) should be allowed to to serve a 
preliminary PPA termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB). The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing 
the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian 
lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of 
India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they 
will not be able to block the move.
Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in 
favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 
25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone 
conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. 
Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not 
participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries 
including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and 
OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. ""In the first round, Indian lenders put 
their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. 
Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian 
lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign 
lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice,"" said a source. The 
Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and 
cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore 
worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is 
complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the 
Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K 
Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a 
meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen 
that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal 
to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The 
domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is 
terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.

SAO PAULO (AFX) - Enron Corp will suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the 
Brazilian energy sector, news agency JB Online quoted Enron vice-president 
and Eletricidade e Servicos SA Elektro chairman Orlando Gonzales as saying. 
Of the total investment, 500 mln usd was to be assigned to the expansion of 
the thermoelectric plant Cuiaba II in the state of Mato Grosso, and in the 
construction of Rogen in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with the remainder to 
be invested in unit Elektro, it said.
""There are no clear regulations for the sector. Regulatory issues are holding 
back investments,"" JB Online quoted Gonzales as saying. 
Gonzales said the decision to suspend the investments may be reconsidered if 
the energy sector regulator Aneel establishes clearer regulations.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a 
statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or 
about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to 
meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. 
Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , 
proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.
Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its 
transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. 
In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it 
would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that 
will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. 
The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or 
enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement 
said. 
SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in 
central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate 
transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to 
over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. 
The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas 
pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump 
because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for 
construction. 
Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. 
And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern 
River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave 
Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, 
Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.
At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that ""industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia."" 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX

05/15/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made 
with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), 
whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading 
system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas 
Price Indices. 
NGX acquired the AECO ""C"" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot 
gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. 
last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the 
establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions 
conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues 
to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.
Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, ""We believe that inclusion of data 
from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North 
America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and 
integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which 
removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after 
reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we 
recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that 
""more is better"". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline 
system should improve the quality of our price indices even further."" 
Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, ""We are very 
pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive 
source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price 
indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline 
will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices."" 
The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by 
Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and 
Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action 
against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. 
NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by 
August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to 
the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant 
contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The 
methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be 
on a weighted-average basis. 
NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index 
Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com. 
NGX located in Calgary, Canada provides electronic trading and clearing 
services to natural gas buyers and sellers at seven markets in Canada. Over 
the past six years, NGX has grown to serve over 120 customers with trading 
activity averaging 225,000 TJ's per month. NGX is owned 100% by OM

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 
billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the 
U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a 
United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. 
Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the 
project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.
Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans 
to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore 
North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. 
Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while 
UOG owns the remaining 51%. 
Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas 
transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government 
would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. 
However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put 
up the money itself. 
Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay 
significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will
operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing
natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are 
scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 
2005. 

Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners 
haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on 
the price of the pipeline. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an 
initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full 
agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.

Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit 
NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. 
The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. 
""What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed,"" Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. 
The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. 
""There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work,"" Angelides said. 
Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. 
Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, ""are not ready to act."" 
Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. 
How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. 
Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. 
In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. 
The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. 
Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. 
Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. 
Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said. "

193,"Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 
This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 
In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 
Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 
But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 
As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 
Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 
Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 
Duress alleged
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 
""We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,"" said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. ""We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal."" 
Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 
""The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,"" Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 
""Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,"" Shames said. 
Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 
He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
""To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,"" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. ""There were other means to manage the emergency."" 
The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
""First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.
Willingness to deal
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 
The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are ""just and reasonable."" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 
Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 
For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
""In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ""We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone."" 
Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 
Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
""The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,"" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 
The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 
Sempra says contract fair
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 
San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 
Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 
""It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' "" Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 
White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
""There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,"" White said. ""The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 
""But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"" 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 
Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 
The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 
Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 
""We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 
A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 
In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 
Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. ""The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 
Said Freeman: ""We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks."" 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 
Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 
The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called ""peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 
The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 
""I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 
Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 
Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 
Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 
""I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 
The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 
The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
""It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
""The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. ""Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

196,"Mike Day and I talked.  Mike agreed that there's ""elbow room"" in PUC regulations that would allow PG&E to do the financial swap we talked about late yesterday without having to get regulatory approval.  However, Mike also agreed that there's some risk (moderate to low in our view) that the PUC could try to ding the utility--for whatever reason--next time it goes under review as part of its general rate case.  In the end, PG&E will have to decide whether doing the financial with us is--in PG&E's view--overly aggressive or not from a regulatory perspective.  In short, doesn't seem to be any real downside in raising it and seeing how PG&E responds.  If this doesn't answer the question sufficiently, let me know.

204,"Chris:
A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday):
A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.
After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) 
We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.  
In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution.
We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.)
For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs.
We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC. 

With respect to what else we could offer them:
From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge.
One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.  Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.)
Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective.
One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.  
This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.
The ""note"" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Jeff

214,"Madam Chairwoman,

My name is Gary Ackerman, and I am the Executive Director of the Western
Power Trading Forum.  My forum is a California trade association whose
29 members are buyers, sellers, and exchanges of wholesale and retail
electric power.

We are here today to support the elements of the Community Choice
model.  A workably competitive market is one that has many buyers and
sellers.  Today we have a market with many sellers, but few buyers.  The
Community Choice model provides for many buyers of power, unlike the
present situation where the market is dominated by three; PG&E, SCE, and
SDG&E.  These three buyers represent about 87% of the load in the
restructured electricity market, the balance of which is provided by a
handful of competitive Energy Service Providers.

Community Choice will allow city governments to procure on behalf of
their constituents energy which meets their local energy needs.
Long-term contracts for energy and energy services will be written with
credit-worthy suppliers such as Enron, APS Energy Services, Newwest
Energy, and Green Mountain dot com who will compete to win the business.
""Demand responsiveness"" will be created through the innovation that
these sellers will utilize in order to win new business. Cities will be
able to cooperate with bidders to analyze their loads, and sellers will
be motivated to embrace and offer distributed generation, conservation
measures, and enhanced metering technologies.

Imagine a State whose people within a well-defined geographical boundary
are able to select their default provider.  This is the vision of
Community Choice.  It will bring stability and order to our very
successful spot energy exchanges: the California PX Day-Ahead Market,
and APX=01,s  green energy market. These spot markets will continue to grow
and flourish, and continue to provide instantly transparent prices to
eveyone, just as they do today.  However, with only two or three
dominant buyers as we have now, these spot markets may atrophy, and may
perish.  Dominant buyers are able to redirect their volumes from these
exchanges on a whim, causing tremendous swings in volume, additional
price volatility, and a great deal of uncertainty, and instability when
it is least needed.  Alternatively, when there are many buyers, all of
whom are accountable to their local citizenry, and all of who seek a
reasonable balance between spot purchases, and term purchases, the
situation will become more stable, efficient, and less prone to sudden
changes.

We encourage this Committee to take a hard look at Community Choice as a
way to share the benefits of competition, keep the State on its
progressive course, and provide a timely correction to a system that
will earn the trust and confidence of the public.

Thank you

that, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=018 lamented Dave.  =01&He just
wanted to see how far he could push me. That=01,s what I mean when I say
the traders are jigging it.=018

=01&But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is
what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess
at the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess
wrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on
to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of

As per a voicemail I left you today, one of the Enron Global Markets Teams 
(Global Risk Markets) is awaiting the reversal of a check (to Goldman Sachs) 
that was wired out instead.  Kortney Brown and Dana Davis had worked with you 
and Lupy Spencer on this before.  Last anyone heard, it had made it to your 
desk.

I was checking to see if that was the case and if there would be any 
difficulty in voiding a legacy MSA check on the new SAP system.  Please let 
me know what you find or if you need any further information.

      OFO Stage :                        2
      Inventory Level :                 High
      Noncompliance Charge :    $1.00/Dth
      Tolerance Band :                11%
     

PG&E's CGT has called a High Inventory System Wide OFO for flow day 12/29/2001.

High Inventory:  Customer supply is required to be within the tolerance band percentage of daily
usage to avoid OFO noncompliance charges.  Supply lower than usage is not subject to OFO
 noncompliance charge.

Charges for Noncompliance:

-   Noncore customers with AMR and PG&E's Electric Generation charges are based on actual
    daily metered usage.
-   Noncore customers without AMR charges are based on ADQ
    or actual daily metered usage, whichever results in a lesser charge.
-  Core Procurement Group charges are based on the latest core load forecast.


Please call the CGT Helpline 1-800-343-4743 if you have any questions.

256,"I need the following........

Assume we are in the new building and we have technical problems that force us out of the building either due to IT connection issues or problems with the building itself (AC, power, etc.). If we do have to leave the plan is to have the 30th floor completely available in this building as a backup for both the gas and power side. Obviously space is limited so what we will do is only bring the people that need to be in the building to get noms out and send the others home to handle business remotely. One approach is to take the EDI pipes and have them go to the 30th floor to ensure they have the support and quicker system then if they did their noms from home. Using this approach, and considering the space constraint please give me the number of desks you will need on the 30th floor. I'm open to suggestions so if you have a different approach or some good ideas feel free to share them. I need this by Friday 7/27 no later than noon.

269,"Dear friends:

The departure of Jeff, like losing a member of your family, is never a pleasant experience.  He has created immense wealth for the Enron shareholder over his eleven or so years at Enron.  We will all miss him. 

However, this is in our rear view mirror and we need to move forward to reach our goals.  I want to share a number of key points that should be well communicated and understood:
	a) Ken is re-assuming the CEO role one that he has held for nearly fifteen years except for the last six months.  He understands this company.  He built Enron.  He is prepared to lead this company into the future for as long as it takes to reach our goals;
	b) The investment community knows Ken and likes his approach.  This is probably an upside given Jeff's struggles with this group;
	c) The key leaders in the organization across all of Enron, including Greg Whalley, John Lavorato, Mark Frevert, Jim Fallon, Stan Horton amongst many others, are clearly committed to Enron and its goals.  We are all firmly aligned behind Ken;
	d) There is no change to Enron's strategies and business principles going forward;
	e) The committment to the retail business is un-wavering.  Support for EES, within Enron, is at its highest in years;
	f) There is a very deep talent base in Enron and all key origination, trading and finance people are under contract; and
	g) My committment to our employees, Enron and the retail energy business continues without question.

There will be a lot of distractions for the next few days; it is very important that we move on and stay focused.  The retail and wholesale energy business must reach its short and long term goals.  I am confident we will be successful.

I am hoping to set up a number of floor meetings today to further discuss and answer any questions.  

Regards
Dave"

274,"He's not a nazi, he's a commie.  Actually he's a democrat but such subtle 
distinctions escape me.  What MKM is talking about is a conversation I had in 
DC with a buddy of mine who is a commissioner on the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission.  He said there is a move afoot to expand regulation of 
financial products like weather hedges, spark spread swaps and similar 
industry specific instruments that his agency has not regulated in the past.  
(they just regulate the commodity exchanges like the NYMEX, Chicago Board of 
Trade, etc.)  He also made it sound like Enron Online had made his staff 
people more nervous about the lack of regulation over those kinds of 
products.  The current strategy, he explained, was to solve the problem of 
the CFTC's arguable lack of jurisdiction over such products by getting the 
agencies with jurisdiction over the industry to which such products were 
being sold (i.e., the FERC as to energy products) to regulate the stuff based 
on the CFTC's guidance.  I assume that Kean's group is on top of this, but I 
haven't had the chance to check yet.  I talked to a guy in the DC office 
about 6 months about CFTC issues and will follow up with him on Monday and be 
sure they are aware of this leftist plot.  I can't remember his name just 
now, but he works for Cynthia Sandherr, I think.  I'll let you know what is 
going on after I talk to those folks.  DF

281,"The whole thing also bugs me on an intuitive level, but I'm not sure it is a 
legal conflict of interest.  The Northern cases he is involved in are not 
really  ""GISB matters.""  There are certainly issues like the 637 compliance 
issue that involve GISB standards, however.  GISB is a freestanding entitity 
and his representation does not equate to representation of Enron so he could 
claim that his only client interest to worry about is GISB itself.  As long 
as he does not take positions in Northern cases that are inconsistent with 
what GISB wants, he's technically OK.  I suspect he'd argue that his work in 
the Northern docket is completely consistent with GISB's objective of 
achieving world domination.  This was my from the hip analysis when Jay first 
showed up in our cases, so I may have missed something.  For example, I'm not 
really clear on GISB's structure.  Can we argue that it is not a real stand 
alone entity but rather  a ""front"" for a cooperative group of companies that 
includes Enron?  If so, we might have a real conflict.  Thanks. DF

284,"I spoke with Dick Vincent who indicated that we will have no problem 
obtaining 12 mos renewable business interruption insurance when we go 
operational on gas.  This should solve the warranty issue with the banks 
because it covers defects, design, and workmanship on the turbines and 
includes lost profits, etc.  Incidentally, for insurance purposes the 
turbines are designated DE3 which is not a new technology designation. 


Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a 
supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the 
insurer.  In the case where the supplier does not pay or the warranty has 
ended then the insurer will pay.


Now we just need to come up with a fix for the drop dead date.

323,"Please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from May 2000 and May 
2001.  There are two tabs, one tab contains the days May 16-18, 2000 and the 
other tab contains the days May 14-18, 2001.  Each tab contains both the load 
data and temp data particular to the days in question.  The days most 
directly comparable are May 17, 2001 (Thursday) and May 18, 2000 (Thursday), 
although the two days preceding May 18, 2000 were slightly warmer than the 
two days preceding May 17, 2001.  The peak on 5/17/2001, 44,923 MW, is 2.78% 
higher than the peak on 5/18/2000, 43,709 MW.  With similarly warm days 
before 5/17/2001 as there were before 5/18/2000, the peak would obviously 
have been even higher.  This would put the year-over-year growth in excess of 
3%.  I believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year-over-year 
from an earlier analysis, somewhere in the range of 3.5% to 4%.  

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

I just wanted to mention a few things.  I'm sure you are doing them already 
most of the time, but they really need to be done on each and every deal.

Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field
Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in 
Tagg
Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg
Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal
Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for 
every EOL deal
Manually rebook every EOL deal that fails - If you have trouble doing this, 
just let me know and I'll follow up.

349,"Hello, Sweetness! Sorry I didn't get back to you right away. You guys should
come here! It is awesome! Jody, Eric Neibhur, and I drove up into the
mountains on Sunday and played in the snow. It was awesome. We got there in
less than an hour after stopping twice to look at the view. I tried to make
a snow angel, but it was more of an ice angel, really. Neither Jody nor Eric
had gloves, so they weren't too keen on making snowballs and throwing them
at me. Still, we had a great time.

Sat. we went to see this performance group Fischerspooner in sort of the
equivalent of the Rice Hotel while it was under construction. They wore
crazy costumes and danced around and sang over djed music. It was pretty
cool, especially since we snuck in the back door, even though it was free,
since we didn't have reservations. (I made an animation of it. I'm trying to
figure out how to put it online for y'all!) Then we went to Chinatown for
art openings, and that was really cool. Then we went to a renovated bowling
alley to see a secret show by Kim Deal, but she didn't play cuz supposedly
Kelly Deal got married that day. But there was an alright band w/ the most
Amazingly cute girl singer, so it all good.

So you guys have to come here! Come here! C'mere!

See yu on Fri at Jessica's opening at Lawndale, then on Sat at the wedding.
Yeah!!!!!

351,"John,

The calcskew function was written in Excel VB for your option pricing model. 
The function has performed well for
the number of times it is used in your model. I took a look at your 
spreadsheet, and had a few IT programers take
a look at it as well. For the amount of times you're calling the function in 
the new spreadsheet, Excel VB is not 
the appropriate language for the function. My suggestion to you is that for 
these more calculation-intensive workbooks,
we use a function developed in C\C++.  I spoke with Paulo, and he will be 
looking into this, and will get in touch with you
today.

Monday January 28, 2002
Summer-type ridge in the SE to get beaten down by approaching U.S. storm.
Trough to develop in the East turning the pattern to a normal to below
normal temperature regime.
We are looking at a deep trough in the West and strong ridge in the East on
this mornings weather maps. Dozens of record highs were set this weekend
from the Plains eastward while it was cold enough in the NW for snow in
Seattle. Things are on the move now which should end the warmth for most
areas by the end of the week. Relative to recent weeks, it certainly looks
a lot colder, but when one considers the time of year and steps back, well
most areas just don't get that cold. This looks to me to be the type of
situation where it will be colder in the Plains and then modify as it heads
East. This has a similar feel to what happened in late December. At the
moment, we are devoid of snow cover, so I have a difficult time getting too
pumped up over all of this. Speaking of snow, the Western U.S. system may
produce some moderate snows over the far North and Lakes as it pushes from
the High Plains NE to Canada. This does not appear to be a situation that
favors any East Coast winter storm development. Short term numbers will
still show warmth in the East, but that is a function of the next couple of
days. The Western and Central U.S. temperature departures are already below
normal and that trend will shift East later this week.
The 6-10 day period looks chilly, but hardly cold and also may be very
quiet. The SE ridge is replaced by a trough in the means so we should not
see the recent spring regime. The trend over the Western part of the
continent ( US and Canada) is for Pacific zonal flow. The real bitter cold
that has been in Canada the last several weeks should gradually modify. We
will likely see two distinct branches in the jet stream, an arctic branch
in the North and subtropical branch in the South. We get our big storms and
bitter cold outbreaks when they phase(come together). Most of the extreme
forecasts you see come together when this phasing occurs. I can not rule
out in the future, but it looks unlikely to me for now. To me the bottom
line for this period( and beyond) is for a slight cold bias East and a
close to normal look elsewhere.
For the period Monday January 28 through Friday February 1, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Desert SW,
California, Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3- degrees below normal: Plains and Rockies...
Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Mississippi Valley...
Average 10 to 15-degrees above normal: Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic,
Northeast, Gulf Coast, Southeast...

Weather Headlines
Friday October 19 , 2001
***  Zonal flow keeps the short term quiet. Major jet stream amplification
expected in the medium range with arctic outbreak possible.***
     A weak cold front is crossing the Midwest today, but with very little
change in sensible weather. The only significant storminess over the next
several days would be a heavy rain threat over the Southern half of Florida
and a moderate rain threat in the Pacific NW. When I last wrote on Monday,
I discussed the potential for a trough to form in the Western U.S. It
clearly has not happened though I mentioned that a zonal flow would also
accomplish the forecasted warm up. This milder air should stay in place
into the middle of next week. The Western Atlantic ridge has also
strengthened in recent days which should force Gulf and East coast
temperatures to go above normal by early next week after a couple of more
coolish days. There are no named storms in the tropics at this time. A
couple of flare-ups in the Caribbean bear watching, but likely would not
develop until Monday at the earliest, if then.
Weather patterns in the 6-10 day range should become much more interesting
and bullish. All of the models forecast a strong dip of the polar jet to
occur into the Plains late next week. There are some discrepancies in the
intensity and how fast it moves East. However, given some very strong winds
in the Pacific and some very cold air now over the Arctic, I expect this to
be significant. Persistence also should pay off in this forecast. These
troughs have not had any problem digging into the Eastern U.S. since Labor
Day while troughs into the West have been non-existence. This could be
giving us clues on how the winter will go. The good news is that will aid
in verifying my winter outlook, the bad news is it could result in a long
season in the East. Specifics can wait until next week as the event gets
closer. A couple of highlights though would likely be accumulating snows in
the Northern U.S. and double digit below normal temperatures invading the
Plains and spreading East. As is usually the case, a strong trough in the
East results in significant ridging(with warmer, drier air) in the Western
U.S.
For the period October 19 through October 23, expect the following
temperature trends:
Average 1 to 3 degrees below normal: Gulf Coast, Ohio Valley, Northeast,
Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Northern Rockies, Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Plains, Mississippi Valley,
California,  Central Rockies...
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Desert SW, Intermountain West,
Southern Rockies...
Unspecified areas will average close to normal..."

?	The trader now has the ability to fill limit orders that appear at the top of the trader's stack on both sides. 
?	The order will now be filled at the full order volume regardless of the trader's stack volume.
?	Filling an order will not move the trader's price or cause a hedge to occur.

Resize floated stack windows- (Effective Tuesday September 25)

You will now have the ability to resize the stack window to the desired extent.

Website Changes ( Effective Monday September 24)

Limit Order Restrictions on Physical Transactions -
?	Customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions. If a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it.
?	If a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price, both orders will be cancelled. The customer would have effectively transacted with himself.

Here is the spreadsheet for valuing and hedging the quanto swap. It prices the swap for one day. Please note the delta position on gas that needs to be taken since inception. The gas position changes as we enter into the correlated period (hit F9 to see different scenarios). 

For the sake of simplicity I used a zero interest rate (that does not change the hedging issues). ""TS"" is the ticker size (MMBTUs/HDDs). I made it the unit for simplicity also. 

 
Let me know your questions and opinion.
Paulo Issler 


 "
431,"John,

You are correct, when you compute the historical volatility you need to use 
252 days to annualize the volatility.
This is because the historical data only existed for trading days. 

The common practice here at Enron for computing Time to maturity is Calendar 
Days (= Maturity date - valuation date).
Therefore the days in Year is 365.25.  So the implied volatility from the 
EIMPVOL function uses 365.25 days as one year.

If you want to convert you can apply the following formula

historical vol * sqrt(252)    vs.  implied vol * sqrt(365.25).

Let me know if this helps.

437,"Dear John,

I had a meeting with Phillip after our morning discussion about P&L and it 
seems that there may be some issues regarding how I run my book.  It was my 
mistake about whether or not the put options for April Socal were booked 
properly.  The options were booked properly by Larry May and my Book runners 
and the profit was realized for 03/08.   My apologies for declaring that the 
options were not in my position.  Also, the tolls curves are not treated as 
schedule C.  I will adjust the tolls curves to account for basis curveshift 
as needed.  My P&L did not match the Socal position because of physical index 
curveshift and an adjustment to transport.  

The discussion and feedback from Phillip regarding your conversation with him 
concerns me.  I am confident that I run the most accurate physical and 
financial trading book within Enron.   I will stand on the fact that no one 
within the market has a better understanding of his/her position better than 
I.  The physical/financial risk in my book is managed to a standard not seen 
at Enron since I have been here.   Few people realize the great lengths I go 
to to manage the risk in the IM West trading book.  

I am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it 
is responsible for communicating with you directly.  Let's get together and 
discuss exactly what my responsibilities to you will be going forward.   It 
may be that I relied to heavily on my subordination to Phillip Allen up until 
this point.  This may have contributed to my miscommunication with you.  I 
will see that this will not happen in the future.  Thank you for all of my 
added responsibilities.

Sincerely,

BCS bowls starting to fill up

  _____  

By Brad Edwards
Special to ESPN.com


Two spots are now taken.

Six spots remain.

But the two most enviable positions in the Bowl Championship Series are still up for grabs. The next couple of weekends (maybe three) will decide which teams play for the national title, although the list of potential competitors seems to be shrinking.

Stock up: Oklahoma
The Sooners are just two wins away from Pasadena, as are Nebraska and Miami. The difference, however, is that one of Oklahoma's remaining games is at home against a team with a 3-7 record (Oklahoma State). Rivalry games are often unpredictable, but the Cowboys don't have much of a chance in this one. Not this year. Not against this team.

That puts OU in the Big 12 title game against the winner of Nebraska-Colorado. It's a neutral-field game for a chance to defend their national title, and a team with a loss can't ask for much more than that.

Stock down: BYU
The Cougars keep winning, which of course, is the object of football. But a very weak schedule and some tiny victory margins aren't earning them any respect in the computers. And even though BYU is more interested in gaining admiration from Fiesta Bowl reps than from computer analysts, it won't do them any good unless they reach the top 12 of the final BCS Standings. 

If they do get that high in the rankings, is certainly an advantage to have a fan base within driving distance of Arizona at a time when many Americans are hesitant to fly. But the reality is that the Fiesta Bowl is being played in the traditional Rose Bowl time slot on New Year's Day and will likely have Pac-10 champion Oregon as one of its participants. With that much in place, the Big Ten champ becomes a very attractive opponent -- especially if that team is Michigan. It's too bad for BYU that the Wolverines dodged the upset bullet over the weekend.

Michigan is just one home victory away from being in the BCS pool, and it's very tough to imagine any bowl selecting the Cougars over the Wolverines, given a choice between the two. BYU has a good team, a good name and a loyal following of fans, but they can't match Michigan's drawing power. Unless the Fiesta Bowl believes it needs the Cougars to sell out the stadium, they probably won't be going to Tempe to ring in the New Year. BYU won its national title by beating Michigan in the 1984 Holiday Bowl, but this bowl battle is likely to be won be the Maize and Blue. 

Under the radar
The ACC (Maryland) and Pac-10 (Oregon) have both determined their BCS representative, and the Big East (Miami) is all but official. And one way or the other, the Big Ten champion will also be determined by this Saturday. So, even though the Big 12 and SEC teams won't be decided until December, it's time to start making some guesses about who will get the at-large bids. The reality is that there won't be many teams to choose from. If Tennessee had lost to Kentucky and Michigan had lost to Wisconsin on Saturday -- both of which almost happened -- that might have presented a scenario in which there were no eligible at-large teams from the ACC, Big East, Big Ten or SEC. And since the Big 12 can't get more than two teams into the BCS, and Oregon has already played both Stanford and Washington State, everything would have played perfectly into the hands of an undefeated BYU.

The order of choice by the BCS bowls is dependent upon which teams are playing for the national title, but if things play out according to form and a Big 12 team finishes at No. 1, the Fiesta will get the first pick. If they choose the Big Ten champion, the Sugar Bowl will likely take another Big 12 team with one at-large selection, and the other choice should be the Tennessee-Florida loser to the Orange Bowl. If the Fiesta does take BYU as an at-large pick, that second team from the Big 12 would go to either the Sugar or the Orange. 

Florida still needs two losses from the group of Nebraska, Miami and Oklahoma to have a good chance to reach the Rose Bowl, but they might have been in even bigger trouble if not for a narrow escape by Tennessee over the weekend. The Vols are the only team the Gators can still get bonus points for a win against, and those would have been all but gone if Tennessee had lost to Kentucky.

Oklahoma is certainly in good shape if they win out and all else goes according to form, but there is one ""what if?"" scenario to think about. If Texas loses at Texas A&M and Colorado beats Nebraska on Friday, would Oklahoma still finish higher than Florida if both teams win out? The Texas loss would cost the Sooners some bonus points, and the Nebraska loss would prevent them from having an opportunity to pick up more. It's too early to know the impact of that series of events, but it is something for OU fans to think about over Thanksgiving dinner.

Texas has been all but eliminated from the national title hunt after Oklahoma's win at Texas Tech. The only remaining hope for the Longhorns is an Oklahoma State upset of the Sooners in Norman. Good luck. If Colorado beats Nebraska this week and then Oklahoma the following week in the Big 12 Championship Game, that might leave Texas as the highest ranked team from the conference, but it would not be enough to get them into the BCS top two unless Florida or Miami also loses.

If the season ended today ...
The top three still look the same, and all those behind them are trying to keep hope alive.

BCS Game of the Week: Nebraska at Colorado
It's hard to believe a team could be 11-0 without winning any type of crown, but that's the reality the Cornhuskers carry into Boulder. The winner of this game gets the Big 12 North championship and a trip to Dallas for the conference title. A loss might instead send Nebraska to Dallas for the Cotton Bowl.

This game is not only to keep the Huskers' title hopes alive, but as referenced above, it could also have an effect on the BCS futures of Oklahoma, Texas and Florida, as well as Tennessee and Oregon. Throw in the fact that this game normally comes down to the wire, and you can sense the drama it might present all across the country.

- THIS JUST IN FROM ONE OUR 575,000 USERS!

I just want to take a minute and tell you what a terrific 
job you all are doing there at INO.com. 

A while back I asked my broker if there was some way to get 
current, Intraday price updates on their otherwise very 
good on-line system. He said ?No?.  Then said, ?Wait a 
minute- try INO.com, they can give you 10 and 30-minute 
updates at no charge.? 

Well, it's been an enlightening experience every day since. 
While the Lee Gettess product didn't work out for me, the 
John Crane Reversal Day product is proving very insightful 
and was the catalyst for a few successful trades this week. 

I look forward to my morning, evening and weekly extreme 
market updates and I plan to shop at the INO store on many 
occasions in the future to take advantage of the many 
excellent educational opportunities there. 

My 'Portfolio' and 'Quote Board' window allow me to draw a 
much sharper bulls-eye and hit my upside targets with much 
greater accuracy than in the past. I've been trading for a 
few years now and have always enjoyed it, but you've injected 
a new vitality and brought a new life to the markets for me. 

Just yesterday, when exiting a long Bean position for a 
modest but appreciated profit I thanked my broker for 
turning me on to INO.com and I meant it. 

You all are doing a bang-up job and I personally think a 
lot of 'dotcom' start up outfits could do a lot worse than 
to take a look at your approach and the way you cater to 
your clientele. 

Keep up the good work, it's greatly appreciated.

Would it be possible to keep Liz in our weekend rotation for a while to help Shannon out?

Daniel will probably be ready to go into the rotation in about a month but until then Shannon would have to work every weekend until then. Let me know if that is something we can work out.

restriciting the access to these sensitive reports, but I don't agree with 
removing myself from those allowed to review positions.  I not only run one 
of the largest financial books on the floor, but I also manage the West

months ago.  While Phillip acts as manager of the sub books in the west, I am

back to the cash strategy of the desk each morning.  Let's start testing the 
market, find the support and resistance each day.  It would be nice to have 
EOL change the stack manager so that we can switch a product from manage 
market depth to last trade is mid with the click of a button, and not go 
through the product properties.  I'll call them tomorrow.

Let's also decide on a time to close the products each morning.  We want to 
send the message of reliability, but also allow our Ops group to balance and 
nom.  I want to begin trading the next day cash by 11:01 am every day.  This 
would stay active until 4:00.

The push is for PHYSICAL.  Our edge over the market will be phys.  From risk 
to the ability to nominate and invoice, the other platforms will never see it 
coming. What are the chances that ICE and espeed will deal with el paso 
flows?  If information is the reason for EOL, then this will provide it.  It 
all seems so simple - Fixed priced physical, just when you thought it was old

all benefit under the new mantra.

458,"Mike:

	It seems to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways.  Those alternatives are as follows:

		1.  We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount.

		2.  If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the
		    amount we are paying them.  Of course, we would need to provide them some 
		    sort of explanation.

	My preference at this time would be to do the first item.  If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter.  If that letter brought no response, then we could consider taking the action outlined in the second item.

	I trust all is well with you.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,

Jeff

459,"The differences we had on Friday were mainly volume related. Correcting the deal in SITARA and UNIFY relates to volume actualizations.  It is not pricing related. As we talked about there are still some issues on the redwood gas.  Redwood gas is the gas relating to the underdelivereis.  In otherwords, when Palo Alto ""Burns"" less than we actualy schedule on the transport.  Presumably we sell this gas to other 3rd parties, and Palo Alto will be reimbursed for the variable transportation.  I do not think ther are additional fees we would pay on top of reimburseing them for the variable costs, but I am not 100% certain.

Please let me know if ther are any other questions.

Thanks

ENERGY COMMISSION SCHEDULES HEARING, TOUR OF PROPOSED POWER PLANT SITE IN 
CHINO

Sacramento -- The California Energy Commission has scheduled a hearing and 
site tour for members of the public and other parties interested in learning 
about a 180-megawatt summer reliability generation facility proposed for 
construction this summer on the grounds of the California Institution for Men 
in Chino.

The Pegasus Project in San Bernardino County is being proposed by Pegasus 
Power Partners, LLC, part of Delta Power Company LLC. The simple cycle 
peaking facility would consist of four 45-megawatt natural gas-fired turbines 
equipped with state-of-the-art air pollution control features. Three of the 
four units would be producing power by September 30, 2001, with the fourth 
unit coming on-line by March 31, 2002. All four units are being considered 
under the Energy Commission's emergency process, which should take 
approximately 21 days to complete.

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/peakers/chino/documents

A site tour and informational hearing was held on the project on Wednesday, 
May 16, 2001.

Site Visit
Assemble at 5:30 p.m.
Chino City Hall
13220 Central Avenue
Chino, California
Sacramento, CA
(Bus transportation will be provided to proposed site.)

Informational Hearing
Beginning at approximately 6:30 p.m., following the site visit.
Chino City Hall
13220 Central Avenue
Chino, California
Sacramento, CA
(Wheelchair Accessible)

Landowners, members of the general public and interested agencies are 
encouraged to participate in the site visit and the informational hearing on 
the licensing of the proposed Pegasus project.

Since this site visit will be conducted inside the California Institute for 
Men, waivers and special restrictions on dress may be required of those 
taking the tour. Please consult the Energy Commission's Public Advisor, 
Roberta Mendonca, no later than May 14, 2001, for details before signing up. 
Her office can be contacted by e-mail at . Her office can also assist 
interested individuals and organizations and provide information on 
participating in the Commission's emergency siting process. For information 
about proposed projects in Southern California, call (800) 273-4459.

Typically, peakers are simple-cycle power plants that can be constructed in a 
relatively small area and can be readily connected to existing transmission 
and natural-gas systems. For the Pegasus Project, these systems already exist 
nearby because of a 27-megawatt cogeneration power plant that operates at the 
California Institution for Men.

The Pegasus Project applied to the Energy Commission's emergency siting 
process to meet this summer'selectricity needs. The goal of the emergency 
process is to license power plants that can be on-line by September 30, 2001, 
without sacrificing the public's health or safety or California's environment.

The Commission's Public Adviser, Roberta Mendonca, can assist interested 
individuals and organizations and provide information on participating in the 
Commission's emergency siting process. Persons may contact Ms. Mendonca by 
e-mail at . For information regarding proposed projects in Northern 
California, call (877) 602-4747. For information about projects proposed in 
Southern California, call (800) 273-4459.

Information about the proposed project is available on the Energy 
Commission's Web Site at:

"
481,"oh yeah.  Well anyway, hope you have a good week.  Take care."
482,"John, I will have Sharon try to set something up with you, Mark H., Milly and 
McKay for later this week.

Yes, Blakes did drop us. 

It is not so much that they dropped us, but how they dropped us.  By way of 
background, Blakes had been working on the matter for approx. 6 weeks and 
knew or ought to have known that Westcoast was involved.  Last week after we 
commenced the law suit, Westcoast went ballistic, and last Monday Dan 
Fournier called to tell me  that Blakes had a legal conflict with Westcoast 
(which he knew was BS).  I told him it was not a legal conflict, but a 
business conflict and that it was too late to raise the issue in the middle 
of an injunction application, but, although we were not happy about it, as a 
favour to Blakes we would consider moving the file after the injunction 
application, when it made sense and in a manner that did not adversely affect 
us.  He seemed OK with that, but later that day, I again spoke to Fournier 
who admitted that it was not a legal conflict but a business conflict, that 
they were in an awkward position with Westcoast, and that he had a conference 
call with the Chairman and the Managing Partner of his firm in Toronto 
Tuesday morning, as well as the partner responsible for Westcoast.  He also 
warned me that Dalton McGrath would be wearing it internally within Blakes if 
there was a problem with Westcoast (I assume hoping to guilt me into moving 
the file).  I told him that was unfortunate but that I could not agree to 
anything that put Enron in a difficult position or adversely affected our 
interests. I spoke to Milly that night, who agreed, and on Tuesday morning 
phoned Fournier and told him again that although we were not pleased, we 
would move the file to another firm as soon as possible after we got through 
the injunction hearing.  Fournier called me back later that day after his 
call with his Toronto partners and told me that, notwithstanding our repeated 
offers to move the file in an orderly fashion after the injunction 
application, that Blakes had made a decision that the file had to be moved 
immediately, such that they could not represent us on the injunction 
application or continue to appear as solicitors of record.  They said the 
factors looked at in deciding between us and Westcoast were the length of the 
relationships, annual billings, complexity of work, strategic importance of 
the work, and their policy of not acting against established clients.  It is 
notable that the injunction is sought only against Enerdata and NGX, and not 
Westcoast, which I pointed out to Fournier, and that I had previously given a 
reasonable solution to Blakes to solve a problem of their own making.  
Fournier also admitted that we are a strategic client, with more complex work 
and higher annual billings.  In other words, I think it was all crap, and we 
lost out to a senior Blakes Toronto partner who did not pay attention when to 
the matter when Blakes first took it on and who, after the fact, is looking 
after an upset Toronto client in a way that put us in an awkward position and 
makes us look weak to Westcoast.

I should point out that Robert Anderson and Dalton McGrath have handled the 
situation excellently, and have been working hard to transition the file 
while I try to find replacement counsel, and opposed the decision of their 
Toronto office at their own personal expense.  I think Fournier wanted to do 
likewise, but he ultimately is more political and accommodated the politics 
of his firm, which is disappointing.
  




"
483,"I have a concern about Enron's forward-looking exposure associated with legacy deals (deals that existed during the June 2000 through the May 2001 price shock).  If Edison gets its way, all customers will pay for Edison's under-recovery from June 2000 through January 2001 plus CDWR spot market purchases during 2001.  This would take the form of a surcharge on future bills.  My concern is that Enron will be on the hook for these future charges associated with past under-collections -- even beyond the term of our legacy deals.  For example, if a deal ends in March 2002 we could be on the hook for surcharges that a legacy customer would receive on its bill after that date, provided the surcharge pertained to costs incurred by the utility during the time that the legacy customer was ours.

I have not received clear guidance from legal on this matter.  For example, I asked both Mike Smith and Steve Hall to review the legacy Safeway contract which is on PGES paper.  They both indicated that there is a better chance than not that we are on the hook for these charges, although good arguments could be made that we should not be responsible for them.  Angela Schwarz indicated to me that outside counsel (I'm not sure who) thinks that we are not on the hook for these charges.

It is critical that we get clear guidance from legal on these risks.  We are in front of customers now deciding whether or not to go forward with extensions or terminate contracts after the initial term.  Customers are asking us to make changes to our ""change in law"" and ""utility non-performance"" provisions.  If we believe that we are wearing the surcharge risks beyond the term of the existing contract and the customer is willing to take those from us in exchange for changes to the master agreement we would probably be willing to do it.  If we aren't currently wearing surcharge risk beyond the term of the existing contract then our negotiating position would be different.

As you all know, the magnitude of this risk is potentially large as our negative CTC receivable is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  If the CPUC were to adopt Edison's proposal for the entire state, EES' customers would be responsible for surcharges of the same magnitude.  At this point, I don't know whether EES or its customers are on the hook for this risk beyond the term of existing contracts.



Vicki -- could you forward this message to Mike Smith.  I couldn't tell which Mike Smith to send it to.

489,"We have put together the following list of issues for the request for 
rehearing of the FERC's November 15 order.  We would appreciate your input 
about whether to pursue these issues and we will still have to decide who 
will write up the various issues (Alan, Bracewell, WPTF, or EPSA).  Requests 
for rehearing are due on January 14, 2001.

We oppose doing away with the opportunity cost standard under the soft cap 
and not establishing a standard of reasonable profit
$150 cap too low (is there any point in raising this issue again?)
Benchmarks for forward contracts - The FERC should clarify that it will not 
be applying this to anything other than Cal IOU contracts.
The FERC should clarify its statement that ""to the extent the IOUs' resources 
exceed their load at various times, they are free to sell any surplus at 
wholesale, pursuant to their Commission-filed rates schedules.""  A literal 
interpretation of this sentence will limit liquidity in the market and 
prohibit the IOUs from taking advantage of spreads between where their 
generation and load is located.  We don't care about the IOUs trading options 
but we are concerned about less liquidity.
Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power (and PUC's request 
for protective order) - This issue is a placeholder pending input from 
Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs.
We oppose the 27-month refund period
We oppose allowing the state a role in governance (WPTF)

paid the cost of cover for exports"

491,"I talked to Jim Huemiller (with LeBoeuf Lamb) who is Enron's bankruptcy 
counsel about whether we need to file with FERC a ""Suggestion of Bankruptcy"" 
rather than simply answer the PX's answer.  

In a bankruptcy case, there is an automatic stay on actions against the 
debtor or the debtor's property.  Joe questioned whether the stay applies to 
our complaint at FERC because of Section 362(b) of the Bankruptcy code which 
excepts from the stay proceedings commenced by governmental units for the 
exercise of police and regulatory power.

According to Jim, the Bankruptcy court may oppose a sanction for violation of 
the stay.  He says there is question of whether Section 362(b) applies to our 
complaint because we initiated it, not FERC.  I said it could be argued 
whether FERC initiated it under the language of Section 206 of the Federal 
Power Act.  While he agreed there may be legitimate arguments in that regard, 
he said that the FERC would want to delay issuing an order until after the 
court allowed it to act because its order could be deemed a nullity if it 
violated the automatic stay.  

He also said that if the PX did not (contrary to its promise) file to except 
the FERC's proceeding from the stay, two things could happen.  EPMI could 
itself file with the bankruptcy court and/or try to get the Court of 
establish a trustee in the case. *  Apparently, there was a conference call 
with Elizabeth Sager and others where it was decided that we needed to file 
this ""Suggestion of Bankruptcy.""

* Since the PX's bankruptcy was filed under Section 11 rather than Section 7 
of the bankruptcy code, the PX is still a ""debtor in possession"" and a 
trustee is not appointed unless parties request it and prove that one is 
warranted pursuant to the bankruptcy code.  "

"
499,"Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB
Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
""The Commission's authorization is being granted based on our findings...that the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States, thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market,"" FERC said in its draft order. ""Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way, the project's environmental impact will be minimized. Finally Transco's existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate."" 
Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002.  The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing (25,000 Dth/d), PECO Energy Co. (30,000 Dth/d), Reliant Energy Services (25,000 Dth/d) and Williams Energy Marketing (50,000 Dth/d) are all customers. The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is $13.56/Dth/month. 
The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC (see related story) covers a new pipeline that would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. The project is designed to deliver 700,000 Dth/d of gas to Southern Company's gas-fired generation in the Southeast. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral extension will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co.'s proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The project includes 13 miles of 20-inch diameter looping along ANR's Racine Lateral and a 10-mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant. The project would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003. 
In the Kern River case, shippers had requested rehearing of FERC's order granting Kern authorization for its 124,500 Dth/d 2002 Expansion Project and an additional 10,500 Dth/d under its revised California Action project. Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights. Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes. 
However, the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights, ""given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California."" 
Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in $1 Billion Southeast Pipe 
Houston-based Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, on Wednesday said the open season for the company's proposed $1 billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was ""extremely successful,"" adding that response to the 1 Bcf/d line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the company's expectations. The open season concluded on Sept. 19. 
The proposed 600-700 mile, 36-inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline, which was first announced in August, is expected to originate in Mobile, AL, and extend through the states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
""The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation, commercial, residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States,"" said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert. 
The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay, enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies, but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana, including Venice and the Henry Hub, according to Gulf South, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch LP. The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple third-party storage facilities, such as Gulf South's facility in Bistineau, LA. 
""We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region,"" said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo. 
In addition to serving power generation, the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline, bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before. 
Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year. He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined. Gulf South said the anticipated in-service date is sometime in 2004. 
Gulf South currently owns and operates 8,800 miles of pipeline with 33 compressor stations and 120 major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area. 
Williams Files to Build 400-Mile Western Frontier Pipe 
Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new $365 million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma. The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of 400 miles of 30-inch diameter pipe and 30,000 horsepower of compression. It would transport up to 540,000 Dth/d of gas to markets in the Midcontinent. 
In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines, including ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system. The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov. 1, 2003. 
""Western Frontier Pipeline is a cost-effective, environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent,"" said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president and general manager of Williams' Central and Texas Gas systems. ""We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region, which was recently cited by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.'' 
Customers interested in Western Frontier should contact Donny King at (270) 688-6968, Mark Elliott at (270) 688-6637 or Dale Sanders at (270) 688-6944. More information on Western Frontier is also available on the Internet at <http://westernfrontier.williams.com> .

502,"here's a revision to travis's draft for the private equity folks.

couple of comments for consideration at 2:00:

1.  we do not want to encourage a 338(h) 10 election for basis reasons that are different than existed in Northern.
2.  I have drafted as though TW is issuing the preferred, for tax reasons that may cost ENE +/- $30 million per year we want Newco 1 to issue.
3.  I am not convinced we want to offer same conversion terms as we did Dynegy.  Areas to think about removing or changing are (i) do we offer the makewhole and (ii) should we replace all ""repurchase"" scenarios with a redemption structure to avoid the whole change of control issue.  
4.  We need to add or relook at the exchange features given the private equity's motivation to participate in the closing of the merger.

Thanks

504,"I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all 
organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an 
innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods 
and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously 
submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code 
and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into 
SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by 
Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically 
routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved 
(again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the 
Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <
http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view 
these materials.

Who do I call for help?

But I think he's got alot of other stuff going on in his life now with job and friends and feels that he can't be committed to a relationship and knows he's not going to make the effort.  I don't know if that will change anytime soon or not.  I'm assuming it won't, but hoping it will.  Anyway, I'm just super-depressed now and my birthday is tomorrow!  This will not be a birthday to remember.  :(  I really wasn't ready for our relationship to end, and didn't think it was about to, really.  So, I have to deal with the shock as well as the sadness.

As part of the merger, NSP transferred its existing utility operations that were being conducted directly by NSP at the parent company level to a newly formed subsidiary of Xcel Energy named Northern States Power Company.

Because of the merger, the record was overlayed in Global Counterparty and all history for Northern States Power Company is now under Xcel Energy.  A new Northern States Power Company record has been created in Global.  I will be moving all Xcel deals with a July 1, 2001 forward flow date to the newly created record for Northern States Power Company.  Xcel Energy will be inactivated in Enpower.

This is a major victory for the Generator and Power Marketing  community...
 
In addition, FERC announces an upcoming technical conference  to allow industry to weigh in on the discussion and provide FERC with an  operation's perspective and illustrate possible ramifications of such extreme  measures as the ones FERC proposed in its November 20 order. 
 
Also of note, FERC directed transmission providers, who  perform studies pursuant to a request for interconnection, to treat unaffiliated  entities, at their request, as competing network resources in meeting load and  load growth and to post optimum areas (from a transmission perspective) on their  systems for locating prospective generation.

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to 
have
on the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The 
effort
of network design and construction currently under way is  unprecedented in 
terms
of its scope and complexity and it is important  for technical people, who 
often have
highly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.

I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) and
Saturday (April 29). I understand  that you have commitments on Thursday and 
Friday 
morning. We have reorganized the tentative agenda of the meeting to devote
Friday afternoon to more general topics.

Dynegy Power Marketing
Aquila Energy Marketing
Peco Energy Co. 
Municipal Energy Agency of Miss.; Lafayette Utilities System; and the 
Lousiana Energy and Power Authority (who pointed out that Entergy's proposal 
could,  perhaps, only work in a big, regional system and that Entergy had 
left SPP)
Coral Power, ELCON and Enron
VEPCO (who now owns an approved generation only control connected to Entergy 
and TVA.  VEPCO alerts FERC that Entergy already refused transmission with   
a sink at the new control area, even though Entergy asks for a May 22 
effective date.)
Louisiana Energy Users Group
Tenaska Power Services
El Paso Merchant Energy (asks FERC to promote gen. only control areas as 
""hubs"" in order to move more toward the gas model)

Finally, ComEd filed comments stating this is an important issue and FERC 
should resolve this before the summer.  ComEd did not take a position on 
whether Entergy's filing was good or bad.  Maybe ComEd's filing will get FERC 
to deny Entergy's request before the summer, rather than setting it for

617,"Chris Jensen, Executive Director of the Florida Energy Pipeline Association, 
has learned from some DEP agency contacts that the Alliance (operating behind 
the front organization known as Friends of the Aquifer, Inc.) has decided to 
drop their lawsuits appealing the denials of their petitions to more severely 
regulate pipelines in Florida.  While this is good news for those of us 
fighting the war here in Florida, the reason for this withdrawal of their 
appeals of failed efforts on three different petitions at the state level in 
Florida is because of their belief that their current activity at the Federal 
level holds greater promise of success and their desire to concentrate their 
resources in that effort.

My thoughts on this is that the pipeline industry should get organized and 
execute a ""full court press"" defense which is proactive as we move into 
increased future efforts at the  Federal level by the Alliance through their 
other front organizations.  These organizations have been created to burden 
pipeline competition to benefit the maritime interests.

From my vantage point I am limited to mostly what I see in the press, but  
these front organization are winning the battle in the national press that I 
have seen and heard.  AOPL and INGAA do not come across in the press as being 
equipped or prepared to handle the shaping of the pipeline safety issues in 
the press that these Alliance front organizations have been doing.

 Our Enron government affairs folks in Washington are knowledgeable, 
experienced and capable. They have been through this battle and other battles 
in the past.  So this is not a criticism, but just a friendly observation 
from a remote vantage point, that if the entire pipeline industry does not 
develop a proactive plan to shape the issues in the national media during the 
next year, we will find it very difficult or perhaps impossible to come out 
of Congress with legislation that is reasonable and workable from a safety 
regulation perspective.  It has been my experience with the Alliance in the 
past, that to any extent they are successful,  they will then multiply their 
efforts and broaden their field of attack.

The issue is not safety of pipelines, but competition for the transportation 
of energy.  We have an industry that can be very proud of it's record of 
safety, economic benefits, reliability, public service, energy efficiency and 
environmentally favorable service when compared to any other mode of 
transporting energy.  We have learned from our experiences, research and 
mistakes in the past and will continue to learn in the future so that future 
pipeline service will be even better for our people whom we serve.  

Our entire energy pipeline industry (natural gas and petroleum) needs to 
shape the issues in the national press and tell our very good story so the 
politicians are not overrun with public opinion shaped by our maritime 
competition. 

Thanks for your interest.  This is a ""heads-up"" that is probably not needed, 
but I felt that there might be something in it that would help with a very 
difficult current and future issue.

USA: Con Ed urges FERC to fix N.Y. wholesale electric market.

01/23/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Consolidated Edison Inc. , in an effort to 
protect its more than three million electric customers, urged the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to adopt mechanisms to reduce price 
spikes. 
At the opening of a two-day FERC hearing in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 22-23, 
Con Ed said in a statement it called for changes in the way the New York 
Independent System Operator (NYISO) administers the electric wholesale 
marketplace.
The NYISO was the entity authorized by the FERC to administer the state's 
competitive wholesale electric market. 
In addition, Con Ed called on the FERC to correct market flaws that allow 
power generators to exercise market power, and penalize those generators 
shown to be gaming the market to their own advantage. 
""The NYISO must take corrective action quickly to protect consumers and to 
assure them that the markets are indeed functioning efficiently and 
competitively,"" Con Ed said in its remarks. 
Con Ed is an holding company based in New York City that provides 
energy-related products and services through two regulated utility 
subsidiaries - Con Ed of New York Inc. and Orange and Rockland Electric Co. - 
and four competitive energy and telecommunications businesses. 
Con Ed proposed a new ""circuit breaker"" mechanism to hold prices down when 
the wholesale electric market was not competitive, which could occur when 
usage was high and power supplies were extremely tight. The circuit breaker 
would help prevent unreasonable price volatility. 
""Relative to estimated costs to produce energy, the energy markets frequently 
do not produce prices that are competitive, Con Ed said in its remarks to the 
FERC. 
Moreover, Con Ed said customers should be eligible for retroactive refunds if 
a power generator abuses the system and charges more than a competitive 
price. 
""Our customers must be protected from uncompetitive energy prices this 
summer,"" Con Ed of New York Inc. President Kevin Burke said. ""There must be 
strong consumer protection tools in place when the marketplace is not truly 
competitive."" 
""More generation sources will produce additional competition in the supply of 
electricity, resulting in lower costs to consumers. But until the new plants 
get on line, customers need additional protection from uncompetitive, 
inflated prices,"" Burke added. 
Since 1997, Con Ed said it has been reducing the portion of the electric bill 
it controls - the delivery of electrical power. 
Under an agreement approved by the New York State Public Service Commission 
last year, Con Ed was providing an additional $1.5 billion of reductions in 
delivery rates, which followed $1.1 billion in rate reductions granted in the 
1997 agreement. These new reductions will be in effect at least until 2005. 
The average Con Ed residential customer will save an additional $50 in 2001. 
The average large commercial customer will save about $1,000. 
However, the cost to Con Ed of buying electricity from power generators in 
the wholesale market has risen dramatically, which has in turn driven up 
customers' total energy costs because Con Ed passes those costs onto its 
customers.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas 
liquid (NGL) prices dropped early Tuesday, tracking weakening natural gas 
futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), players said. 
Conway, Kan. propane lost around a nickel to 78.50 cents a gallon in see-saw 
trade, while losing 3.75 cents to 76.25/77.00 cents a gallon in Mont Belvieu, 
Texas, traders said.
""The market is puking today, with gas down"" said one Midwest trader. ""Natural 
gas was the only thing propane was hanging its hat on, and now that's 
falling."" 
Midday, NYMEX natural gas futures were trading 47.70 cents lower at $6.98 per 
million British thermal units (mmBtu) amid continuing warm weather forecasts. 
Crude oil futures were down 63 cents to $29.17 a barrel on profit-taking 
ahead of the release of weekly industry stock data later in the afternoon. 
Conway isobutane, which soared to trade above $1.10 cents a gallon last week, 
subsided, dropping 12.25 cents to 86.00/89.75 cents a gallon on the day, 
players said. The sudden drops over the last two days were interpreted by 
players to mean that a few dealers were caught short last week, and dismissed 
talk of a supply shortage in the region. 
Belvieu isobutane was talked 1.75 cents weaker to be offered at 79.00 cents a 
gallon, dealers said. 
Meanwhile, ethanes also suffered heavy losses, with mix down 3.50 cents to be 
offered at 56.25 cents a gallon in Conway, and down 4.25 cents in Belvieu at 
57.75 cents a gallon. Belvieu purity lost 2.25 cents to trade at 59.75 cents 
a gallon. 
Normal butane lost a nickel in Conway to talk at 80.00/83.00 cents a gallon, 
while losing 3.25 cents to trade at 79.75 cents a gallon in Belvieu, dealers 
said. 
Natural gasoline lost a notional 1.75 cents to be offered at 82.50 cents a 
gallon for Enron barrels in Texas, while Kansas product lost 1.25 cents to 
talk at 83.00/84.50 cents a gallon, traders said.

California regulators may block sales of Nevada power plants

01/23/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

LAS VEGAS (AP) - The parent company of Nevada Power Co. says California 
regulators might stop it from selling its northern Nevada power plants. 
Sierra Pacific Resources told investors on Monday that if the deal is blocked 
it'll be harder to finance its $3.1 billion dollar acquisition of General 
Electric of Oregon from Enron Corp.
""It's more difficult if you can't sell the plants than if you can,"" said 
Steve Rigazio, Nevada Power president. 
Las Vegas-based Nevada Power and Reno-based Sierra Pacific want to sell all 
but two of their electricity generation plants. State and federal regulators 
ordered the companies to sell as a condition of their 1999 merger. 
But with power shortages, price spikes and rolling blackouts plaguing the 
West Coast, California legislators last week ordered California utilities not 
to sell power plants before January 2006. 
The new law might prevent Sierra Pacific Power from selling its power plants 
because it serves 40,000 customers in California's Lake Tahoe area. 
Nevada Power said the California law might also block its sale of the Mohave 
power station at Laughlin, Nev., for $134 million to AES Corp. 
Southern California Edison, the majority owner of Mohave, could be blocked by 
the California law. 
The Nevada utility wants to sell two groups of power plants for $545 million 
and has a third power plant on the sales block. 
Nevada's Legislature, which opens Feb. 5, might also prohibit power plant 
sales. 
The Southern Nevada Water Authority board, made up of elected city and county 
officials, last week voted to oppose Nevada power plant sales. The officials 
want to keep the plants as safeguards against high electricity prices. 
Tim Hay, chief of the attorney general's Bureau of Consumer Protection also 
said this month that the state's coal-fired power plants should not be sold. 
Hay argued that the coal plants could provide at least a minimum amount of 
low-cost electricity to Nevada homes and businesses.

The Outlook

LOS ANGELES

Helmut Ackermann founded L.A. Dye & Print Works Inc. 18
years ago, when he took over a bankrupt dye house. Today,
thanks to California's worsening energy crisis, L.A. Dye &
Print is back on the brink of closure.

Mr. Ackermann depends on natural gas to operate the
massive boilers and heaters used to color and dry fabrics.
He expects his December gas bill to have jumped to
$600,000 from $132,000 last January. Hammered by the
soaring costs, he has already closed one plant and
dismissed 40 people. Now, he says the jobs of his
remaining 660 workers are in jeopardy. ""If it stays the
way it is, we won't be around very long,"" Mr. Ackermann
says.

Stories like this are causing economists to worry that
California's economic troubles -- the energy crisis,
combined with a high-tech shakeout and growing labor
unrest in the entertainment industry -- could put more
drag on a U.S. economy that is already downshifting.
Chart: California and the World Economy

The World's largest economies by gross national product,
in trillions of US dollars:
US                      $8.4
Japan                   $4.1
Germany                 $2.1

Italy                   $1.1
China                   $1.0
Source: World Bank

The energy mess is ""one more negative added to the mix,""
says Tom Lieser, a senior economist at the University of
California at Los Angeles's Anderson Business Forecast. He
expects California to navigate its way through the
immediate crisis but worries about its longer-term impact.
Questions about the reliability and cost of the state's
power supply, for example, could threaten continued growth
of vital industries such as technology.

Some Wall Street economists worry that California's
problems could spill over and hurt the broader U.S.
economy. In a report titled ""California Unplugged -- A
Drag on Global Growth?"" Morgan Stanley Dean Witter warns
that California's energy crisis threatens to push up
production costs and make U.S. exports from the state,
which totaled $102.9 billion in 1999, less competitive on
world markets.

""Negatives tend to snowball, so what is happening in
California has the potential to exacerbate the weakness we
already are seeing in the U.S. economy,"" says Joseph
Quinlan, a Morgan Stanley economist.

Other states facing economic and financial trouble
wouldn't warrant such attention. But California not only
is the nation's largest state in terms of both population
and economic heft, but the Golden State also seemed to
epitomize the New Economy. Job growth in the state has
been double that in the nation as a whole; of the 2.1
million jobs created in the U.S. during the first 11
months of last year, one of every five new hires was in
California. The state produced more than $1.2 trillion in
output in 1999, making it the sixth-largest economy in the
world, slightly smaller than the economy of the United
Kingdom and a little bigger than that of Italy. The
state's economic output contributed about 12% of total
U.S. gross domestic product. New York, in second place,
had an 8.1% share of GDP.

But soaring energy costs are beginning to take a toll on
the Golden State, and low-end manufacturers are among the
first to see the change. ""It is forcing many of us to face
a shutdown,"" says Scott Edwards, president of the
Association of Textile Dyers, Printers and Finishers of
Southern California. His industry runs on gross profit
margins of 10% to 15%, hardly enough to handle the
fivefold increase in natural-gas costs that many operators
have witnessed.

Soaring energy prices also are hurting California's
agricultural industry. ""We can't pass along the costs of
production"" as some other industries do, says Heather
Flower, a spokeswoman for the Western Growers Association,
a group of 3,500 growers in California and Arizona. Some
are cutting back on plantings of broccoli, lettuce and
strawberries, among other crops, because of uncertainty
about costs.

Electricity prices already are on the march. The state's
largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison Co., received temporary rate increases
last week ranging from 9% for residential customers to 15%
for large companies. Some economists say the rises, if
they become permanent, could wipe out a large chunk of
per-capita-income gains and result in less consumer
spending.

On top of the energy problems, Hollywood is bracing for a
strike by the Writers Guild of America and the unions
representing film and television actors, whose contracts
are set to expire this year. The studios spent the end of
2000 jamming in production to cushion the impact of a
potential strike. The sector employs nearly 300,000 people
in the state.

While there seems little doubt that the troubles brewing
in California will prove painful, there are reasons to
believe the state can still avert an outright economic
contraction. Its economy is more diversified and resilient
than a decade ago, when national-defense cutbacks and an
overbuilt property market crippled the local economy. Back
then, jobs in the aerospace sector shrank by 70%, and
office-vacancy rates in major markets soared.

Also, despite all the attention being given to the state's
energy crisis, the fact is ""we're not a very
energy-intensive economy,"" says Ted Gibson, chief state
economist with California's department of finance. He
notes that the state ranks 48th among the 50 states in
per-capita energy consumption. And he adds that the $11
billion in deficit spending racked up by the two big
utilities amounts to less than 1% of state output. ""It's
not the kind of cost that will bring the state to its
knees,"" he says.

627,"Everyone,

Enron has just launched an effort to educate California businesses on the 
California energy crisis, engage them in the debate, and coordinate our 
efforts in working toward ""real solutions"".  A direct mail piece was sent out 
on Monday from Ken Lay.  The materials that were sent are attached below.  

There will be follow up with the businesses that we have targeted.  We also 
intend to make contact with non-business organizations in the coming weeks. 

PLEASE NOTE:  The letters reference a California website that we have set up 
for businesses to receive additional information.  DO NOT GO TO THIS SITE AS 
WE ARE TRACKING THE NUMBER OF HITS WE RECEIVE AND WE DON'T WANT A SKEWED 
NUMBER DUE TO ENRON EMPLOYEE HITS.

If you have questions, please feel free to call me at 3-9104.
Thanks!





We also enclosed Ken Lay's San Francisco Chronicle op-ed (March 1st), and the 
Wall Street Journal article on the economic impact of the energy crisis 
(March 8th)."
628,"Joe?Chris - this covers some of my new turf.  We have, I am told, a power 
project in Gaza that we are working on.  It is probably early days, but 
perhpas Mac mcClelland in Dubai can shed some light on whether we would want 
to get that project on the Secretary of Energy's radar screen.   mcs

629,"Steve:

I spoke with Sam Behrends, Adam Wenner (FERC attorneys) and Joanne Rutkowski 
(SEC attorney) about your question on a third quarter close.   On the FERC 
side, protests to the merger application are due on May 3.  We are expecting 
protests, but until we see the extent of the opposition, its hard to estimate 
the likelihood of a July order.  However, we all agree that based on the 
facts of the merger and the types of protests we expect to see, a July order 
is within the realm of possibility.  FERC just issued an order approving the 
PECO/ComEd merger earlier this week.  The order was issued 142 days after the 
merger application was filed.  If FERC does not find the opposition to the 
PGE/Sierra merger overwhelming, it could issue an order before FERC goes on 
August recess (this would also allow FERC to meet its 150 day target for 
acting on merger petitions).  

Even if a FERC order is issued by the end of July, we will still need SEC 
approval.  (The SEC will not issue its order until FERC has approved the 
merger.)  Joanne Rutkowski thinks that although a September order from the 
SEC is possible, it is not likely, due mainly to the fact that several other 
big merger proceedings (NSP, AEP, Energy East, ComEd) are in the queue ahead 
of the PGE/Sierra merger awaiting SEC approval.  

With regard to the Hart-Scott-Rodino filing with DOJ, DOJ approval is 
normally not a problem, but attorneys with DOJ have expressed some concern 
that the merged Sierra/PGE company could have potential market power in 
transmission going into southern California.  DOJ has submitted a request for 
information to Sierra and PGE, and we are working on the response to that 
request now.  Our attorneys and Sierra's attorneys do not think at this point 
that obtaining DOJ approval of the merger will be a problem, but until we 
receive final DOJ sign-off on the merger, DOJ review will continue to be an 
open issue.  We should have a better idea of whether DOJ is going to raise 
any significant problems with the merger within the next couple of months.

I see that Paul sent you a separate email on the status of the state 
proceedings.

I hope this is helpful.  Please call me if you have any questions.

"
630,"Steve, 

For our conference call on Monday, I thought it would be useful for you to 
have this.  The summary is pretty much the same, except that the shopping 
incentive for commercial customers increased by 5%, however, that is still 
not enough to make it work for us.

Under the stipulation, the dollars FE is to receive are not quantified and my 
sense is that FE probably got very close to what they asked for.  Their 
request was for $6.9 billion net of deferred taxes (the number they used 
publically); however, with the deferred taxes added in, this becomes $8.7 
billion.  The recovery period for the CTC is Dec. 31, 2006 for OE, June 30, 
2007 for TE and Dec. 31, 2008 for CEI subject to the usual caveats.  The 
total transition revenues on a net present value basis is $9.1 billion and in 
nominal dollars, $12.3 billion.

In calculating their transition costs, FE used a rate of return for the GTC 
of 15.38% for OE, 13.15% for CEI and 13.13% for TE.  For the RTC, FE used a 
rate of return of 14.59% for OE, 12.67% for CEI and 12.66% for TE.
Thus, I believe the recovery is overly generous.  It seems to me that it 
would be worth exploring a PECO-type solution here.  Under the settlement, it 
is highly unlikely that a competitive market will emerge in the next 8 years 
or that we will be able to compete.

The book-id itself can be any name as long it is a unique name. The -PRC or -IDX suffixes were added as a convinience so that the risk type can be identified by looking at the book-id. The book-type or risk-type code against the book-id in RisktRAC will define the risk type and the system does not depend on the name of the book-id to identify the risk type.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

652,"John and Louise -

Based on your meeting with Kevin and Dave earlier today, I understand you would like a breakdown of the expenditures expected to develop a Texas coal plant to the point that it can be monetized.

The below is my best estimate for developing the Brownsville site to get to the monetization point (permits in hand and EPC contract signed).  I expect to have both an EPC contract and permits in hand some time around Sep '02 if we start with the expenditures in mid July '01.  Expenditures will be incurred at the rate of approximately $350,000 per month for the next 12 months.  We can back out at any time with only prompt month plus one additional month committed.

Costs for a Florida site will be similar; however, expenditures will not start until we achieve site control.

My recommendation is to start fully developing the Brownsville, TX site with a plan to flip the site once we have a permit, as market conditions warrant.  I recommend holding off on significant expenditures in Florida until we get more comfortable with site control.

658,"I've spoken with Pushkar regarding the ECP interest rate hedges. There were two sets of hedges put in place. Notional value of $32.68mm executed 5/16/2000 and $350mm on 3/15/2001. I have asked Pushkar to research the cash flows he hedged to determine how those tranche sizes came about. 

The Fair Value of Enron's equity and sub debt (net of the $30mm Merlin piece) per the DASH of December 7, 2000 indicated a value at that time of $360mm. Additionally, the DASH assumed further gain in the base case of approximately $8mm suggesting there might have been $368mm of value to hedge. Because the generic five year Treasury yields also declined from 5.262% on Dec 7 (DASH date) to 4.508% by March 15 (closing/hedging date), the value of the El Paso fixed cash flow stream would have increased in value above $368mm (perhaps to the $380mm range - that's what I've asked Pushkar to check), it would seem to indicate that the original hedges were rolled into the subsequent hedges to represent the value of the entire transaction at final closing. In that case, the original Linden 6 hedges would not be open positions at all but rather a part of the hedging strategy that was required at closing per the executed DASH.

Pushkar has indicated he will look into his files to ascertain how the hedges were sized. Assuming the above accurately portrays what occurred, it would appear the transaction steps at execution followed the DASH requirements. I will followup as early as possible next week.

OK - here's the sort of thing I am thinking of (still needs Kal's magic).

I suspect you were thinking of a pop-up notice. Given that we aren't really showing anything on EnronOnline at the moment, I suggest we take down EnronOnline entirely and replace it with a splash page which says something like the following:


					COMING SOON

Enron is working with potential industry partners to assemble a new venture which will combine Enron's trading and market - making expertise with the financial strength and reliability of an A rated entity.

Upon formation of this new company, we anticipate that we will be able to announce the launch of a new trading platform for North American gas and power, providing services similar to those previously available on EnronOnline.

Please check back with this site for future updates on plans for the new trading platform.

666,"Hi Louise,

With the copy of the procedures that I gave you I think we have covered who can suspend George. However I am still trying to figure out who is responsible for determining when to shut it down. I was wondering if you know whether Greg Whalley is still going to be responsible for managing the product or has it been turned over to the crude group.

Also were you serious when you said you wanted the suspend trading button back. Thanks.

"
667,"I hope this isn't too late.  If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.

I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.  I'm thinking of something to the effect of:

Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.  For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active.

Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.

The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as:

'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.  The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.'

If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.

Enymex slowed by Access Internet launch

08/29/2001
Megawatt Daily
(c) Copyright 2001 Pasha Publications, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

  It looks to be another four to six months before NYMEX launches its
electronic trading platform enymex, designed to provide a neutral
trading platform for traditionally over-the-counter products. The delay
comes in part as NYMEX begins offering its after-hours Access electronic
trading system via the Internet next week.

  The introduction of Access to the Internet poses some new questions
for NYMEX, especially how it will integrate Access with enymex, NYMEX's
Nachamah Jacobovits explained. The two platforms will remain separate,
but the idea is to allow easy trading between the two, she noted.
  NYMEX had to delay an anticipated second-quarter launch for enymex
this year after canceling a contract with a software provider that was
developing the link between the order matching system and screen layout
for the new platform. The exchange has been working with the remaining
software vendors and staff to complete the platform.

  As it stands now, enymex would offer a variety of gas swap contracts
related to the Henry Hub and other pricing points, as well as crude oil,
heating oil and gasoline calendar swaps.

  Enymex promises to be a neutral, open trading platform without
counterparty credit risk, offering standardized basis products tied to
the exchange's most liquid benchmark products. Its development was first
announced in May 2000.                                             SGS

Savita is talking to Jay right now and if that goes OK, Savita is done as well.  I told Jay that I was doing this so there should not be any issues.  Jay told me he would absolutely support Savita as he did when Andy was in charge.  She is ready to support the deal until year end and help me hire and train the next wave of EOL folks as well as get Brad ready.

Richter is committed as well.  He feels the origination part is tactical and a short run project and wants to run the system like Andy used to.

Savita will get with me tomorrow first thing and I think seal it.  We all want to wait until next week when Pickering is here to make it public knowledge.

Have no idea if EGM knows any of this.

I talked with Martin Chavez at Kiodex and he confirmed as well.

I think the bigger issue is that other enterprises are starting to try to build businesses around their systems and operations.  I think we have a good head start with CommodityLogic and Kiodex but we have to run even faster now.

I spoke to Mark and he outlined 2 potential fixes to the spread dilemma.  We can leave it the way it is (with some clarifying changes to the descriptions) or we can ask either the gas or the power desk to completely change their products.  Neither one is a very elegant solution.  Jay and I are scheduling meetings with each of the desks over the next few weeks, and I would like to take that opportunity to diligence the issue in person with the traders.  In short, we're working on it.

681,"""Reasonable"" works for me - my interpretation is what Enron has done in the past (and many other companies do) including but not limited to the following:

- actual moving and related costs 
- sales commission on house
- a couple of moving trips
- temp housing for a month or two
- coverage on appraised value of house if can not sell quickly
- gross up to cover taxes, where appropriate

- Not looking to gain, just to remain whole

Met with them today and gave an overview of Operations.  All went well.   The CFO asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction.  I described the Operations Pricing Model that I implemented several years ago.  They were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow, and I mentioned that through the OPM we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow.  The CFO asked to get some information regarding OPM.  I have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts.  This is not currently included in the data room.   Do you want to review this before I pass it along to Andy Zipper to provide to the CFO?  


UBS:

Eddie Pittarelli (Head of Operations for UBS) called today to reconfirm the numbers of operations personnel slated for Newco.  The spreadsheets that you had forwarded to me Louise (through Amy Fitzpatrick on December 19) totaled 172 for Operations, which included 32 for Gas Logistics.  Eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where UBS would again discuss their level of interest.  He wanted to know if the Operations staff was still primarily in tact, and I confirmed that is the case.  Told him that the leads on Gas Risk, Gas Logistics, Power Risk, Settlements and Documentation were all here in place.  He said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight that he plans to be in Houston within the next few days.  FYI. "

The consensus which emerged from the meeting this morning is that the Power guys would like to have a full blown Master Agreement on EnronOnline instead of a simpler GTC.

686,"Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing.

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart.

Thanks

Louise

 "
687,"Here is my first cut at taking the existing budget numbers to a desk-level.  Here are the key assumptions behind my cost allocations:
Direct costs for each group went to that group.
Gas Ops was allocated to Houston gas.
Power Ops was allocated to East and West Power based on commercial headcount.
Most other costs were allocated to Gas, East Power, West Power, Canada, OOC based on commercial headcount.
There are a hundred ways you could do this exercise, I'm not saying that this is the right way, but at least I was able to break the costs down.

I then calculated an EBIT by desk, funded a bonus pool, paid bonuses to all the non-commercial people, and figured out what a bonus pool would look like by desk based on the proforma values.  I am not necessarily saying that this is the way that we should do it, but I think that it is one way to view the world upon which we can make whatever changes/adjustments we deem necessary.  Here are my initial conclusions / reactions:
The proforma produces bonuses for commercial employees equal to roughly 6% of their gross margin.
This number is high relative to the 1-2% we are used to, but considerably lower than the 8% to 12% that appears to be available in the market.
Our costs are way too high.  For every dollar of direct commercial expenses there are four dollars of allocations.  That just seems way out of hand.
This model sells with lower costs.  With current costs, I have a hard time convincing people in Portland that this looks good relative to people's alternatives.

I think that we need to have a lot of discussions next week on how this new organization would be managed.  I don't see why we couldn't debate, if not nail down, a bunch of things next week.  For example:
How do we allocate VAR to the best performing traders and the market that offers the best opportunity at the time?
Do we need to incent desk heads based on netco earnings while compensate traders based on desk earnings?
How will we carve up the bonus pool?  What are our choices?  What gets the VAR to the right places and properly incents teamwork?
How do we best manage costs?  How do we send appropriate cost signals for sunk costs?  For variable costs?
We need a very strong, professional, operations manager who is steeped in cost accounting, efficiency, quality control, and leadership.  There is a science to operations management that I haven't seen applied at Enron.  For example, what does it cost us to schedule a MW - average and marginal?  What does it cost us to run a book?  What does it cost us to settle transactions?
What package are we going to be able to offer to incent people to stay?  When can we start talking about it?  Who should we discuss this with?
What does our management team look like?  Is it three people?  Five people? Ten people?

I want to make this thing work.  My clear first choice for 2002 is to be on this team.  I want to be as contructive and helpful as possible in achieving this end.  I can't commit unequivically (sp?) until we sort out all of the numbers, I feel like I can sell this to the Portland team, and I know what comp looks like for me and the key people in Portland.  I feel like some adjustments to the proforma and a clear understanding of 2002 comp will probably get us there.

When do you want me in Houston (for a visit - not to move)?

As a follow up to our meeting last week with Colleen on the Ardmore facility, I had a conversation this morningwith Richard Sanders concerning the status of the settlement negotiations with Dynegy concerning Northern Natural Gas. I understand from Richard that part of the settlement will be an agreement that will allow Enron Corp to continue to lease the Ardmore facility as a data center. 

I just wanted to remind everyone that the lease also needs to allow Enron to provide space to NETCO for its hardware during a transition period until NETCO can relocate its hardware to a new data center. 	The lease also needs to make it clear that access to the Ardmore facility needs to be under Enron's control.

Similarily the software license that Enron will retain covering all the Enron developed software will also need to provide that Enron can use the covered software to provide services to third parties such as AEP, Bridgeline and Northern Natural Gas.	If anyone has any questions, please give me a call.

707,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

I just wanted to send you a quick note with the hope that you might have a chance to read your e-mail. It seemed more awkward to me to try and catch you in person giving the frenetic pace and fluidity of our situation.

Basically all I want to tell you is that I'm here to help in this process, and encourage you to let me know if there is anything else in particular I can help on. I have spoken and offered the same directly to Miller, Calger and Duran. I'm not telling folks this out of lack of current work flow. As I think you know, the development group is in the middle of several active transactions that we expect to close in the near term, and we remain keenly focused on making these deals happen (as evidenced by the $1.375 million Doyle insurance settlement finalized today). 

I'm approaching you and others specifically because I have 2 years of Chapter 11 bankruptcy experience. Prior to me joining Enron in May of 1998, I was with Kenetech Corporation (a 1,200 employee publicly traded IPP). In 1996 (after having worked as an Originator at Kenetech since 1990), Kenetech filed for Chapter 11. As part of the Chapter 11 process, I was one of 6 senior commercial employees retained by the Company to be responsible for liquidating the Company's assets. As such, I am very familiar with the Chapter 11 process, and how deals get done in this context. Enron is obviously of a far greater magnitude, but I believe the basic skills and experience are directly applicable.

Again, as we go through this process, I just wanted to make you aware of my experience in this area, and let you know that I stand ready, willing and eager to take on additional tasks.

With respect to our current deal flow, I also wanted to let you know we are working on the following which I will get to you by Friday (or earlier if need be):

1. Transaction list, status, and valuation;
2. Site bank summary and exit / monetization strategy;
3. Projected site bank maintenance budget.

I will, of course, also provide this information to Miller, Calger and Duran.

Best regards,

Ben"

712,"Lousie,

I would be grateful if you could review the transaction below, which will require your approval.   As outlined below the client 'Borealis'  wishes to change the terms of the contract given our current situation.  RAC is comfortable with the changes, as it will result in a significant saving in storage costs and allow the LPG trader to flatten his book. Further, whilst there maybe the potential of MTM movement between the $180 purchase price from Borealis and the subsequent sale (index related price) back to the counterpart, this will be netted out.  RAC has significant risk appetite for this counterpart, which is a sound credit, rated E5.  The only issue is whether Houston has sufficient resources or are willing to pay the storage costs early, which could range between $1,200,000-?1,400,000.  If this is feasible I will recommend that we negotiate a discount of $15 on storage costs (saving $600,000) as opposed to $10.

719,"Our current plan on EA Operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10%.  I will get with you on Tuesday morning to review the names, but I feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys, as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders.  Our current estimate on cost reductions for EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago.  

Beth Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow.   We are in agreement, as Bob Hall has worked with Beth's team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM Enhancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other that escapes me at the moment).  Beth and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially-driven IT projects.

722,"From our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the business, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels), our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:

This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather positions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  

Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.

725,"I think we urgently (next 2 days) need to have a meeting to discuss where we allocate capital and risk. Counterparties are very nervous and many are not extending us credit so we are having to prepay extensively to do business, both in the US and UK. I have two suggestions:

-allocate to each business a fraction of our available liquidity
or
-appoint someone to make the call when a large chunk of cash is needed.

For example, EGM wants to send out $200- $300 million for sixty days to buy physical to cover an option with Koch. 

We do not have infinite liquidity and we need to address it fast. I will try to set up a meeting tomorrow.

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created. Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders. 
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months.
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share. 
During the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more than 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr. Fastow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper. 
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while ""we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well."" Mr. Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs. 
Mr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. But neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow-related partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts and others. Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was ""very concerned about the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about."" He added ""we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy."" 
Internal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to Enron SEC filings. 
During the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime Enron fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the company's often opaque financial reports. ""There's the appearance you are hiding something,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. ""You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board."" 
Mr. Lay responded, ""We're trying to be as transparent as we can.""

Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts
By FLOYD NORRIS

c. 2001 New York Times Company

Enron has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities. 
In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.
But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it. 
The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000. 
Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said. 
After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.'' 
Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.'' 
Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. 
Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares. 
Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But let's move on to the next question.'' 
Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. 
Mr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises. 
The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct. 
After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company ''will look into providing'' such statements.

Options Report
Surge in Optimism Prompts Straddles In Enron and Cisco
By Kopin Tan
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Bullish calls traded heavily early as investors, encouraged by the ability of stocks to shrug off anthrax scares, bought calls to replace stock holdings and to ride any rallies. 
At one point, the ratio of equity calls traded to puts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange fell to 0.28, compared with 0.68 Friday and Monday's three-month closing low of 0.42.
The surge of optimism -- also evident in the CBOE market-volatility index, or VIX -- prompted traders to begin covering the downside, just as the widely watched stock indexes began to retreat. Contrarians believe the CBOE equity put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the session's end, the ratio was at 0.49. 
Buyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet switching equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at Letco, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands of January 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while 6,861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange. 
The implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as the energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the Houston company. 
The volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer rich premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at Miller Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would earn an investor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock. 
To be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire. Investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock, while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range.

Lay tries to assure Enron investors 
Company's credibility questioned 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron had safeguards in place to protect shareholder interests while its chief financial officer ran two investment partnerships that did business with Enron, the company's chief executive officer said Tuesday. 
The Houston-based energy trader has been caught in a storm of criticism over Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's former role with two partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with Enron. 
Enron disclosed Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an ""informal inquiry"" into transactions between Enron and the two partnerships. 
It declined to say if the SEC is looking into other transactions. 
After the disclosure, Enron's stock fell almost 21 percent Monday. Tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79. 
The news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Street that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its performance. 
Tuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for investors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns. 
It remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of questions during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard. 
""I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions,"" he said. 
Lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry. 
He did say Enron was aware an ""inherent conflict of interest"" would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron. 
In response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously followed, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised. 
""There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron,"" he said, adding that Enron wasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enron's best interest. 
Lay and Enron's board continue to have the ""highest faith and confidence"" in Fastow, he added. 
Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street. 
Enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships. 
It took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion as a result. 
During the call Enron executives also addressed other issues. 
They stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles, Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the investments. 
If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who follows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received some new information about Enron's lines of credit. 
""I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call,"" he said.

Enron should know plenty about bandwidth.
Through Enron Broadband Services, the giant energy company boasts about ""developing an open and efficient market for bandwidth that provides liquidity, reliability, price transparency and guaranteed service levels"". 
But there were no guarantees about service levels yesterday, when Enron held a conference call to ""address investor concerns"" about its financial dealings. 
Despite the bandwidth expertise, the call - the first time that Andrew Fastow, chief financial officer, has faced questions about the transactions from analysts - was available to just 300 lucky telephone diallers. A live webcast of the call was accessible on Enron's website, but without the chance to grill Enron brass. 
Those investors and journalists who did make it through (some waited 20 minutes for their place at the party; others found their lines dropped mid-stream) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives. An analyst chided for his part in lowering the company's share price was told by Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, that his question quota was up and it was time to move on.

USA: Enron mulls ways to cover portfolio shortfalls-WSJ.

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. Treasurer Ben Glisan said the company thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment vehicles it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Wednesday. 
Enron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby diluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.
The report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due during the next 20 months. The entities are known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc, the report said. 
According to the report, Glisan said assets from those entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Enron is selling other assets, the report said. According to the newspaper, proceeds from those sales could go toward repaying the notes, which are ultimately guaranteed by Enron. 
Glisan, according to the report, said it looks like asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Glisan said, according to the report. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" 
According to the report, Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. 
Enron held a conference call on Tuesday, seeking to assuage investor concerns after U.S. regulators said they were looking into transactions involving the company's chief financial officer and its stock shed more than $10 billion in value over the past week. 
Enron said on the call it can tap $3.35 billion from a credit line, suggesting it has enough liquidity to operate its core trading and marketing business, which can experience wide swings in cash flow, depending on commodity prices and market hedges.

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron (ENE) shares, diluting the position of current shareholders.
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock.

Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750-million loan, ensuring access to credit if the beleaguered company is cut off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter. 
Enron's shares and bonds plunged after the firm said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its finances.
The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75% this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends on a $3-billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations. 
As a second-tier commercial paper borrower, any ratings drop may cut off Enron from the commercial paper market and raise costs of short-term debt. 
Enron shares dropped 86 cents to close at $19.79 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars over the next 18 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, treasurer Ben Glisan said. The possible shortfall related to about $3.2-billion (U.S.) in notes that related entities sold to investors since 1999, he said. Proceeds from those notes were invested in various Enron assets. Mr. Glisan said those notes come due over the next 18 months and Enron still hopes to sell enough assets to fully repay the notes. However, making up any shortfall with funds raised by selling stock has become more expensive as Enron's share price has plunged. Over the past week, shares of the energy trading giant have fallen more than 40 per cent.

Abreast of the Market
Everest Re, St. Paul and Providian Drop, but Markets Stay Resilient
By Robert O'Brien
Dow Jones Newswires

10/24/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Stocks ended only slightly lower as the recently resilient market largely withstood the effects of dismal corporate profit statements. 
Shares of drug maker Pharmacia fell $4.37, or 13%, to $38.39, after the company issued third-quarter results that topped Wall Street's forecasts, but also issued 2002 profit projections that left some analysts disappointed.
In fact, several drug companies saw their stock prices fall as investors responded to their quarterly profit statements. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products lost 1.40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, to 38.17. 
Shares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to 69.50, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25. 
Power utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after its third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from several analysts. 
Nevertheless, even with the grim earnings outlook, investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel. 
""Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market,"" Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason, said. ""Their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly, which is eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it."" 
Some seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently. For many mutual funds, for example, their fiscal year concludes at the end of October. Some are doing what is called window dressing -- buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio -- while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market. 
Whatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen, and modest moves when they have declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ran up 172.92 points Monday, declined 36.95 points yesterday, a loss of 0.39%, to 9340.08. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3.64 points, or 0.21%, to 1704.44. Volume levels showed some improvement over Monday's rather sluggish pace. 
Investors haven't completely rolled over. In a handful of the situations in which their ire has been raised, they have lashed those stocks repeatedly. Shares of SBC Communications, one of Monday's disappointments, got punished again, falling 2.62, or 6.3%, to 38.78, and fell back in range of a 52-week low of 38.20, set June 26. 
Consumer lender Providian Financial got sent to a fresh 52-week low, off 41 cents, or 8.3%, to 4.55. Enron, which has fallen on concerns about conflicts of interest in dealings among the company, a power marketer, and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, dropped an additional 86 cents, or 4.2%, to 19.79, hitting a 52-week low intraday. 
There were some winning profit statements. Shares of CSX, for example, rose 2.45, or 7.5%, to 35.19, after the Richmond, Va., rail-freight concern reported third-quarter earnings that, while they fell short of year-ago performance, nevertheless managed to top Wall Street's forecasts. 
Vitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated circuits used in high-bandwidth communications networks, added 43 cents, or 4.5%, to 9.99, even though the company's losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected. 
NetIQ (Nasdaq) dropped 4.23, or 14%, to 26.17, even though the Santa Clara, Calif., developer of networking software posted fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Chartered Semiconductor (Nasdaq) advanced 40 cents, or 2.1%, to 19.10. The Singapore chip foundry reported third-quarter results that showed a loss for the period, but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected. 
Shares of several cable-television operators moved higher. Charter Communications added 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.62, Comcast gained 40 cents, or 1.1%, to 36.82, and Cox Communications rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.15. Thomas Weisel Partners said that cable operators should benefit from SBC Communications' decision, revealed Monday with its quarterly results, to scale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering. 
EarthLink (Nasdaq) slid 2.51, or 14%, to 14.85. The Atlanta Internet service provider issued stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, but also signaled that its customer growth had slowed. 
AT&T Wireless increased 1.26, or 9.7%, to 14.20. The Redmond, Wash., provider of wireless communications services reported third-quarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Several steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U.S. Trade Commission, which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports; the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 28 cents, or 1.9%, to 15.02, Nucor rose 1.05, or 2.5%, to 42.87, and AK Steel improved 41 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.31. 
McKesson advanced 1.56, or 4.2%, to 38.95. The San Francisco drug distributor and health-care information technology provider posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results. 
Watson Pharmaceuticals fell 3.05, or 6%, to 48.11. UBS Warburg reduced its rating on the Corona, Calif., drug maker, and lowered its earnings projections for the company. 
Furniture Brands dropped 2.04, or 8.9%, to 20.96. UBS Warburg cut its rating on the St. Louis furniture manufacturer, saying it believes the company has lost market share to rival manufacturers.

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -- Following Enron Corp. U.S. energy company AES Corp. has turned to the Indian prime minister for help in settling its grievances with a state government. 
In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES Corp.'s President Dennis W. Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India is being tested by the government of eastern Orissa state.
A copy of the letter, dated Oct. 1, was made available to the Associated Press. 
AES operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49% of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. 
AES and Enron are the only major American power companies to make big investments in India since the government allowed foreign investment in the sector in the early 1990s. 
In his letter, Mr. Bakke drew Mr. Vajpayee's attention to the ""expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation . . . and direct interference with day-to-day management"" by the state government and its agencies.

UK: LNG delays could spawn shipping crisis - analysts.
By Pete Harrison

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The transport chain supporting the global LNG industry will be finely poised in coming years between profitability and a crisis of oversupply if projects miss their deadlines, shipping analysts warn. 
More LNG tankers than ever before are being constructed in the shipyards of the Far East, many of them ordered speculatively against anticipated demand, which might emerge later than scheduled.
""The issue is timing,"" Jarle Sjo, shipping equity analyst at Oslo-based investment bank First Securities told Reuters. 
""Historically, LNG projects have been delayed - you can estimate at about six months - and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term,"" he added. 
The world fleet of LNG tankers currently numbers 123, but will have swollen by about 37 percent by the end of 2004, according to shipping database Fairplay. 
Gas industry analysts expect some LNG projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn, excess capacity at existing plants in Asia and a sharp fall in U.S. natural gas prices this year. 
Svein Erik Amundsen, Managing Director of Norwegian shipping group Bergesen, said that a sustained economic downturn could have ""consequences."" 
""I wouldn't be surprised by project delays,"" he told Reuters. ""This could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment."" 
""I think you can say we're still optimistic, but more cautiously optimistic than before,"" he added. Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of which have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas. 
STOP AND THINK 
The world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, historically bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and consider the problem. 
Golar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under construction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment. 
""There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered,"" Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters, ""The only risk is things might be delayed."" 
Stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it was also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of them. 
Golar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more traditional approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance. 
""We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under offer for the (Qatari) RasGas tender,"" Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told Reuters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron. 
He said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agreements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders. 
""It's a good time to wait,"" said Saverys.

INDIA PRESS:British Gas Seeks ONGC Deal For Field Control

10/24/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- British Gas has offered India's Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) equity in its exploration acreage in Brazil and a cash settlement in lieu of operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields, the Economic Times reported Wednesday. 
ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) are claiming operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields following Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd.'s 30% stake sale to BG, according to the report.
State-owned ONGC holds a 40% stake in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields and Reliance owns 30%. 
The Enron Oil & Gas stake sale will fall through if BG isn't given the operatorship of the oil fields, Nigel Shaw, vice president of BG India said in the report. 
Shaw said the equity partners are in discussions on the issue of operatorship, the report said. 
British Gas is a unit of BG Group PLC (BRG). Enron Oil & Gas is a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE).

"
745,"John:

I spoke with Tim yesterday evening regarding your feedback to the 
compensation proposal I sent last week. Before our conversation this morning 
I wanted to give you a chance to review some of thoughts I have which might 
help keep our discussion more focused. 

First, I think we've both been at Enron about the same amount of time and 
probably share similar experiences about contracts and compensation at Enron. 
In general, my experience is that there has never been any open information 
by management about any overall compensation structures, equity plans, 
compatability between ENA groups or other Enron companies. Just as we all 
have to create our own path at Enron we generally must do our own research 
and draw our own conclusions about compensation within and outside Enron. In 
several cases we have lost people we are trying to contract as a result of 
the contracting process! In my opionion, this is mostly because of the lack 
of communication of any ""overall compensation plan"" which drives people to 
the market to make an evaluation which they otherwise may not be inclined to 
do if information were available. Among the many ENA managers I have worked 
with none has ever explained any such ""plan"". Tim has indicated that there is 
some sort of overall compensation structure plan that you and Dave Delainey 
are trying to adhere to. I would appreciate some discussion about this as it 
may relieve some of the concerns we all end up having about signing a 
contract without being 100% satisfied with the minimum amounts in the 
contract (primarily because we've experienced the verbal commitment which is 
forgotten or lost in the latest management shuffle). 

Second, Tim indicated some concern about locking in certain minimum overall 
compensation levels and that ""if a person were to have a bad year there may 
be no room for bonus"". I think this is a real concern particularly when we 
consider a new trader from outside the company. In my case, while I currently 
don't have a specific book that gets marked each day, I think there is a 
clear record over the past seven years of significant value to ENA's west 
power business. This value comes in several forms: value above the 
offer/below the bid, market information driving both short and long-term 
value into our books, developing new markets and products for ENA, extending 
my market knowledge and deal structuring capabilities on a continuous basis 
each day to other origination/strucuturing/mid-market/real time groups, 
building a no-risk/high value Services business, and providing leadership to 
employees about their role at Enron or Enron's role in the market. All of 
these efforts are focused on adding mark-to-market value to ENA in more ways 
than any single, specific book can measure. I am certain that I will continue 
to add value in these ways and have little concern about this ""bad year"" 
scenario.

Finally, I am trying to make sense of the proposed compensation that Tim has 
relayed to me. If I understand it correctly my cash compensation pay would 
change from $206k ($130 base /$56 COLA /$50 retention) over the past three 
years as a Director to a base pay of $170k as a Vice President with higher 
expections and increasing responsibilities. The equity plan that is currently 
available to Vice Presidents and above would be locked in at values of 
$175/$125. This one is a little hard for me to evaluate as it is new in its 
current form (I have been a participant in prior years of similar equity 
plans which have ranged in initial from $10k-$50k as a Director). Bonus would 
be determined annually, I assume under similar process as past years. The 
trouble I am having is evaluating a significant decrease in cash compensation 
after being promoted and locking in a known (versus unknown) value in an 
equity plan for which I presumably am already a participant in and for which 
there is little other plan information available to evaluate.  I would 
appreciate your thoughts on this in relation to any overall compensation 
""plan"".

I'll look forward to our discussion.

Greg"
746,"Michael -

Are these changes in the forward volumes (unrealized losses).  Can you explain the reason for these adjustments?  How much more exists that we need to address?

Thanks,

"
747,"Dear Mr. Lavorato,

I received your contact details from Dave Delainey and he suggested that we
speak regarding this initiative. I am compiling a report entitled The Impact
of Competition with PricewaterhouseCoopers Energy Practice that examines
business solutions within the utilities sector. Essentially, the report is
designed to inform senior executives with energy management responsibility
throughout the private sector on how to enhance their effectiveness. The
project is in its second phase and you can see round one on the associated
web-site, www.utilitiesproject.com.

I would like to schedule a call with you, so we can speak about this
initiative and your potential involvement. Thank you for your time and I
look forward to hearing from you.


Kind regards,

748,"Executive Summary
Edison's MOU Condemned at this Friday's CPUC Meeting
The Idle Plan Z=20
Angelides Hides State Budget Concerns=20
House Committee to Vote on Energy Relief

Edison's MOU Doubtful
The unusually calm settling over the California legislature about SoCal Edi=
son's potential bankruptcy has finally affected the relentlessly optimistic=
 investment bank analysts and other company shareholders.  We have reported=
 that through all plans from B-Z, there is not a solid plan to save this co=
mpany and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions may co=
me to fruition.

Over the last few days, Edison executives have begun pointing hard at the C=
PUC meeting this Friday as a make-or-break event for the company.  The is b=
ecause after the meeting, Davis's MOU plan to buy SoCal's grid will have no=
 chance of preventing a potential bankruptcy.  This plan is essentially dea=
d although Governor Daivs has yet to say this in a press releases.  The fin=
al nail will happen after the CPUC adjourns its Friday meeting without voti=
ng on several necessary MOU provisions.  Unless the CPUC makes a last minut=
e, emergency - amendment to their agenda,  the deal will be dead (despite S=
oCal's support for letting the deal stand past its deadline).  Sources indi=
cate that CPUC President Loretta Lynch holds reservations on the MOU and co=
ntinues to distance herself from Davis. =20

Attempting to influence policy making, Edison executives have spent the las=
t few investor phone conferences warning that June 8 would see substantiall=
y increased risks for a creditor-induced bankruptcy if the Davis plan dies =
at CPUC.  This is interesting, since no one else seems to have been focused=
 on the date until Edison began mentioning it late last week.  However, the=
re is no more or less threat of bankruptcy than there is now or will be in =
two weeks.   As reported several times earlier, most everyone had given up =
on the MOU long before this Friday's CPUC meeting.

Plan Z Shows Little Progress
Meanwhile, the unhurried pace toward a Plan Z that we reported last Friday,=
 has gained little progress.  Legislators continue to pin-point a plan that=
 will secure re-election votes and at the same time, weigh the need for rat=
e hikes for California's corporate and home electricity users.  As they has=
h it out, the state is spending even more on electricity purchases.  In spi=
te of better than expected levels of conservation, the state's electricity =
expenditures over the last month rose to an average of $79M/day. The recent=
 rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into questio=
n the reassuring Angelides scenario for California's budget prospects later=
 this year.

The California Budget Crunch
Even more worrisome than a idle Plan Z is increasing evidence that last mon=
th's conference call with State Treasurer Angelides was a little misleading=
. During that conference call Angelides claimed that State Comptroller Conn=
ell and many in the financial committee had the numbers wrong.  Angelides a=
rgued that $7.2B already spent to buy power since January was really the to=
tal amount of authorized spending through late August.  In fact, he said on=
ly $4.3B of that had been ""spent.""  Sources now indicate that  Angelides wa=
s technically correct if you use ""spent"" to mean only the amount of money f=
or which checks had been written.  This is different than the amount of mon=
ey California had already promised to energy suppliers who had already supp=
lied energy to the state.  In fact, when Angelides was speaking the state h=
ad in fact already promised to pay $7B for energy it had already consumed (=
the total committed has topped $8B.)  By the time the state gets its ""power=
 bonds"" auctioned in August, they will have already spent all $12B and be b=
ack to dipping into the General Fund.   The idea of RANs being auctioned be=
fore the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general fund does=
n't make it to August.=20

The nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the =
painful process that the legislature is undertaking now - another round of =
huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance.  Then the hope is =
that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings wh=
olesale rates down and the debts can be repaid.   The only near term path t=
o bringing generating assets on line immediately is the 3,500 MW from QF pl=
ants which are off line because of cash flow problems.  Settling their need=
s is wrapped up in settling the PG&E and Edison trade creditor issues, whic=
h makes the legislature's leisurely approach to the rate hike/haircut situa=
tion all the more troublesome.

Energy Relief
The House Energy & Commerce Committee is scheduled to vote on H.R. 1647 (th=
e Emergency Electricity Relief Act) tomorrow at 10:00 am.  The bill which w=
as twice postponed and does not include any provisions on price caps, but d=
uring the course of the mark-up, sources indicate that it is possible, even=
 likely, that a Democrat could offer a price cap amendment.  Rep. Waxman (D=
-CA) offered a price cap amendment at an earlier mark-up of the bill at the=
 subcommittee level.  The Waxman amendment was rejected along party lines (=
all Republicans and 2 Democrats voted nay).  Sources inside Joe Barton's of=
fice report that staff and members have been meeting to work out a compromi=
se on the price cap issue, but nothing has been resolved. As of this aftern=
oon, those discussions have been terminated in favor of an open discourse i=
n the Committee tomorrow.  Since an agreement was not reached, compromise l=
anguage is not expected to be offered as an amendment tomorrow.  If it is, =
it would not be something that leaders on the Republican and Democrat sides=
 have crafted together and therefore would not likely pass.  Sources indica=
te that the committee does expect Waxman, and possibly others to offer pric=
e cap language, but it is not expected to pass.

KVAERNER WINS BALAL AWARD
Tehran - Kvaerner Singapore, part of the Anglo-Norwegian group, has been
appointed detailed engineering contractor for the offshore production
platform in the Balal oil field, being developed by TotalFinaElf. The award
follows Iranian Offshore Engineering and Construction (OIEC) and Singapore's
SembCorp winning the $60m contract for installation of the platform to
process 40,000bbl/d of oil and 14mcfd of associated gas.
The Anglo-Norwegian group was brought in by NIOC subsidiary Petro Pars in
April to manage the first phase development of South Pars gas field. In a
separate development, OIEC and Petro Iran are reported to be looking for a
foreign partner to take a 30% stake in the $850m Salman offshore project,
which the two Iranian companies won in October on a buy-back basis. The
Salman contract, tendered in 1998, requires the rebuilding of war-damaged
facilities and upgrading production at the field by 45,000 bbl/d to 130,000
bbl/d as well as developing an associated gas structure. http://www.irna.com


OPEC TO SUSPEND 20-DAY MECHANISM UNTIL JANUARY
Vienna - OPEC exporters have rejected calls from consuming nations for
further extra crude supplies that would have helped ease stubbornly high
world oil prices and cut fuel bills this winter. It appears, as the
Ministers meet in Austria this month, that OPEC will not be adding further
increases to world supplies despite oil prices remaining outside its
automatic 20-day production increase mechanism, set at $22-28/bbl. 'There
will be no increases this year under any circumstances,' Indonesian Oil
Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro told awaiting reporters after a two-hour
meeting ahead of the formal ratification of the decision.
http://www.opec.org/


SUDAN SIGN EXPLORATION AGREEMENT
Khartoum - Sudan has signed an oil exploration agreement with several local
and international companies for an area in central Sudan, the
government-owned Al-Anbaa newspaper reported on Sunday. 'Sudan has signed a
production agreement...covering prospecting, development and transportation
of oil with Gulf oil companies, the Chinese National Petroleum Corp, Al Than
and Sudapet,' the daily said.
Al-Anbaa said the agreement covered a 75sq.km area on the western bank of
the White Nile, south of the town of Rabak, about 275km south of Khartoum.
The Gulf companies hold a 46% stake in the investment, the Chinese company
has 23%, Al Than also has 23% and Sudapet holds 8%.
Sudan, which produces about 185,000 barrels per day of crude oil, began
crude exports in August 1999. It had previously been importing oil and oil
products for about $300m a year, eating up most of its export earnings. It
has also been reported this week that Talisman Energy are to step up their
exploration efforts in the country, despite opposition from humanitarian
groups.


SHELL INK EGYPTIAN GTL AGREEMENT
Cairo - Royal Dutch/Shell Group confirmed this week that they are to invest
$1.7bn in an Egyptian gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant that could lead the country
to use domestic gas reserves to satisfy its entire oil products market for
more than 50 years.
Egypt is currently an importer of oil products. The oil giant agreed to
initial terms on the deal early in October. Shell said it has now signed a
development protocol with Egyptian General Petroleum for a
75,000-barrel-per-day GTL conversion plant to convert natural gas into
synthetic fuels. Crucially the project is now said to have the backing of
Egyptian Petroleum Minister Sameh Fahmy. Production could be in place by
late 2005, while a plant at the same site producing liquefied natural gas
(LNG) could be up and running earlier, by mid-2004.

First of all HAPPY THANKSGIVING.  We Talked about you and how improtant our
family is on several occasions during the last few days. Hope your
Thanksgiving was as wonderful as ours. Jon Christopher, Mike, Nina, and
Elizabeth were here ( Columbia) for Thanksgiving. As usual, we talked, ate,
and enjoyed each other. It has become a family tradition to go to
Shakespeares Pizza, Ernies (ERNWAS) Steakhouse, and Booches (Hamburgers)
everytime any family member comes. Nina cooked some Russian quisine. The
weather was fairly decent for Missouri Thanksgiving (dry, 30 - 50 F).
Elizabeth saw Rugrats in Paris. Dalmations , and went to the parks. We
stayed behind and did other things including watching ""Hurricane"", a very
powerful movie.  Today we have been taking care of all those errands and
routines that are necessary after a weekend of company. We had a good time.


I talked to Ruby last evening. She has probably telephoned both of you by
now. She is sending some cookies to all of us, mostly using Mother's
recipes. How thankful I am to still have her.  And she seems to be in good
health. She is always so positive. She says that the second week in August
is probably the best weekend for the family reunion at our place in Crane
next year.  That would be August 11. How would that be for the two of you?
It would be fine with us. If you are in agreement I will send out the
invitations soon. If not, let me know so I can change it as you are two
important people for us and for the whole family.

We will be going to Thailand on February 5 and returning on March 4. I will
give you all numbers etc where we can be reached. We will have an apartment
in Bangkok but will be all over the Country. Karl and Ila Kruse will be with
us for two weeks. We are really looking forward to it.

Ken and Linda, we really enjoyed seeing you in Columbia. As usual you were
at your  best.

Sharon, We are having our usual big Christmas party on December 23. Any
chance you would be coming to Columbia? We would sure love to have you if
you
 can.

GE's Jeffrey R. Immelt=20
His Focus On The Customer Boosted Him To The Top=20
By Patrick Seitz
Investor's Business Daily
Jeffrey R. Immelt, the man chosen to succeed the legendary Jack Welch as=20
chief executive of General Electric Co., knows there's just one person=20
keeping him in business: the customer. And that customer is the person Imme=
lt=20
goes all-out to please.
Immelt, 44, was plucked from the company's fast-growing GE Medical Systems=
=20
business, where he had served as president and chief executive since 1997.=
=20
The $7 billion unit, based in Waukesha, Wis., is a world leader in medical=
=20
diagnostic technology and information systems.
Immelt attributes much of his success to his laserlike focus on sales.
""I love working with customers. . . . Sales has really influenced everythin=
g=20
I do. It has instilled in me the important traits of operating with a sense=
=20
of urgency and listening to people,"" Immelt said.
Immelt on Monday was named president and chairman-elect of GE. He will=20
succeed John F. ""Jack"" Welch Jr., GE's chairman and CEO, when Welch retires=
=20
at the end of 2001.
When Immelt landed at GE Medical Systems in 1997, he quickly showed a knack=
=20
for squeezing growth from a unit known for sluggish sales. Last year, its=
=20
revenue jumped 23% to $6 billion.
Customers credit Immelt with going way beyond sales. When Chicago's=20
Northwestern Memorial Hospital expanded its scanning services last year,=20
Immelt spent hours helping to manage its work flow.
""That's the kind of collaboration that we find unusual,"" Northwestern=20
Memorial CEO Gary Mecklenburg told Business Week.
Immelt has proven himself both by turning around troubled GE divisions and=
=20
extracting better performance from thriving units.
Immelt knows how important it is to set the pace, not follow it. To keep GE=
=20
Medical flourishing, he's pushed the unit to expand acquisitions and new=20
product offerings. The division's product line ranges from ultrasound devic=
es=20
used in doctors' offices to multimillion-dollar CT and MRI scanners.
In his earlier work in GE's Plastics division, Immelt stood out by persuadi=
ng=20
hard-boiled carmakers to substitute plastics for metal on some parts.
As vice president of consumer service for GE's Appliances division, Immelt=
=20
deftly handled the fallout from a recall of refrigerator compressors. To ke=
ep=20
workers' morale pumped up during the recall, Immelt would often climb up on=
 a=20
forklift in GE's Louisville, Ky., plant and pass out words of encouragement=
=20
and praise. He took time to speak with employees during such sessions,=20
listening carefully to their ideas and concerns.
Immelt believes that open, fast communication with workers is crucial. Not =
a=20
table-thumper, he meets with employees =01) sometimes hundreds at a time =
=01) to=20
discuss where GE Medical is going. Colleagues say he works at=20
consensus-building, urging others to understand different points of view.
After returning from corporate meetings, Immelt distills the latest GE=20
thinking on videotape, and copies are sent to offices around the world.
Understanding that seeing someone face to face helps foster stronger=20
relationships, Immelt also travels often to meet employees and customers.=
=20
Constant contact keeps a company united, Immelt believes. So he updates the=
=20
company's employees once a week via e-mail on the latest developments =01) =
new=20
business, lost sales opportunities and other nuggets about company=20
initiatives. E-mail is sent in five languages, and at times up to a dozen,=
=20
according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
Immelt was one of three GE executives who analysts considered possible=20
successors to Welch. Welch, 65, has been at the helm of the Fairfield,=20
Conn.-based finance, industrial and broadcasting powerhouse for the past tw=
o=20
decades.=20
""Jeff Immelt is a natural leader, and ideally suited to lead GE for many=20
years,"" Welch said. ""He brings a keen strategic intellect, a cutting-edge=
=20
technological background, strong leadership characteristics and a unique se=
t=20
of team-building skills.""
Knowing that preparation is key to long-term success, Immelt has long been=
=20
preparing himself, says Charles M. Lillis, a former GE executive who hired=
=20
Immelt in 1982.
""Starting in high school, (in) everything he did he was a leader,"" Lillis=
=20
told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""He played football. He was a student=
=20
leader. He went to Procter & Gamble after college and he did a great job in=
=20
sales. He also had the right balance of self-confidence and awareness that =
he=20
did not know everything.""
Immelt has strong marketing skills and helped create the GE slogan, ""We bri=
ng=20

Analysts and friends say the 6-foot, 4-inch Immelt possesses not only a=20

Immelt has a good sense of humor and the ability to present himself well to=

Despite the fun and games, his teammates could see Immelt's drive. ""When th=

Immelt studied just as hard as he played. He graduated cum laude with his=

"
774,"Hi, Ken,

Nice to see you again this morning in the lobby.  It's always a pleasure to 
enjoy your courtesy.  

Three years ago, you helped me get into Enron.  I am still immensely 
grateful.  It has been a fabulous experience.  Now, Azurix is releasing me;  
my last day is 31 DEC 2000.  I'm looking for a new position at Enron.  
Barring that, I take a standard severance package on 01 JAN 2001 and go 
overboard.  I'm taking the typical aggressive Enron approach to networking, 
so if you are aware of something, I'd appreciate knowing.  I'll be over to 
see Stan Horton this afternoon at 16:00.  

I've continued to hone my skills, and provide leadership and creativity in 
difficult circumstances.  
I know Enron is changing.  I'm willing to change (and learn!) with it.  
There's a lot I can do for Enron.  I'd just like to have a shot at it.  

Hope the holidays are joyous and safe for you and Linda and your entire 
family.

Best regards,

J. Paul

776,"I wanted to provide you an update on where we stand related to several recent 
contribution requests.

Tom Delay's Request -- We did fulfill the $10,000 request that came to us 
from Tom and Christine Delay for the Fort Bend Child Advocates.  In addition, 
we've arranged with Heather for your family's foundation to match Enron's 
gift.  I spoke directly with Christine Delay several times and they are very 
appreciative of the gifts and our efforts to correct the initial oversight.

YMCA --  I've had multiple conversations with Heather about a combined 
Enron/Lay Family contribution to the YMCA.  According to Heather, you and 
Linda have agreed to contribute $500,000 and ask that Enron match.  We are, 
of course, willing to do that.  I am scheduling a meeting with Bill Phillips 
of the YMCA to discuss the gift.  We will be talking to him about naming 
opportunities as well as the YMCA's consideration of extending services to 
Enron employees at the downtown YMCA, as well as outlying facilities.  (FYI:  
The downtown YMCA recently chose to cancel the agreement we'd had with them 
allowing Body Shop members to utilize the facility.)

Other Capital Campaigns -- We are currently evaluating several other capital 
contribution requests.  Each is outlined below.  We are proceeding in several 
ways.  First, I am scheduling a meeting with Marty Sunde to discuss EES's 
interest in pursuing energy service agreements with these not-for-profit 
institutions.  As you know, EES is focusing its current efforts on much 
larger scale energy portfolios.  Secondly, I am working to evaluate these 
requests based on the leveraging opportunities associated with each.  
Finally, we want to be equitable in our giving to these local campaigns as 
well as consistent in our giving philosophy.  We are working to balance these 
requests relative to each other and to our goal to transfer dollars away from 
multi-year gifts toward programs.

Texas Heart Institute -- I had breakfast yesterday with Bob Devlin, Dr. 
Denton Cooley, Jack Doherty and Meredith Long.  They shared with me plans for 
a new Texas Heart Institute building in the Medical Center.  (The building 
will bear a striking resemblance to our buildings -- oval in shape and bluish 
glass.)  They are conducting a $75 million campaign -- $42 million to build 
and equip the building and $33 million to sustain programs in research and 
education.  They are requesting $1 million from Enron and will allow us to 
specify how the gift is spent.  American General and Shell Oil Foundation 
have each contributed $1 million

Baylor College of Medicine -- Amy Lee and I had lunch last week with several 
folks from Baylor.  They are in the midst of a campaign to fund their many 
programs in research and education.  We discussed opportunities to expand our 
existing medical-based literacy program - Prescription for Reading.  They 
also outlined for us numerous other sponsorship opportunities.  No specific 
dollar amount was requested.  While several pharmaceutical companies have 
contributed in the $500,000 to $1 million range, most of our local peers are 
within the $100,000 to $500,000 range.

University of Houston - MD Anderson Library and the Honors College -- As you 
know, the University is requesting $500,000 from Enron over 5 years to 
support renovation of the library.  Since our call with Harriet Latimer, I've 
conducted some research to determine what other local corporations are 
contributing.  Currently, no companies have made a financial commitment.  In 
fact, only Compaq and Shell have committed at all with in-kind 
contributions.  While I am confident that we will support this in some way, I 
am particularly interested in speaking with Steve Barth and Chet Gladchuck at 
the University to determine if the library could be rolled into the energy 
services agreement we are currently evaluating with the University's athletic 
department.

On a separate note, you'd forwarded to me a request from the University to 
fund a publication ""The Future of International Education:  Directions & 
Opportunities.""  Elyse Kalmans discussed this with her contacts at U of H.  
They indicated that this was not a high priority for them and would rather 
have Enron commit its resources to other University endeavors, such as the 
library.  We have chosen to decline this request.

I apologize for the length of this memo.  However, I did want to keep you 
updated on the status of these various requests.  I will present 
recommendations to you on each of these pending requests in the coming 
weeks.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please 
contact me.

777,"Dear Friends, Family and Wedding Party,
I am attaching a tentative itinerary for the wedding
weekend. Some of the times for transportation and hair
appointments may change as we finalize the schedules,

 hold a DVD player?   Consolidating orders could work for me, even if it me=
ant a slight delay in arrival. Pet peeve number 1 - After many hours of ""br=
owsing"" items and comparing prices, I settled on an item.   Three days late=
r I received an email saying that the item was out of stock.   This reminde=
d me of retail bait and switch tactics.  If you don't have the product, tak=
e it off your site! Pet peeve number 2 - Customer service representatives w=
ho don't have information about your online order.   If you are going to se=
ll online you need to service your online customers.   The days of being ab=
le to say - ""I will research this and get back to you"" are over.  Companies=
 need to empower their front line personnel with data.   It's too easy for =
me just to place my next order with the competition. Pet peeve number 3 - L=
et me track my package.  Those sites that do not allow tracking of orders c=
ost company more money.  It means you had to place numerous calls to their =
service department to check on delivery status. Pet peeve number 4 - Shoppi=
ng carts that ""lock up"".  When this happens I not only abandon my order, I =
abandon doing business with the company. Great stuff number 1 - After placi=
ng an order some companies sent me an email with a discount gift certificat=
e to use on my next order.  This ""25%"" sent me rushing back to the site, wh=
ich built customer loyalty. Great stuff number 2 - Payal.  When buying on e=
Bay, this service allows you to email funds directly to the seller.  No mon=

These are very difficult times for all of us, but I know that you and those who work closest with you are under unbelievable pressure at this time.  It's difficult for all of us, but you and your staff need to know that you have a great deal of support within the company.  Since I started with EDC in 1996, I have often felt that this is the best job that I ever had.  In good times and not-so-good times, the work has been interesting, challenging and even fun!  Now that you are ""back"" many of us are more confident of the future -- even at this time when things appear to be so bleak.

Enron has treated me very well in the past, and although we face an uncertain future, I will continue to support the company and especially you.   Your gestures toward the employees are much appreciated.    I have always admired your kind and  respectful attitude toward all who work for Enron, never more than now.   You have been our best representative and our best supporter, not to mention what you have done for the city of Houston.  No matter what happens, I will always feel privileged to have been a part of this organization.

Just wanted to send you an e-mail to let you know how much I appreciate all you have done for Enron employees.  I guess I have been more sad thinking about what you must be going through.  Just know that many people love and respect you.

God bless you,

795,"
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

"
796,"Ken and Jeff:

Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.

Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.

If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.

I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.

Thanks.

I greatly appreciate your reply, I also agree that the merger was the best alternative, given the circumstances. It saddens me to think that I will not be working for Enron, I had planned to retire from here.  I pray that you will be at peace with your decision and that you will have a happy retirement, put it all behind you and know that you did everything you could and we have a great amount of respect and appreciation for you.  We will definitely miss you and your leadership.  I hope that Dynegy appreciates the value that they are obtaining and the gift of the talented and innovative employees that they will be getting.  Everything will work out for the best.

Thank you again for your response.

Nathan has mentioned that other parties have been in discussions to purchase Enron Broadband (in whole). I am assuming that a due-diligence package exists. What I am looking for is:
 
1)       A complete list of assets (fiber routes, co-location facilities, equipment).
2)       Balance Sheet and Income statement for Enron Broadband. Please breakout the income statement by month and category.
3)       Customer List along with MRRsand terms of contracts

Ken,

I wanted to let you know that I spoke with W.O. King at the Baker Institute earlier today.  Everything is ready for tomorrow's activities.

There will be a great deal of media coverage for the event.  Many media outlets will be accessing the live video feed of Chairman Greenspan's speech.  However, the media will not be able to interview any participants directly.  Chairman Greenspan will only answer written questions submitted by the audience (including media), and those questions will be vetted twice.  I will be receiving the media advisory that has been distributed and the most current media attendee list from the Baker Institute tomorrow.  I will provide that to you as early as possible. 

You probably know that, because of his position, Chairman Greenspan can not accept the prize itself, but only the ""honor"" of being named an Enron Prize recipient.  For that reason, the Enron Prize will not be present on stage during the ceremony.  

Karen Denne, Christie Patrick and I will be attending.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information prior to the event.

See you there,

Dear Mr. Lay,
 
I just wanted to drop you a  note and personally wish you the best of luck with Enron Corp. through the  holidays and in the coming new year.  Although I am not a stockholder,  I've always believed that Enron Corp. was on the cutting edge of everything  that was good about the energy business, and what's right for Texas in  particular.
 
My wife works for the  American Heart Association here in Austin. She said you and your  company have been a long time and generous supporter of AHA.  Thank  you for that.  
 
As I was reading in the  Austin American Statesman this morning, I understand that you have gone to great  lengths to do ""the right thing"" for everyone  concerned.  I firmly believe  that you will come out of this situation on top and continue to prosper and  profit as always.
 
P.S.  I hope that my email moniker of  ""elduque"" didn't throw you.....I am not with any east coast competitor!  I  picked it up while watching a World Series game last year and thought it  appropriate at the time, when Yankee pitcher ""Elduque"" was busy striking  out the side. Here's hoping you can do the same!
 
 
 
Best Wishes For The Holiday Season!!
 
 
 
Respectfully,
 
 
Douglas Smith"
810,"Dear Mr. Lay,
I just want to send you a note to say thank you for all you've done for Enron.  I've been with Enron for 15 years (straight out of college).   I may have been impacted financially with what is currently going on but I certainly don't blame you nor anyone for that matter.  It just is.  Thanks to Enron, I have had a very good job for the last 15 years.  This might be the only company I've known but I do have friends that work at other company and this I know.  Not all companies give employees bonuses, stock options, ESOP, upward mobility, matching retirement funds, cash accounts, competitive salary, challenging work environment, on-site health care, on-site workout place, subsidized cafeteria, matching gift giving, involvement in charitable work and community, and many other good things.  I know that you and Enron have always care for the employees and for the community.  

In this time of crises, I'm sure there will be criticism no matter what you do but please do not pay attention because your family and friends and I'm sure many employees know that you are an honest and classy person with much integrity.  

THANK YOU ALWAYS."
811,"Dear Mr. Lay,

It would be difficult for me to describe the excitement I experienced when I
first knew that I was soon to be an Enron employee over a year ago.  I came
into Enron in EES August 2000 as an Account Manager in the Costa Mesa
office.  I asked for the most challenging assignment available and was given
the opportunity to manage the relationship and contract execution between
EES and the majority of our marquis national customers (Owens-Corning,
Suiza, Quebecor, General Cable, Packaged Ice etc).  I really loved that
assignment and (according to the PRC) was excellent at what I did.

I (like many others at Enron) left a very lucrative job to join EES and I
have turned away several opportunities since joining the company.  I had
envisioned being a part of something as exciting and innovative as Enron as
more rewarding than following more lucrative job offers.  Now, I find myself
in a position that I would have never dreamed of:
*		I'm uncertain about my job security
*		Like so many others, I've lost significant personal wealth
*		I'm not proud or excited to tell others that I work for
Enron
*		I fight with my instinct to leave hoping that I can be a
part of something good coming from all of this.

I don't understand how this could have happened.  So many decent, hard
working, loyal, honest people are being devastated by the results of
questionable management, a lack of leadership and the appearance of abject
greed among Enron Sr. executives.  This is a truly sad state of affairs that
will be the subject of so many ""B"" school projects most of which will focus
on our mistakes.

So, what can a guy so far down the food chain do these days to help right
the ship?  I am here, I do not want to abandon ship and I am ready willing
and able to make a difference.  Mr. Lay, there are some brilliant employees
buried below layers of management that have proven little more than
incompetence.  Consider finding time to visit the troops in the field and
solicit input.  I believe you can find more hope for resurrection out here
than behind the filters that exist between you and your real employees.

My prayers are with you,

U.S. CLIMATE POLICY: WHAT'S NEXT?

In a move that stunned the world, the Bush administration withdrew U.S. support for the Kyoto Protocol that addresses climate change. The protocol, which was never submitted for Senate approval, would have limited greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries. The question is what to put in its place.  As the Bush administration grapples with this complicated problem, we have assembled a team of experts to share their views on sensible climate policies for the U.S. in a post-Kyoto world.

Ken:

This idea might be more appropriate for the Management Conference rather than tomorrow, but I suggest a fifth value or at least implicit emphasis of a value within our values--humility.

There are different dictionary definitions of the term, but the one that fits Enron best is ""not proud or haughty; not arrogant or assertive.""  We want to be proud but not haughty, arrogant, or assertive, so there is a fine line with the term.

""Humility"" is really a necessary characteristic of any firm participating in the ""creative destruction"" of open markets.  It reflects the fact that 1) the market and exogenous events are orders of magnitude greater than any one company, individual, or institution, and 2) a company's performance, no matter how positive, is just a temporary, even fleeting, evaluation of consumers, investors, employees, and the general public.  After all, everyone has choices.

The humility value has been one of the most important for Charles Koch of Koch Industries.  Koch has certainly had their share of problems and has a very different business model from Enron.  But what is important is that Charles is a very serious student of market-based ideas and sees this value coming straight from Joseph Schumpeter, F. A. Hayek, and others in the free market vanguard.  I wholly agree.

826,"As we have discussed at the Board level as well as in Management Commitee, the default swap market is extremely illiquid.  While it is true that ENE is one of the most liquid names in the market, the entire market would move based on an order of $40 to $50 MM.  We have heard that there have been standing sell orders in the market totalling approximately $150 MM which have yet to be absorbed, it could be that the prices moved significantly in order for those sellers to find a buyer.

While this market is an important datapoint in evaluating the credit markets view of our name, it is not the sole determinant.  It is important to note that secondary trading levels of our bonds (a far more liquid market and accurate indicator of our ability to raise incremental capital) have only widened 5 - 10 basis points over the course of the day. 

While I would very much like to tighten the spreads in the default swap market, I think that we need to keep those price markers  in perspective.  Having said that, anything we can do to support the credit and tighten those prices ultimately helps in our ability to raise debt in all markets.

829,"Mr. Lay,

I am writing to you this afternoon because I am concerned for the safety of me and my coworkers here at Enron.  In light of the recent events that have happened I am worried that security here at Enron is still lacking.  I only say this because just this morning I forgot my Enron badge, so I had to get a guest pass, this of course is not a big deal and happens all the time.  However, I had my backpack with me like usual and nobody seemed to even raise an eyebrow.  Now obviously I pose zero threat to Enron but I feel like somebody who walks in with a guest pass needs only a drivers license, which hasn't been a problem for most terrorists to acquire, of somebody who works here at Enron.  Can you see where I am going with this?  

Anyway, I'm a first year analyst and this whole event makes me more and more nervous as time progresses and the events unfold.  I only come to you with this concern because I am not the only one of my friends who have mentioned it.  Please take this into consideration and know that I only raise this issue for the safety of everybody.

Sincerely,

So it's a near-certainty that more stimulus is coming from Washington. But
the details change
constantly, as trial balloons are floated and shot down day after day. Some
quick highlights:
? In stark contrast to its foreign policy/defense team, the Bush economic
brain trust looks inept, unable to
coordinate its plans and apparently unwilling to provide much direction to
Congress.
? Filling that vacuum are Republicans who want big tax cuts and Democrats
who want to spend much
more.
? This means the budget surplus in fiscal 2002 is in free fall. It's
possible that the budget could go into
deficit this year, but our guess is that it will be in the black by a
little, probably under $50 billion. But
these estimates aren't worth much right now - the big story is that the

ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
September 2001, Number 21

THE EVER-CHANGING U.S.-MEXICO RELATIONSHIP
Sidney Weintraub

I have written extensively on U.S.-Mexican relations during the past several decades, perhaps more than on any other theme. I have a daughter who was born in Mexico and feel warmly toward the country. My research, visits, conversations, and analysis provide many insights-even if imperfect knowledge. Examination of this relationship became a national pastime last week when President Vicente Fox made a highly publicized state visit to the United States.

The overused clich? was that the United States had a love/hate attitude toward Mexico. This is too strong; the emotions never ran that deep. The duality of feeling was more like hope/disdain-a wish that Mexico would deal with its deep economic, social, and political problems, and at the same time an attitude of condescension that Mexico never seemed to accomplish this. The Mexican duality toward the United States was something on the order of ambiguity/mistrust-should we embrace the United States or keep our distance out of wariness that Mexico might be betrayed at crucial moments?

Fox, in his speech to a joint session of the U.S. Congress on September 6, said that the moment of change, particularly for Mexico, was when NAFTA came into existence, at the beginning of 1994. I agree with this judgment. NAFTA was the most profound agreement between the two countries in the twentieth century. NAFTA, in my view, used trade and investment as the route to long-term political embrace; and the extent to which this will go will be unknown for perhaps 50 years. I must confess that I had little sympathy with the NAFTA naysayers in either country because I felt that they lacked a sense of what neighborly relations could be-but instead focused on their particular interests or foibles, and not on how two countries thrown together by fate could and should handle their neighborly destinies. The obscenity of a rich United States coexisting with a poor neighbor is unhealthy for both, because it spawns such problems as undocumented migration, and is perpetually destabilizing.

The U.S. reception of Fox was remarkably warm. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) brought NAFTA into existence, but it was Fox's victory in the July 2, 2000, presidential contest that alerted the U.S. audience that our neighbor to the south was transforming itself into a democracy. A troubled neighbor, an important economic partner, and a country that had shed much of its political authoritarianism-Fox embodied all these attributes.

Yet, considerable condescension toward Mexico remains in the U.S. body politic, as it does in popular sentiment. The congressional vote to prohibit Mexican trucks from crossing the border to deliver goods throughout the United States-despite a commitment to do so in an agreement approved by Congress-was an illustration of this. Domestic politics was more important to the U.S. Congress than the Mexican relationship, more important than keeping the U.S. word. If, instead of Mexico, this had been a disagreement with Canada, or the United Kingdom, or Germany, would Congress have acted as it did? I doubt it. Will Congress give up its insistence on certifying Mexico's behavior in the fight against drug use? It has not until now, despite the evident futility and resentment caused by this practice. Maybe now it will. If so, chalk this up to Fox.

The central theme of Fox's speeches in the United States was ""trust."" Trust your neighbor, and he will return this sentiment. Punish your neighbor to force him to change his ways, and you will earn no trust in return-nor is he likely to change his ways. Fox is correct that this trust does not yet exist in full measure in either direction. The reason for this goes back to another clich? about the relationship-that it is asymmetric. Mexican analysts invoke asymmetry constantly. Economic asymmetry explains migration from Mexico to the United States; power asymmetry explains the fluctuating U.S. attention on Mexico; democratic asymmetry explains the differences in the administration of justice; historic asymmetry explains the mutual mistrust. One could continue endlessly; the asymmetry is real and it has consequences.

The United States is most comfortable in its relations with other developed countries, those that have reasonably comparable per capita incomes. Maybe some day Mexican incomes will approach those in the United States, but not for many years. The United States has close relationships with countries that share some of the burden of common defense. This is unlikely for Mexico. Achieving truly mature relations will require other accomplishments: more trade and investment; sustained economic growth in Mexico; a deepening of democracy; a reduction in Mexican corruption; an equitable system of justice; and an end to the need for Mexicans to emigrate, in violation of U.S. laws, to support themselves and their families. A superior/dependent situation does not permit a dialogue of equals.

The two countries' separate but intertwined histories have left a legacy of hangups on both sides. Historical experience explains much about Mexico's drive to retain its economic and political independence, and why it chose to remain distant from its powerful neighbor. This exercise in limited engagement was reciprocated in the United States; Mexico was seen as a troublesome neighbor, a poverty-ridden country that could not provide jobs for all of its people but instead had to rely on the escape valve of migration to the United States. It was not too many years ago (1996) that a best-seller was entitled Bordering on Chaos.

Fox did not initiate the changes taking place in Mexico. Many initiatives, in addition to NAFTA, preceded his election. Mexico had long had a policy of avoiding the discussion of migration issues with the United States, but then undertook a joint study of this subject under President Ernesto Zedillo that was published in 1998. The electoral laws that permitted Fox's election obviously had to be enacted beforehand. The conclusion that engagement with the United States was preferable to distancing it was made before Fox. Fox owes a deep debt of gratitude to Zedillo for relinquishing the leadership without a financial crisis, something that had eluded PRI presidents for some 30 years.
What the Mexican leadership concluded before Fox was that economic independence was a charade given the limited size of the Mexican domestic market and the inability in any event to escape the consequences of U.S. economic policies. I have long believed that the most important U.S. actions toward Mexico are taken without regard to their effects on Mexico-actions like raising and lowering the federal funds rate and managing the U.S. economy so as to achieve growth. It is the level of this growth that rejects or stimulates imports from Mexico. When NAFTA was negotiated the Mexican assessment was that national cultural identity need not be sacrificed in the pursuit of economic development. Indeed, without this development, a majority of Mexicans would have been excluded from the bulk of the nation's rich cultural offerings.

The United States responded positively to the Salinas proposal for free trade under the first President George Bush. Presidents Bill Clinton and now George W. Bush have pushed this engagement further. The laggard has been the U.S. Congress because of a variety of parochial interests, and an inability to shed long-ingrained habits of disrespect for Mexico.

Fox will not achieve all he seeks immediately-especially on U.S. immigration policy. Maybe never, but I doubt this. What his visit demonstrates is that he came to power at a propitious time, found a sympathetic ear in the person of the U.S. president, and has moved the negotiating agenda forward. This is not the end game-that must occur internally in each of the two countries-but it is a giant leap.

844,"Mr Lay:

It is easy for me to understand the feelings of anger of many of my co-workers and peers as the turn of events at Enron has probably taken the worst possible route.

I do not understand, however, why so many people blame you personally for the whole process. This is a business issue, and as a business failure, the ""fault"" if there is such thing, belongs to no one. It's just a fact of life that businesses fail, and businesses succeed. Enron was always on top, and when that was the case, although people recognized your leadership, the common knowledge was that it was all a ""team effort"". 
I find it unfair and unhealthy to hear people's currennt comments about upper management including, particularly,  yourself. I  have the sense that for many people it has become a personal thing, and that should definitely should not be the case.

As a personal note, I have to say that I feel for you. Seeing what you built for many years crumble to dust like Enron has, and then leave with that legacy must not be easy. The closest analogy I can think of is the Concorde. There are many parallels among the Concorde and Enron. Both were a marvel of innovativeness, technology and talent, each in its own time. After Concorde's first crash last year, it was imperative that it fly again. It would have been a bitter and undignified end for such a graceful, advanced machine if it did not. Many engineers, originally involved in the process of building Concorde in the 60's and 70's came out of retirement to participate in its modification process. And now, it is flying again, with pride. 

Given the pragmatic and cold facts of business, I do not think you will have that opportunity. Whether Enron flies again  (and I'm sure it will) you will not be a participant to its re-birth. Even though for the past 2 months you have spent countless sleepless nights, away from your family and trying effortlessly to get the best possible solution, you will not be here to see the fruits of your work. For some time to come, people will associate you with Enron's demise, and will blame you for it. Few will remember that it was you who made Enron what it was, in our best days. I believe strongly that that is not fair.

Thanks for what you have done, for the past 25 years and the past 3 weeks. You are probably one of the people most affected by this, at least emotionally. Thanks for your courage in keeping us updated, through voicemails and e-mails, knowing that most of them will be deleted, just by the mention of ""office of the chairman"". And please keep in mind that there are a lot of people out there that recognize what you've done, your recent efforts, your strength and presence of mind in these tough times.

My only hope is that you will find solace and tranquility, in knowing that what you should remember of your tenure at Enron is all the years you were at its helm, not the last 6 months and horrible 3 weeks.

Martin Gonzalez

ETS"
845,"Dear Mr Lay,
 
I don't know if this will get to you personally or if someone filters your email, but I sincerely hope you get a chance to read this.
 
I haven't been with Enron very long.  I was hired in August and left my old job in Austin because I wanted the experience of working for a great company.  I want you to know that I do not regret my decision to come here.  I have never worked for a company that treats people with such dignity.  It amazes me that throughout all of this, I knew that you would do everything you could to make sure that the employees are okay.  I can't say that I would have felt that way at any other job I have had.  I know now that good companies are out there, and have no doubt that I will have a chance to experience that again.
 
The past few months must have been a nightmare for you.  I cannot imagine what it feels like to build a company to greatness and watch it disintegrate because of the greed of a few.  I'm sure that no words can console you, but I want you to know that most of the employees I have talked to do not blame you.  
 
Whatever happens next week, I want you to know that you are in my prayers.

Character Building

During the winter months, with all the snow and cold, you probably
notice the icicles that often form on houses, cars, and trees. Bet you
didn't think of them having a spiritual lesson embedded in them did
you?

Have you ever stopped to consider how they are formed? Have you noticed
that the dripping water froze, one drop at a time, until over a period
of days, the icicle was a foot long or more. If the water is clean, the
icicle remains clear and sparkles brightly in the sunlight; but if the
water is ever so slightly muddy, that icicle will be cloudy. The beauty
and brilliance will be spoiled.

Our character is formed in like manner. Each thought,
every feeling, and all of our actions influence the whole, bit by bit.
Each decision that we make, both great and small, contributes its part.
Everything we take into our minds and souls -- the impressions,
experiences, and words we absorb and use -- all of these work together
to create our character.

We should be aware of the ""droplets of influence"" we allow to slowly
build our lives. After all, Solomon said, ""The integrity of the upright
shall guide them."" (Proverbs 11:3)

When the Son shines on your life -- are you clear and clean, or has
your character become cloudy? What droplets of influence are you
putting into your character?

Mr. Lay, 
The scripture today was from Psalms 7 through Psalms 10. I am so overwhelmed with what God is showing me. I so hope you are being ministered to. 
I just heard from a friend that you are apparently going to have to appear in court. I don't know if this is true but the message is still the same. God loves you. I know that you, maybe above all the rest, KNOW that. Minister to the others that know Him. Pray for them, with them. They need to know the One that we know.
I am glad I heard so that I may pray for you specifically. 
12/7/01: Lord, all through this You have shown me over and over your holiness but most of all, more than all, Your grace. You lead me to confess this morning that I have not trusted the hand of God because I didn't really trust the heart of God. In all of this, You have shown me Your heart. By showing me Your heart for one of Your children in trouble, grave trouble, You have made me know You. How could I deny a Father that has such kindness towards His children? One that does NOT accuse us but says ""Come to me, I will give you rest. I will save you. It gives me pleasure to give you the Kingdom."" 
Lord, Mr. Lay, probably already knows all of this and maybe this has all been for me. All I know is that more than ever, I come before You on behalf of my brother, Ken. You, above all others, know every thought, every fear, every doubt, every arrow from the enemy that has made its way through. Every verse that you have uttered into my heart has been about how you love him. How you delight in him. How you do not condemn him. How you see the righteous acts he has done. Maybe even from seeds sown in his life long ago - I don't know - but You have shown me certainly that this is the God I want to give my whole heart to. I don't want to hold anything back anymore, ever again. I am in love with you, Jesus. I thank you for the emphasis on the verse about how You will MAKE us love YOU with all our hearts, souls, minds, and strength. 
Do that for Mr. Lay, Lord. Do that for him. Pour out Your Spirit on him so that he can't help but completely give up to this God of his. This God that has never left him-will never leave him. This Father that says ""I delight in you"". This Bridegroom that says, ""I promise to take care of all your needs. I want you with me for the rest of my life"". This Son given to us as a baby. Laid at the feet of mankind as The Lamb offering that God required. Like You lead Abraham to prophesy so many years before ""And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together"" (Genesis 22:8). Lord, YOU ALONE ARE WORTHY OF OUR PRAISE. Thank you. In Jesus name.

850,"Dear Ken,

Several weeks ago I sent you an email regarding the amount of money you
owe me as a result of Enron's demise.  Thus far you have not responded.

Based on today's closing stock price for Enron, the current amount you
owe me and my family is now $1,171,968.00 which must be replaced in my
401K . This money you so callously destroyed was intended to pay for my
children's education and provide a retirement fund for my wife and me.
I worked for Enron for almost 19 years and I earned every bit of this
retirement.  Have you ever lived in Midland Texas where the dust blows
so thick you cannot see or breathe?  I experienced these conditions
often when I lived there while I worked for Enron.  Have you ever lived
in Minnesota and cleared snow drifts 6 feet high when the wind chill was
100 degrees below zero so you could get your children to school?  I did
many times when I lived there and worked for Enron. I could give you
more examples but I do not want to bore you.

If you have a shred of honesty or an ounce of decency left in your
miserable skin, you will refund this money to me.

I previously sent you an email regarding Enron Kids.  What is the status?  I found a job starting after the first of the year, and I would like to put my son back in Enron Kids.  Is there any possibility that the rate will be reduced?  I was paying $560 before with a subsidy from Enron.  The job I accepted does not pay as much as I was making at Enron.  My son and I both loved Enron Kids and the teachers and I would really not have to start him over in another daycare, if possible.
 
Thank you for your consideration.

877,"Mr. Lay--

I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports
Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million
prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by
the partners to the referendum campaign.

Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect
to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this
week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the
partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from
each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed
to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this
procedure with Sue Walden.

With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and
Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum
campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action
committee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the
general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of
these laws provides that ""a person may not knowingly make or authorize a
political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the
person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the
person actually making the contribution . . . .""   Pending a better
understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the
partnership's account.

Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have
any questions regarding the foregoing.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle"

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

Not knowing the correct department or individual to write to I am forwarding 
my comments to you knowing they will get directed to the correct team. 

I just completed watching the Enron All Employee Meeting you hosted in 
Houston on my PC in my office. What a fantastic way to conduct a meeting. I 
was able to listen while I worked, stopping only when a particular subject 
aroused my attention. And being able to see the slide presentation at the 
same time was so much better than  trying to read that little type from a 
long distance over a sea of heads that keep bobbing. 

The only problem I experienced was a cutting out of the audio signal. Once a 
situation like this is resolved I believe Enron may have found the ideal 
solution to communicate to all their employees in a less costly and time 
consuming method than the standard meeting. 

Thanks for taking my comments.

The attached one pager describes an embryonic idea for a new philanthropy

It is inspired by the populist arguments on the campaign trail against

It is even worse than the stealth tax increase in  '96 because it cuts to the

"
904,"Mike has suggested that we cut back  board meetings to fewer than the eight 
(8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked 
other peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.? 
?
I think that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to 
7 this year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be 
dropped most easily are June or  September.? 
?
June,  because we have the two day strat  plan meeting in July, and Sept. 
because we don't yet have 4th quarter results  and not a lot of new 
information is available.
?
I think that the board meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq 
executive time and energy. I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 
or 7 meetings right, getting the company back on  track and? increasing 
earnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we  eliminate the 
September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for  many people as 
exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September  meeting (5 
members).? In looking back, we seem to be able to ""fill the  house"" in June.
?
On the other hand, you all may want to  continue with the number of meetings 
we currently have.? I will await your  reply.

On behalf of Rajat Gupta, Chairman of the Indian School of Business (ISB),
I am writing to invite you to an informal meeting of the ISB on Sunday
January 28, 2001 from 1000AM to 1200Noon at the Belvedere Hotel in Davos,
Switzerland. This date and location coincides with the World Economic Forum

would like to take this opportunity to have an informal meeting like we did
earlier this year. Based on feedback from the last meeting, we have limited
the meeting to two hours only. I do hope you will join us if you are going
to be in Davos. We will send out a detailed note on the agenda and
logistics once we hear back from you.

With thanks and best regards,

We are getting tremendous recruitment-advertising insertions into the 2001 IT 
Career Guide in the ""Employment Review"" banner feature within the ""USA Today"" 
Year in Review issue December 29, 30 & 31.

Many organizations are looking to get in front of the right candidates before 
the January 14 and 21 ""hiring rush"" that takes place in the Sunday 
newspapers' unemployment sections.

Consider this:

* Most candidates make the decision to seek new employment during the holiday 
season.

* Historically, ""Year In Review"" issues have broader readership and a longer 
shelf life.

* The December 29th weekend looks to be one of the heaviest travel periods of 
the year.

* The January 14 and 21 Sunday newspapers' unemployment sections will be the 
largest sections of the year - will your recruitment ad be seen?

* ""USA TODAY"" is the No. 1 read daily newspaper among IT professionals - 
reaching more than 4,600,000 active and passive IT candidates.

The ""2001 IT Career Guide"" will feature editorial on ""In-Demand Careers and 
Hot Industries"" for 2001 and a bannered recruitment-advertising section.

Reach candidates in your area with any one of the 25 advertising print 
markets within the United States.

I just sent in an additional contribution to the Bush

want you to be aware so that you can assure it is
credited to your fundraising efforts.
Secondly, I've been doing a little more research on
the elusive Discover Communications, INC., my personal
dream company.
They are owned by: Liberty Media Corporations, Cox
Communications, Advance/ Newhouse Communications and
John S. Hendricks (who is the founder, Chairman and
CEO). If you know of any of the above companies or any
possible contact, I would greatly appreciate your
assistance. I am sending my resume to the Discover HR
people, but there are very few job postings and
anything I might be able to do to distinguish myself,
beyond of course my incredible experience, charm and
good nature, would be helpful!
Thanks Dad!

925,"Hi Liz -

The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that 
they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their 
preference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are 
currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their 
family.

They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the 
Vittors have.

Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on 
the 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view 
on the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the 
pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as 
quiet.  The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths.

They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's 
phone number is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should 
arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m.

I know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!!  Thank you so much 
for including me on the Save the Date list.  I feel honored!  Unfortunately, 
we won't be able to come.   Our ""first"" anniversary is June 3, but was 1961!!

	AyyyyyMayyyyy,

	How was your trip?  I hope you were able to get lots of sleep.  Huy tried to get me to go drinking last night, but I was far too tired.  I didn't get done with interviews 	until after 7:00 PM.  Trang said you told her to take care of me while you were gone.  I thought that was very sweet, yet I can't help wondering if you think I can not 	take care of myself (that was a joke by the way). 

	Kelly sent me Linda's numbers with plenty of attitude.  She mentioned something about you having an abundance of time while she has a scarcity of time.  But you 	can't tell her I told you.  

	Looks like I gotta go.  I miss you, and look forward to hearing from you.

	Love,

	Andy"

966,"E prime would have interest in the following expansion plans:

1.  Creating a Cunningham/Maddox connection directly from the Linam plant:
Dave Engbrock (303-308-6002) would have more information on this idea in
terms of volume and rate commitments.

2.  Increasing the CIG/Tumbleweed interconnect capacity from 40,000 to
60,000:  During the summer, e prime flowed up to 15,000 from CIG into TW's
PEPL Pool;  if this capacity were expanded, we might be able to get more
supply off CIG.  The problem we had this summer was that at times the
capacity was reduced to 25,000 due to operational reasons, and that was not
enough room for all shippers.  Any additional supply that e prime brings in
from this area will most likely go to shippers who already have firm
transport to California, or e prime may be interested in shipping this to
the Waha area.

3.  E prime would be interested in 10,000/d of capacity from NW Pipeline to
Socal Topock--term could be anywhere from 1 to 2 years, rate would be the
maximum rate.

976,"New Xcel Energy Combination Completed

Just 17 months after announcement of merger plans, Minneapolis-based Northern 
States Power 
and Denver-based New Century Energies have cleared the last hurdle to combine 
under the new 
name Xcel Energy Inc. The merger creates one of the 10 largest electricity 
and natural gas 
companies in the United States. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued its approval of the merger, 
wrapping up approvals 
from several federal agencies and states where the companies operate. Xcel 
Energy will serve more 
than 3 million electricity and 1.5 million natural gas customers in 12 
states, and 2 million electricity 
customers internationally. Company headquarters will be in Minneapolis. 
Gradually, the NSP and NCE 
names will be phased out as Xcel Energy provides enhanced products and 
services in 12 states, 
including parts of Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan, Kansas, 
Oklahoma, Arizona, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. 

Stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 21, under the 
symbol XEL. Current 
New Century Energies shareholders will receive 1.55 shares of Xcel Energy 
stock for each share of 
NCE they hold. NSP shareholders will get one for one and will not be required

990,Meeting with Michael's teachers
991,"Ben has asked me to prepare a draft Bill of Sale - Equipment schedule to 
support the closing of the Intergen transaction.

I have generated the attached spread sheet showing the following information 
for the two LM6000 turbines and the one ABB transformer:

 Unit Description (Column A)
 Unit Number (Column B)
 Unit Serial # (Column C)
 Unit Delivery Date (Column D)
 Physical location of the units as of the date of schedule (1/5/01) (Column E)
 The equipment and all rights provided to Buyer under Agreement dated ____ 
(Column F)

I have filled in descriptions for each piece of equipment (Column A).  I need 
help with the following:

Chris:  Please fill in Columns B, C, D & E with current information from our 
equipment contracts.

Rebecca:  Please obtain the information for Columns A, B, C, D, E, & F  from 
Catherine in Global Finance.  This should be the information that was 
recorded in the TurboPark financing documents when the equipment option 
agreements were moved into TurboPark from West LB.

Kay:  Please fill in the dates for Column F and let me know if any additional 
information is required to complete this schedule.

Please forward me a revised copy of this spreadsheet once you have completed 
the relevant information.  I welcome your input on the information contained 
within this schedule.

Our goal here is to create a schedule which is factually correct (based on 
all of the relevant agreements) and does not create any 
inconsistencies/conflicts with the TurboPark documents.  We need to deliver a 
draft of this schedule to the TurboPark banks tomorrow  for their review.  
This schedule represents one of four documents required to effect a smooth 
transfer of the relevant equipment interests from TurboPark into the 
respective CA Development entity and close this transaction prior to the 
1/15/01 deadline.

Call me to discuss any of this information.

this one step further so that the entire amount could be recognized in Q2.

Since we haven't had any luck hooking up on the telephone, I wanted to 
transmit to you an initial draft of a facility agreement, as contemplated by 
the contract for the transformer packages for the LM's.  I would have sent 
this to Dave, but I don't seem to have his email address.

Since the WestLB financing facility is scheduled to expire soon, we need to 
get the transformers transferred into our new facility, as well as get them 
contractually allocated to various projects.  Please give me a call or have 
Dave call me so that we can handle this as expeditiously as possible.

If we have the same purchaser for both, it would be a lot easier to agree to 
the form, then duplicate it.  Do you see any problem with this? I will have 
to have the electronic form emailed to me, then I can make the changes.  I 
brought the hard copy, but I don't have access to the electronic form. Have 
they indicated if they want to go forward with this, or are they still 
kicking tires?  I need to set priorities, so it would help to know what's 
most important, especially since I'm on the road.  Do we want to continue 
marketing the sites during the time period between signing and termination?  
I don't think 3 weeks would be a problem after signing.  No TurboPark!!!

On the issue of the conference call Friday, I have a meeting with the 
customer which starts in the am, then I'm on the road.  Monday would be 1000

1053,"Tom, want me to start ordering lunches just for our group?  I could even take specific orders for what each person likes, and have them bill us or put it on someone's credit card.  I can do that for just the EOL guys, too.  I found out that the deliveries are going to ECN, and the clerks are picking them up from there.  Well, at lunchtime, I could take a dollie with me to carry it all, and/or have Michael Salinas help me.  I don't know ... whatever you'd like.  That's just a suggestion that I have, if you would still like to pull away from the daily lunches for the whole floor.  I've noticed a lot of our guys don't like the lunches, and they sometimes go get food from the Energizer.  We still get billed for their food, even if they don't eat.  

Let me know if you'd still like to do this, because it's definitely possible.

At Least Two Bids Seen For Enron Trading Ops - Lawyer

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) expects at least two bidders to come in Monday with offers to jump-start the energy company's trading operations.
""We expect bids today. Probably two or more,"" said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer who represents Enron in its bankruptcy proceedings in New York. 
Bienenstock declined to identify possible bidders. 
But a person familiar with the matter said that Citigroup (C), one of Enron's main creditors, would likely be among those bidding for Enron's trading assets. 
Bids are due by 4 p.m. EST Monday. An auction will be held Thursday.

Enron Trading Ops - 2: Bids Won't Include Cash

01/07/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Under a plan designed to bring back some value to its trading operations - including EnronOnline which, until not so long ago, accounted for 25% of all wholesale energy trading in the U.S. - Enron has been looking for a 51% partner with great credit worthiness to form a joint venture. 
Under the joint venture, dubbed New Energy Trading Operations, or NETCO, Enron and its partner would be sharing revenue.
The deal is crucial to Enron's creditors, including Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), because it's seen as key for those lenders and others to recoup some of the money lost in the Enron's meltdown. 
Citigroup was first expected to emerge as a stalking horse that could have flamed interest from other parties. But that didn't happened. Swiss banking giant UBS AG (UBS) and Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and American International Group Inc. (AIG) have also been reported as a potential bidders. 
Enron's lawyer Bienenstock said that he didn't expect the bids to include any financial payments from the outside parties. 
""This is not about money,"" Bienenstock said. ""We're getting creditworthiness and they're getting a gigantic value in assets."" 
Enron hopes that an alliance with a big-name bidder like Citigroup, UBS or Goldman would bring back customers who began fleeing Enron's trading floors in November when prospects of a merger between Enron and rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) started fading. 
Although Enron has said that it was looking for a 51% partner, the final structure of the venture may vary depending on the bidders' needs, Bienenstock said. 
""Each bidder has its own particular needs and own desires,"" the Enron lawyer said. 
Court documents show that Enron intends to contribute software and hardware to NETCO, not specifying what exact assets are up for grab. 
Bienenstock said he didn't expect a lawsuit brought by software company Solarc Inc. against Enron for copyright infringement to complicate the bidding process. 
""If there was infringement, that could be offset against future distribution"" of revenue, he said. 
Each bidder will have to make a $25 million deposit to prove the validity of its offer. But that deposit will be returned if a bid isn't accepted or if no cash contribution is part of the actual offer. 
Meanwhile, this week's bidding process will likely affect how much financing Enron gets at the end of the month. 
The energy company is now expected to receive less than the $1.5 billion in debtor-in-possession financing first agreed to after it filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. 
As reported, Enron's better-than-expected cash position, now seen around $400 million to $500 million, and continued reluctance by Wall Street to back a new Enron loan are likely to contribute to a much smaller DIP package. 
""We haven't discussed it yet,"" Bienenstock said of the new DIP plan. 
Final approval of the interim financing is scheduled for Jan. 30.

CNN: Special Report With Aaron Brown=20
(c) Copyright eMediaMillWorks, Inc. (f/k/a Federal Document Clearing House,=
 Inc.). All Rights Reserved.=20

We said last night that the collapse of Enron had been largely underreporte=
d. That has now changed, as you will hear tonight, and it is that story, En=
ron that begins our whip around the world. We start at the White House and =
our Senior White House Correspondent John King. John, a headline from you, =
please.=20
JOHN KING, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Aaron, because of Enron's poli=
tical connections, the nation's top prosecutor, the Attorney General John A=
shcroft and his chief of staff, today had to recuse themselves from the gro=
wing criminal investigation into the company's bankruptcy. Why? Because Joh=
n Ashcroft took a lot of money from Enron and its chief executives.=20
The administration also, for the first time today, acknowledged the Enron C=
EO called two cabinet members before the company filed for bankruptcy and a=
sked for help. The administration insists it didn't help him and that it di=
d nothing wrong. Aaron.=20
BROWN: John, a lot on Enron tonight. We'll be back with you shortly.=20
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)=20
BROWN: Enron exploded today. It's been a while since the energy company, th=
e trading company, a Fortune 500 giant went bankrupt, costing investors inc=
luding the company's employees billions of dollars.=20
The story has simmered around for a while, overwhelmed by the war, waiting =
its time in the way a good story does, and the time has finally come. Last =
night, we reported the Justice Department was opening a criminal investigat=
ion, and today the case took a political turn as well, a turn that could we=
ll be the first real threat to the Bush Administration.=20
Developments to report, lots of them. We go back to the White House and Sen=
ior White House Correspondent John King. John, good evening.=20
KING: Good evening to you, Aaron. A complicated story anyway because of the=
 facts, even more so because of the politics. If you brought together senio=
r officials in the Bush Administration and said, everyone with ties to Enro=
n raise your hands, a lot of hands would go up.=20
The President knows the CEO quite well. He's an old family friend. So does =
the Vice President and his Chief of Staff. The President's top political ad=
viser is close to Enron, so is his top economic adviser. Several members of=
 the cabinet too. The White House insists though, there has been no questio=
nable behavior. There are though, a lot of questions.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
KING (voice over): Attorney General John Ashcroft is recusing himself from =
the criminal investigation of Enron, as is his Chief of Staff. The reason, =
$60,000 in political contributions from Enron and its top executives in Cam=
paign 2000, when Ashcroft was running for reelection to the Senate.=20
Another reflection of the political stakes in the Oval Office, the Presiden=
t himself announcing two new cabinet level reviews to determine if the gove=
rnment needs stronger disclosure laws to protect shareholders and investors=
 in 401 (k) and other retirement plans.=20
GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have great concern for th=
e stories, for those I read about in the stories who put their life savings=
 aside and for whatever reason, based upon some rule or regulation, got tra=
pped in this awful bankruptcy and have lost life savings.=20
KING: Energy giant, Enron, first gave a public hint of its financial troubl=
es last October, and then filed for bankruptcy in early December, a major e=
conomic story in any event and a major political story too because Enron an=
d its CEO, Ken Lay, have deep connections to the Bush family and in both po=
litical parties in Congress.=20
BUSH: I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the com=
pany.=20
KING: But Lay did alert top Bush deputies that Enron was in trouble, and as=
ked for help well before the December bankruptcy filing. He called Treasury=
 Secretary Paul O'Neill, and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, in late October =
and O'Neill a second time in early November.=20
Sources say Lay wanted help shoring up the company's bond rating. Aides say=
 Secretaries O'Neill and Evans decided there was nothing the government cou=
ld or should do. The White House says they did not pass the news on to the =
President or any other senior administration officials.=20
ARI FLEISCHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The President is pleased with t=
he actions that his cabinet secretaries took. He thinks they acted wisely a=
nd properly.=20
Lay is an old Bush family friend, and he and his company a major donor to b=
oth political parties. In the 2000 campaign cycle alone, Enron and its exec=
utives contributed more than $2.2 million to federal candidates and politic=
al committees; $74,000 went to the Bush Campaign; $1.5 million to other Rep=
ublican campaigns and committees; and $640,000 to the Democrats.=20
Four Congressional committees are also investigating Enron, and Democrats w=
ant more information on the company's contacts with the Bush White House.=
=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
KING (on camera): In hindsight, and there is always hindsight it seems in s=
uch cases, top Bush Administration officials say yes, they wish word of tho=
se contacts between Ken Lay, the Enron CEO, and Bush cabinet secretaries ca=
me out sooner, but they say in the end, any investigation will show this, t=
hat a top Bush fundraiser asked for help and was told no, and that this Pre=
sident now is showing no hesitancy at all in investigating a man who's not =
only a top political supporter, but a long-time family friend. Aaron.=20
BROWN: You could almost hear Democrats smacking their lips a little bit on =
this one. Was the White House, in the briefings today and around the buildi=
ng, defensive about this or did they seem, people seem comfortable that the=
y're OK?=20
KING: Quite defensive about it, Aaron. Some phone calls after the White Hou=
se briefing by officials saying, why so many questions about this? This is =
an administration of unquestioned integrity. Why do you want to know all th=
ese things?=20
But they also understand now, many Democrats in the Congress saw the invest=
igations of the Clinton Administration, subpoenas for documents in cases th=
at the Clintons thought were way out of bounds, no questions should be aske=
d. The Democrats will ask questions about this. So will reporters.=20
The Bush Administration I think got the message today that they have to be =
quicker and more forthcoming in releasing any, any details at all of consul=
tations or conversations with this company. Again, they say in the end, the=
y will be proven that the President did nothing wrong, and that in fact, hi=
s two cabinet secretaries, one Don Evans a very close friend of Ken Lay, sa=
id no when this man asked for help.=20
BROWN: And just one other quick thing, the decision to have a White House -=
- are these White House investigations into Enron, or White House discussio=
ns about disclosure laws dealing with investments and investors generally?=
=20
KING: There are a number of investigations, so it gets confusing. The Justi=
ce Department, even though the Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney and m=
ost of his staff in Houston, have recused themselves because of political r=
elationships or other relationships. The Justice Department is having a cri=
minal investigation.=20
The Labor Department oversees pensions. It has a separate investigation int=
o the pension programs. Now there will be two cabinet level taskforces head=
ed by the Treasury Department, that involve other departments including the=
 Securities and Exchange Commission, to see if the government did something=
 wrong here, if you will, if there should be stronger rules that require an=
 Enron, when its finances are going south, to tell its shareholders and esp=
ecially to tell its employees who have so much stock in those 401 (k) plans=
. All the Enron executives who knew about this sold their stock. The employ=
ees lost their life savings. The President wants to know if the government =
needs to make sure that doesn't happen again.=20
BROWN: John, the old wire service reported that you are -- you probably wan=
t to chase the fire that's going on somewhere in D.C.=20
KING: We get those out here.=20
BROWN: Yes, thank you for your work tonight. Senior White House Corresponde=
nt John King. We said that the Enron collapse is both a political story and=
 a business story. It's a complicated story to be sure. Tonight, we're join=
ed by someone who can help us understand both the business and the politics=
 of this. Jim Glassman writes a weekly Washington Post investment column. H=
e's also a Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. He joins us tonight=
 from New York. Jim, good evening.=20
JAMES GLASSMAN, HOST, TECHCENTRALSTATION.COM: Good evening, Aaron.=20
BROWN: How could so many -- I mean if you looked at all of the mutual funds=
 and all the investment houses that recommended Enron, the stock price shot=
 way up. It looked like a terrific company. How could so many smart people =
have been so dumb?=20
GLASSMAN: They didn't just recommend it, they owned it. I mean companies li=
ke Janus, Fidelity. There are a lot of analysts that have conflicts of inte=
rest, but many of them, who did not, really praised this company to the sky=
. Fortune named it six years in a row, the most innovative company in Ameri=
ca.=20
Basically, what was going on was that Enron was deceiving investors, deceiv=
ing analysts, overstating the profits it was making, hiding some of the loa=
ns that it had taken out, and as soon as this was found out, the company ba=
sically got capital punishment, which in my opinion it deserved. And I thin=
k it's a good lesson to other companies not to deceive investors.=20
Now, the question of whether it did something illegal or not, is another ma=
tter. Just the fact that it was very clearly trying to say that it was in m=
uch better shape than it was. Unfortunately, a lot of little people got hur=
t.=20
BROWN: I want to talk about that, but are you telling me that a company can=
 mislead investors, mislead the public about how much money it's actually m=
aking or how much debt it actually has, and that is not in and of itself a =
crime?=20
GLASSMAN: Well, what Enron was doing specifically about the debt was, it wa=
s reporting that it had $14 billion in debt. It really had about three time=
s that much, and the other debt was pushed off onto other related entities,=
 and it was very, very difficult for any analyst or the public to find out =
about it.=20
Now, it's very difficult to pass enough accounting rules to take care of ev=
ery shenanigan that a company's going to come up with. What you need is a m=
arket and investors who will crack down really, really hard on companies th=
at are being deceptive, if not dishonest, and that's what's happened in thi=
s case. But yes, it's not hard to hide things. It's not hard at all to hide=
 things.=20
BROWN: That's comforting to know for those of us who have money in the mark=
et.=20
GLASSMAN: But you know, Aaron, really the way to prevent yourself from gett=
ing burned is by being diversified. Things are going to happen like Enron, =
and there have been other cases. There are not that many of them, but there=
 are other cases. And if you have a huge chunk of your retirement savings i=
n one company, this kind of thing can happen, a company that looks good in =
all of its aspects and bang, it turns out that it's not on the level.=20
BROWN: But that's exactly what happened to the employees, that their 401 (k=
) money --=20
GLASSMAN: Yes. Yes.=20
BROWN: -- was going into the company and worse, they were not allowed to se=
ll it.=20
GLASSMAN: Yes, and I think that's a much more serious problem, and that's w=
hat some of the policymakers in Washington are looking into, and I think th=
ere's a lesson for your viewers. You know, most companies make it easy for =
you, as an employee, to buy corporate stock and the problem that you get in=
to is that if you lose your job, not only have you lost your everyday livel=
ihood, but you also may have lost a big chunk of your retirement savings if=
 your company goes out of business, as Enron did.=20
The lock-in, the fact that employees could not sell their stock for a certa=
in period, was not good, and the fact that apparently executives had access=
 to information that employees did not was also not good.=20
BROWN: Jim, next time, and I expect there's going to be one, we need to tal=
k about the politics of this. Thanks for joining us tonight.=20
GLASSMAN: Love to do that. Thank you, Aaron.=20

NEW YORK (AP) - Beleaguered Enron Corp. planned to select one of two suitor=
s to buy its wholesale energy trading operation in an auction expected to e=
nd late Friday morning, a source familiar with the situation said.=20
The auction was being held in private and the selection of a buyer was expe=
cted to be announced at a bankruptcy court hearing that was originally sche=
duled for 10 a.m., but was delayed until noon.
Trading in Enron shares was delayed Friday morning on the New York Stock Ex=
change as negotiations for a sale continued pending an anticipated announce=
ment.=20
Enron said late Thursday that negotiations for a sale were continuing throu=
gh the night.=20
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said early Friday that the=
 talks were continuing and the field had been narrowed to two, but declined=
 to name the suitors. Investment banks that reportedly have an interest in =
buying into Enron include Citigroup Inc. and UBS Warburg.=20
In a related matter, Judge Arthur Gonzalez said he expected to rule Friday =
on a request to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston.=20
Gonzalez will have the final word Friday on any sale that takes place as a =
result of the auction. More than a dozen Enron creditors have filed objecti=
ons to the sale, essentially because they want a better explanation of how =
the proceeds will be divvied up.=20
Dissatisfied creditors will have 10 days to appeal Gonzalez's ruling.=20
Before its collapse late last year, Enron was the world's largest energy me=
rchant, accounting for roughly 25 percent of all trades in a market it help=
ed pioneer. Enron differed from competitors in its penchant for complex bet=
s on everything under the sun - advertising space, broadband, paper, the we=
ather and more than 1,000 other products.

Widening probe of Texas-based Enron could dog Bush as Whitewater plagued Cl=

Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires=20
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.=20

WASHINGTON (AP) - The expanding investigation into the collapse of Enron Co=
rp. and the company's close ties to the Bush administration could quickly t=
urn into a consuming political liability for President George W. Bush in sp=
ite of his currently high approval ratings. And Democrats are pressing hard=
 for just that.=20
At this point, no one is alleging wrongdoing by Bush or top members of his =
administration in the bankruptcy of the Houston-based energy trading compan=
y, a failure that cost thousands of jobs and ravaged the retirement savings=
 of many employees.
But such investigations tend to take on a life of their own. And Democrats,=
 sensing a congressional election-year opportunity, are working hard to tur=
n up the heat.=20
Some Democrats are likening the probe to the Whitewater and campaign fund-r=
aising investigations that plagued former President Bill Clinton.=20
""The reason this is so potentially devastating to Bush is that it brings to=
 life in very real terms the notion that when push comes to shove, he's for=
 the big business special interests and not for the little guy,"" said forme=
r Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart.=20
The controversy deepened on Thursday with the disclosure by the White House=
 that Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, a longtime friend of the president, ca=
lled two of Bush's Cabinet officers - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and C=
ommerce Secretary Don Evans - before the company filed for bankruptcy late =
last year.=20
The disclosure came a day after the Justice Department announced it was ope=
ning a criminal investigation of the energy company's collapse, including w=
hether it defrauded investors by deliberately concealing information about =
its finances.=20
Attorney General John Ashcroft, who received campaign contributions from En=
ron executives during his failed 2000 senatorial bid, stepped aside from th=
e investigation.=20
The collapse, the largest corporate bankruptcy ever, is also being probed b=
y the Labor Department and by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which=
 is looking into the company's destruction of possibly key financial docume=
nts; and by five congressional committees.=20
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, leading one of those inquiries, is promising ""a sear=
ch for the truth, not a witch hunt.""=20
But some Republicans - including White House spokesman Ari Fleischer - used=
 just that term, ""witch hunt,"" on Thursday in describing the widening inves=
tigation.=20
""There's not even smoke here, let alone a fire,"" said Charles Black, a vete=
ran Republican consultant.=20
""They can keep it going in terms of probing Enron, looking into what happen=
ed to those people who lost their pensions, what happened to the accounting=
. All those are legitimate issues,"" said Black. ""But there's no evidence th=
at any elected officials did anything for Enron.""=20
Bush, a former Texas oilman himself, on Thursday told reporters, ""I have ne=
ver discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company."" And Flei=
scher said that no one in the administration offered to intervene on Enron'=
s behalf.=20
""This is hardly going to be a scandal that brings down President Bush, but =
it will be a nagging problem for the Bush administration for some time to c=
ome,"" said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist.=20
But Sabato said it has all the ingredients to become all-consuming ""because=
 the Bush administration is so laden with corporate types and people with t=
ies to the energy industry. It's understandable to the American people. It'=
s the big boys versus the little guys who got hurt.""=20
""These things can be an enormous distraction. But by the end of the Clinton=
 administration, we learned that the best thing to do is assign a team to d=
isclose everything, and to keep everyone else out of it,"" said Paul Begala,=
 a former Clinton political adviser.=20
Lanny Davis, who was special counsel to Clinton from 1996 to 1998, urged De=
mocrats to not take the same low road he claims Republicans took in pursuin=
g the Whitewater and related inquiries.=20
He said so far he sees nothing in the Enron case to link Bush administratio=
n officials to the collapse other than innuendo. ""Let's go after the seriou=
s stuff,"" including why Enron employees were prevented from unloading their=
 Enron stock in their company-managed retirement plans as the share prices =
plunged from over dlrs 80 to under dlrs 1, Davis said.=20
"
1061,"Tom - Here is the 2002 plan we worked on prior to the bankruptcy filing.  Also, the two logistics employees you mentioned are included with Bob Hall on the file David sent you earlier.

1062,"We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

I am an Associate working in Don Miller's ENA estate management group.  British Petroleum has inquired about Enron's existing Firm NG Transport Contracts and available storage contracts.  They specifically listed these types of assets as ones that BP would be interested in looking at buying from Enron.  Can the two of you get back to either Stuart or myself with respect to what is available and some indication of pricing for these assets.  Thanks.

1067,"Per Gas Accounting, before an invoice can be generated in Unify to move ENA's working gas balance to HPLC, Enron needs to execute a confirm and a deal ticket under the existing Master Purchase/Sale agreement between ENA and HPLC.  This will need to be done in order to consolidate the inventory within HPLC for the sale of the working gas to AEP at close.  Otherwise sales will need to be executed at close from both ENA and HPLC.  This won't be feasable since HPLC currently has  a negative working gas balance of (18) BCF and ENA has a positive balance of 20 BCF.  ENA has not had any storage activity at Bammel over the last year (i.e. since the Texas Desk started doing business as HPLC) however withdrawls by HPLC have taken place of gas originally injected by ENA.  All of this gas has been injected and withdrawn as Texas Desk gas but by two different legal entities.  

Jim Pond
Please provide the exact Bammel working gas volumes for ENA to the Texas Desk (David Baumbach) that should be moved to HPLC

Please coodinate the execution of a confirm and Deal Ticket.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

I am currently planning on having Dave run the west risk desk,  and leaving O over Texas.  So I just want to make sure that we are still on the same page with Dave coming back down here.  If not,  I need to make some changes to the organization.

Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly."

1115,"This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option 
pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and 
calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls 
are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will 
result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index 
premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522."

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

John,
 
You are absolutely right. I have advised Tom Barkley to call Larry May before the new Ostrip was pushed out,  making sure it would not affect his book.  For some reason, it was not carried
out correctly. 
 
In the future, I will make sure this will not happen again.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments."

Dear Colleague,

This note is to inform you that, effective January 3, 2002, PIRA Energy
Group will terminate delivery of the Energy Retainer Services, which we

We hope not only that you have found value and use from our comprehensive
fundamental analysis of oil, natural gas, and electricity markets, but that
you have enjoyed working with PIRA and its staff.  We have certainly
appreciated our close working relationship with Enron and we regret the
disruption. We certainly hope that we can restart a relationship with many
of you who will remain with Enron or move on elsewhere. Should it be the

services, please respond to this email or contact Jeff Steele at

These Custom strips will be used to calculate a separate set of Power Indices which will be published on Friday afternoon along with our regular Daily Power Indices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              !

1163,"Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

He added, ""My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."""

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the 777 Clay garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these spaces."

1205,"Please respond to I have done a crappy job of being a witness and a friend.  You are correct,
and rightly so about the way I have patronized you.  It has not been a
conscious effort, but I understand your perspective and as I look at me, I
am forced to admit you are correct.  Christian hypocrites are a dime a
dozen, and I am ashamed that I have fallen far short of what He has called
me to be.

I am very thankful for your business over that last 3 years.  I know that my
success here has been largely because of your help and business and I and my
family thank you for it.

I have taken your name off the Daily Word distribution list as you have
requested.  My best to you and your family and your success in business.  It
is my hope that I can be a better friend, witness and more to you again.

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order. 

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each set of ""zeros"" for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets 
In a combined effort, Global Risk Markets (GRM), a unit of Enron Global Markets, and Southeast Power Origination, part of Enron Americas, closed Enron's first Contingent Call Outage Option in the 1st quarter 2001. The product was created to provide customers with a cost effective risk management tool to hedge against high commodity prices after experiencing an unplanned power generation outage.

The transaction was entered into with UtiliCorp United to manage its generation risk for summer 2001. This risk is associated with a forced outage of their largest coal unit during peak summer demand. The transaction, which was developed jointly with the Southeast Power group, highlights the benefits of cooperation between business units within Enron. GRM is working with a number of business units to integrate this risk management product into other Enron businesses to enhance value to our customers.  For additional information on the product, please call David Hoog in the New York office at 212 702 3920.

NUGGETS & NOTES

Travel Tip of the Week:  Book non-refundable tickets. Airlines typically allow unused non-refundable tickets to be applied towards subsequent travel. Even if you need to make a change at a rate of $100, in many cases the change fee plus the ticket price is still less than a refundable ticket.
	For example:  Houston to Washington, D.C.
	     Refundable:		$ 1,447
	     Non-refundable      	$    540

1237,"Mike,

As a result of the recent reorganization, initially I will be responsible for 
the Weather and Insurance trading activities.  I look forward to working with 
you in these efforts.

What I really wanted to talk to you about is the JDF Walk.  Last year we 
discovered that our 2 1/2 year old son, Brandon, had diabetes.  As you 
remember, and certainly can relate to, this changed our lives forever.  In 
retrospect, I am glad that I got involved in Enron's effort even though it 
was in the last 3-4 weeks.  We have continued to stay involved with JDF by 
attending several events, by visiting the JDF office, and by JDF's proactive 
phone out-reach.  I would like to hear your take on sponsoring a team through 
Enron vs. directly through JDF.  I know that Enron matches the contributions 
if sponsored through Enron; is this possible if we were to go the other route?

Please call or email as I know we are approaching the campaign time.

Thanks,
Todd Hall

11:30 and got up and got a drink of water.  

By the way, the latest, unconfirmed rumor, is that Samatha and Anessa Hall 
Joseph are supposed to be pregnant!  

See you!"
1252,"Hey Sugar Bear!


I was just thinking about you and was hoping that everything is going okay 
for you.  I constantly keep you in prayer regarding your situation.   How's 
Erika doing?

You missed church Sunday when they forceably removed one of the guys (aaron 
Burr) from the church.  You remember he was the one that used to sit on the 
front row and get happy alllllllllll the time.  You remember him, anyway they 
hauled his tail out of there.  It was terrible to see someone hauled from the 
church, not matter what the situation is.

Oh well, take care, and call me if we need to talk!!!!

1254,"Janet,

Colleen Sullivan has replaced Kate Fraser in the team to finalize the 
negotiations
with the folks at Keyspan.  My intention is to finish up the calculations 
that Colleen 
has requested over the next few days so that she can get a feel for the 
offsets that
occur in the proxy pricing given certain decisions.  We will then be able to 
finish up
with Keyspan.  Hopefully, Ed Anderson and Melissa Reges will not be taking any
more vacations for a while.

Colleen has talked to Scott about internally releasing East Origination 
Group's cut of
the accrual profits for Year 2 of the asset management deal.  There should 
not be a
be a problem doing this before the end of the quarter.

Sorry for the delay,

Ruth

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tony Martin , WR ATL - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/21/01 Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at al=
l this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Pant=
hers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in dee=
per Fantasy leagues may be worth considering.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but=
 he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary=
 h! as! n't been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration=
 in deeper leagues is advisable.   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Update=
d 11/21/01 Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy F=
ootball. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last t=
wo games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11.   To=
m Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichic=
k announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for=
 the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe t=
o a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady mig=
ht have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fa=
irly safe weekly starter otherwise.   Dolphins , DT MIA - Martin Updated 11=
/21/01 Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the seas=
on due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to=
 rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's abs=
ence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more =
by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's g=
ame against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 11 =
game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at=
 split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.  Mark Brunell ,=
 QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sidel=
ine him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours bef=
ore last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a=
 strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will=
 start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as y=
ou set your lineups.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Taylor=
 received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin =
injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of =
the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that th=
e injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, an=
d in the meantime Taylor has developed pain ! in! his hip, a side effect of=
 the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again th=
is Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final=
 decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith , W=
R DEN - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough=
 for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss T=
hursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravat=
ed it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith=
 on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Bronc=
os' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it wo=
uld be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/=
20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexa=
nder will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during th=
eir charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the=
 Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/20/01 The Patriot=
s will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No=
. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Bra=
dy is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your ! ro! ster=
 as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadricep=
s) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  R=
icky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has n=
ot sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times .=
 He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun=
 Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as th=
e postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/=
01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy i=
nvolving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback=
,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none=
 within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us=
 the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to =
satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11=
/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder i=
njury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bru=
ener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Ty=
rone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-=
Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to =
play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Kinney =
(calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to ret=
urn to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11=
/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a ri=
sky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 =
The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's pr=
actice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to mi=
ss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updat=
ed 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to st=
art against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 M=
innis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may hav=
e to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/=
01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game ag=
ainst New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome=
 Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the seas=
on. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting,=
 meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lin=
eup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the=
 Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray=
 right now. ``! Th! at's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the star=
ter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play tur=
nover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike Sh=
anahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed t=
o play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evalu=
ate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he ca=
n help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't=
 perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him =
out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay  , RB CLE - Free Agent Update=
d 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how m=
uch Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in som=
e of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free A=
gent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend again=
st Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wid=
e receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Bank=
s , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will s=
tart Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion l=
ast weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury=
 and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free =
Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on=
 Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is bes=
t used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Upda=
ted 11/20/01  Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the over=
time session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't c=

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there

McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us. I 
pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one flat 
tire in his suburban.
three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired. 
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone yard 
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other 7 
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said his 
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease. 
Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted 
lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a good 
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff was 
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to 
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his wife 
may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders. we'll 
have to fix them up on openning weekend.

Will the last brownie meeting be on the afternoon of May 9?  We have early 
dismissal that day.  The recognitions for the cookie sale may not be 
available until the evening of the 9th.  I've emailed the coordinator to see 
if we can get them earlier.

Thanks,

Susan"

I left my paperwork in the green box at your doorstep yesterday.  I wanted to 
make sure you received it.  I'll be out of town until March 25, so if you 
have any questions, I won't be able to respond until then.

Thanks,

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disg=
usted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrenc=
e.=20

I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC=
.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with=
 the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way a=
nd learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a=
 believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nose=
d, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and hel=
d on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometim=
es daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top execu=
tives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of r=
easons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compens=
ated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlement=
s, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in th=
e Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew so=
mething we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us=
 that Enron was going to be the ""World's Leading Company.""  He even put the=
 goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in Februa=
ry how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the c=
ynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was h=
opeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that =
high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e.,=
 +/- 20%. =20

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more option=
s.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afr=
aid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have ma=
ny working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my sa=
vings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their=
 entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking =
forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let m=
e remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less t=
han a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Ot=
her employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for t=
heir children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and=
 the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the =
industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeleton=
s in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees=
 and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumb=
o-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your co=
horts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending yo=
ur millions.....

I have discussed the warranty issue with my attorney and he suggested the 
following be used as Section 8.5.  The language in this section allows for 
gas from outside the state.  Please advise.

The following representations and warranties shall apply to Transactions 
under the stated conditions:  (i) if Company is Buyer, Seller represents and 
warrants to Buyer that all Gas will have been produced (a) within the state 
of Texas and will not have been commingled with other Gas which is or may be 
sold, consumed, transported or otherwise utilized in interstate commerce in 
such manner which would subject an intrastate Transporter to the jurisdiction 
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or any successor authority under 
the Natural Gas Act of 1938 or (b) outside of the state of Texas with any 
transportation on an interstate pipeline having been conducted under Section 
311 (a)(1) of the Natural Gas Policy Act and (ii) if Company is Seller and 
the Delivery Point(s) for the Transaction are not interstate 
interconnections, Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that none of the 
Gas will be sold, consumed, transported or otherwise utilized outside the 
state or sold to another party which will subsequently sell, consume, 
transport or otherwise use the Gas outside the State where such event would 
subject an intrastate Transporter to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission or any successor authority under the Natural Gas Act of 
1938.

Thank you for your e-mail.  Concerning Section 13.5, we will agree to New 
York on choice of law.  For Section 2.5, ENA as confirming party.  Finally, 
Section 3.2  we prefer Spot Price as this is a short term deal.

Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues.

DAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?
Daily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS 
By Emily Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas 
Back in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html>) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html>) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money. 
The question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?'']. 
Still, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder. 
CULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business. 
Although many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg. 
For the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron. 
``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli. 
That's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO John Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.'' 
Still, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons & Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.'' 
Some industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron? Don't bet the chalet on it.

Thanks for the message. PIRA doesn't have any relationships and/or
agreements with UBS Warburg.

I know Tim Belden in Portland wants to restore several services. Please let
me know the number of people (licensed users) and locations for each
retainer service so I can give you a quote for site licensing fees.

1299,"Hi Dutch --

Since you offered to answer some of my questions over e-mail, I will take
you up on it!    I would still like to get some of your time Monday or
Tuesday to go into more detailed discussion.

Question 1:
When we talk about ""the market"" reacting to events, what are the prices
that we are talking about? From a simulation standpoint, I am trying to
figure out what prices we need to show as being affected by these many
events.  Is it the forward curve? Is it the spot market price?  Is the
bid/offer prices for the various instruments? And, if we are having users
trade basis, we will need different prices for different locations, right?

Question 2:
Given that the calculation of VaR is rather involved, we decided that it
would not be worth our effort to have that calculation in the model.
However, we understand that the user needs to 1) know their VaR and 2) know
that they need to make sure they stay within their VaR limit.  So, we will
need to set a VaR limit for the user and ""fake"" the individual VaR to
reflect their risk exposure.

I had a talk with Erro McLaughlin about this.  He made a good point that if
our user are not expected to understand the complexity of how a VaR is
calculated, will they know how to control their VaR, i.e. if a user sees
that he is over his VaR limit, what should he do to get it back within the
limit.  Is is as simple as not being too long or too short? And if that is
the case, would it be sufficient to use position reports/tallies as a proxy
for risk exposure, instead of VaR?

One possible way to fake VaR may be to adjust the VaR number to reflect how
exposed the user is. So if they are X dollars long, they have a VaR of Y.
If they change their position so that they are now 1.5X long, they have a
VaR of 1.5Y.  Perhaps we can also throw in a factor that takes into account
market volatility.

What are your thoughts?


Lastly, when could you meet with me next week? I would really like to meet
on Tuesday, if possible.

Thanks so much for your time, Dutch.

Have a terrific weekend!
Ann

1305,"While our webserver up here hasn't been hammered yet, I've been concerned 
about similar issues (web hardware and administration) for awhile up here.  
Given that the web is our primary medium I agree with you and Tim that it's been 
neglected.  

Administration is an ongoing issue and I'm not sure what a good solution for this is,
but relying on Houston for this is not an option as far as I'm concerned (unless they
change their draconian policies).  At the moment Chris Wiebe is officially administrating
our web/file server, but I don't think this is where his interests lie, so I've been relying
on Colin for most day-to-day admin.  This isn't great since Colin is a contractor.  We should
definitely team up on this one as I don't think IIS administration is even a quarter-time job,
but it is vital.  I'm in a similar spot on SQL Server issues - Chris is the admin, but he's moving
more toward the development side of IT with each passing week.  

In terms of hardware, I've been in touch with Houston through Dan Dietrich and spoke
with a helpful individual who is responsible for web servers down there.  He sent me
the following documentation standard which I hope I forwarded onto you (as it's quite
good).  I'm pushing to move to the Houston standard for web servers which is two 
clustered pizza boxes (DL360s).    I just got the price quote for these and it would be 
about 9000 US$ for the two boxes (basically dual proc PIII 930, 512 MB RAM, 2 9GB drives)

You mentioned moving the dev environment from prod, but I'm not sure if you're interested
in splitting the web from the file server.  I think this is a good idea (more for file server reliability
than anything else.)  There's some time critical data up here that we can't recover if we 
miss it the first time, so I'm trying to make the backend as fault-tolerant as possible.  plus,
it seems like it's likely a cheap performance and fault tolerance boost for the web, as well.  

Sorry to hear about your web troubles yesterday, but hopefully it will serve as a catalyst
for us to clean things up.  

Should we set up a call to talk about this?

1322,"Just some shocking news about Enron's fundraising stars.  Would you believe 
this?

 Dan Lyons -  $8810
He's not too far from doubling what he raised last year, and he has three 
weeks to go.

Ray Sylvester - $6000  

Jordan Hunter - $4500
Another huge increase over last year

I hope this is incentive for all of us to get cracking - we have a larger 
goal this year - $350,000, but I know we can do it.  I know there are more 
good stories out there in the pledging jungle, so shoot me a note and let me 
know how you're doing.  

I want to tell you about a new friend of mine.  I met her just last weekend.  
She has MS, diagnosed in 1996.  She walks very slowly with a cane and needed 
help negotiating her way across a thin throw rug on the floor.  When she 
found out about our bike ride she pledged $500 to me and let me know how 
important this activity is to her.  Research is very important, client 
services to MS patients are very important - giving them hope is very 
important, and that's what we do when we're out there raising money for their 
future.

My new friend asked me to pass along
 to each and every one of you her very grateful appreciation for all you 
do.   

If you have any fundraising questions, or I can help you in any way - please 
give me a call at 713-646-6569.

bitch is nine. 
His mother heard what he was saying and gasped, ""What are you doing?"" 
The little boy answered, ""I'm doing my math homework, Mom."" 
""And this is how your teacher taught you to do it?"" the mother asked. 
""Yes,"" he answered. 
Infuriated, the mother asked the teacher the next day, ""What are you  teaching my son in math?"" 
The teacher replied, ""Right now, we are learning addition."" 
The mother asked ""And are you teaching them to say 'two plus two,  that son of a bitch is four'?"" 
After the teacher stopped laughing, she answered, ""What I taught them was  two plus two, THE SUM OF WHICH, is four.'""

B 1 (b):  I think the master gas contract form includes Affiliates on

If a Triggering Event occurs, the Notifying Party may (at its election) set 
off any or all amounts which the Affected Party owes to the Notifying Party 
or its Affiliates (under this Agreement or otherwise) against any or all 
amounts which the Notifying Party owes to the Affected Party (either under 
this Agreement or otherwise).

B 2 (f):  The analysis is based upon Enron default.  If counterparty default 
analysis is used, Enron benefits; and don't all contracts at least have all 
transactions terminating if bankruptcy is the triggering event?

Yoder to help out (general Enron thoughts) and Randy Osteen (Constellation)  
to speak about the EEI ""Into Product"" if the group wants to understand  a 
little of the history behind it and how the product works (Randy actively 
participated in the review and formulation of the Into Product as well.

Sorry again for missing the meeting.

Talk to you soon.

Give me a call on this - I was thinking either Marcus Nettelton or Carol St 
Clair in Houston could help you. Which one will depend in part on how you 
think the timing will go.

Hi Vicki
Hope you had a good holiday.  When we spoke yesterday, I think I gave you a wrong number for Grant - His work number is 713 522 6300 (ask for Grant Cox).  He is expecting your call around 500 and will meet you in front of the Frost Bank Building on Norfolk (across from the post office).  Ella also has a note for you with this information.  Talk to you soon and thanks again.

I have attached a detailed map of the ERCOT system, 69, 138 and 345 KV line and buses (*.pwd).   The map is based on the 2001 Summer peak load flow case. (Enron paid about $12,000 for this map so we do not need to disclose it to outside personnel.)

I also have a detailed map of the eastern interconnect, I believe it is down to the 138 KV level.

I have also attached a 2001 contingency file (*.ctg) for ease of importing a standard list of line contingencies that I obtained from the ISO.

I have also attached an ERCOT injection group (*.aux) , which is valuable for the years after 2001 because of one constrol group.

We are moving forward with pushing FERC as the ""right"" forum for the Civil

make sure that you realize the likelihood of success (not too optimistic 
about a complete victory).

Also, the key is to build the right set of allies in moving forward - we need 
Mirant and Reliant to carry as much if not more water on this fight - their 
access to right FERC staff and Commissioners is pretty good.

Also, want to talk with you about all of the FERC matters we have on-going.

1396,"Here are the changes I sent to Alan.

"
1397,"Hello AFAC and Marcelo:  Attached is a recent ""short list"" of possible 
products which our traders may be interested in trading in the near future.  
The list was created by Bruce Harris who resides in Houston but travels 
frequently to Brazil.  Bruce will join us by telephone next week.  
My goal is to discuss in depth the memo which you created on October 19, 
further research (specifically a memo regarding OTC swaps!) and Bruce's 
list.  Lynn Aven (tax) and Brent Hendry (legal in Argentina) will be present, 
as will Andrea Bertone.  We will conference in Bruce and possibly others from 
Houston.  This will be my last message from Houston as Enron will be closed 
later today for the Thanksgiving holiday and will reopen on Monday, November 
29.  I'll be in our Sao Paulo office that day.  I'm looking forward to our 
meeting on Tuesday, November 30 at 2 pm.  See you both soon.  Regards.  Sara
"
1398,"Some lawyers outside the swaps/Enron Net Works group are inquiring about 
attending the CFMA session we have scheduled with Ken Raisler for Monday, 
March 5th.   The CFMA raises a number of issues that are of interest 
throughout the Enron Wholesale Services legal department, and I think a 
presentation to the entire EWS group will probably be in order at some point.

However, I think it is important that we keep the March 5th session specific 
to the swaps/Enron Net Works group.  This is meant to be more of a 
question-and-answer ""workshop"" session rather than a ""big-picture"" 
presentation of the new law.   My concern is that if too wide a variety of 
questions and issues are raised, we will not have enough time to focus on the 
detailed financial trading issues and the appropriate form changes we need to 
discuss with Ken.

Please help me in keeping attendance at the appropriate level so that we may 
have a productive and focused session.  Thank you -- Bob

All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM: Michael Campanelli, Vice President
  Floor Operations, COMEX Division

RE:  Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day


Please be reminded that Thursday, May 31, 2001, is the First Notice Day, for
the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of June 2001
(the new spot month).

On Wednesday, May 30, 2001, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all Brokers and
Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"")
system trained representative available until such time as the Exchange
deems necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a
diligent effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to show due
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061."

counterparties for which we require legal opinions and the whole ball of wax, 
so to speak, including background documentation, resolutions, etc.  If we 
cannot prove authority to transact, then the agreement may not be enforceable 
(i.e., if the counterparty owes us money, we may not be able to collect).  We 
definitely need to review certified copies of  the counterparty's charter, 
enabling statutes or legislation creating or authorizing the counterparty, 
its bylaws, charter or constituent docs, investment policies, guidelines or 
restrictions, resolution approving the swap (or other) transactions and 
authorizing a person(s) to transact,etc AND a legal opinion (the format of 
which we always provide to the counterparty).    It's best to execute the 
ISDA but we do have an omnibus drafted for municipalities.  Call if you need

I spoke earlier with Rick Hopkinson who indicated that the account will

We need to verify a few details (account party, purpose, resolutions, 
authorized trader list, etc.).  Also, will the broker be Morgan?
Nancy, since you will be working on the authorizations, please keep in mind 
that Ted Murphy will limit authorized traders to the Houston equity 
traders(and perhaps Bruce) for control purposes.  I believe we had to change 
the Enron Brazil Power Holding XII Ltd. resolutions in that regard.  I'll 
verify.

lodge the physical securities at MS (in the vault) for the account of 
Enron....Holdings XII with a stock power from PEP.  Are we headed in the same 
direction here?  SS
"
1448,"Morgan Stanley has advised me this morning of the following with respect to 
accounts:

1.  The name of the account must be identical to the name of the certificate 
holder.
2.  An account holding only a certificate(s) is subject to a minimum equity 
requirement of USD 500,000.

As the certificate holder is the Brazilian company PEP, the broker will 
require additonal equity.  I am still awaiting a broker response as to 
whether the certificate holder can execute a stock power in favor of the 
account holder thereby enabling us to lodge the certificate(s) in the 
existing (Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII) account.   Alternatively, the 
certificate(s) can be held in the Enron Corp. vault. 

Robert, when do you need to respond to BONY?

the office.  FYI:
NTAP closed at 188-3/4 and CISCO closed at 132-3/16.  It's too early for the 
mutual fund reports.  The weather is again gorgeous; we had empanadas for 
lunch and they were much better than tamales.  I read the tamale article in 
the Oxford American and it talked about the tamale man in Greenville, MS 
(whose name was Six Sixty-Six, being the sign of the devil so the tamales 
were really HOT).  Tomorrow we meet with another law firm.  Thursday and 
Friday I meet with the commercial people about ISDA agreements and one 
business customer is flying in from the province of Mendoza to discuss an 
agreement.  I'll call you later and I'm going to try to go to bed earlier 
tonight (I'll try to call after 9pm BA time).  Love, the DG"
1474,"I hope you are doing well.  I finally have my laptop so I can at least read 
email during the day.  The weather here is gorgeous.  It's about 72 during 
the day and cooler at night.  We went to a restaurant that had a ""tunnel of 
fudge"" por d'creme.  Someone at the table said there is a similar recipe in 
the Charlie Trotter cookbook.  Do you have that cookbook?  I know you have a 
lot of them.  I fly hime Friday night and arrive in Houston on Saturday 
morning at 6:30 am.  Mike should be waiting for me at my house and I can't 
wait to see the Phoebe and sports dog a/k/a Chloe.  How's mother and daddy?

EOTT (I think EOTT documents its financial deals separately)

I believe that the best direct jet service between Houston and Charlotte is via US AIr.  Continental has fewer flights and uses other carriers (unfamiliar to me).

1536,"Hello All -- Just and update on the Chicago Deal.  
 The ordinance which would permit the City to enter into a multi-year 
agreement was introduced in the City Council yesterday and the Mayor held a 
post-Council press conference with our deal being the first issue addressed 
(and the only one to have a nice graphic showing its benefits).  Several 
high-profile issues were also on the agenda (racial profiling, redistricting, 
legal representations for aldermen re: school locations, school board CEO 
Paul Vallas' future, Gery Chico's replacement, etc.) so the press spent 
several minutes questioning both the Mayor and City Commissioner Bill Abolt 
on our issue.  Abolt did a masterful job of handling the issue with his point 
being that the City has lived up to its commitment to 1) develop a 
competitive market, 2) reduce costs while, 3) promoting green power 
(renewables).  The press focused on whether ComEd was resentful that 60% of 
the City's requirements will be covered by this agreement to which Mr. Dwyer, 
of ComEd, after the press conference stated that they viewed the deal as a 
win because ComEd got the green component of the City's business.  Peggy 
Mahoney also made a post conference statement and was welcomed by the press 
and was given a favorable treatment by the press (Dick Kay, Andy Shaw and 
Mike Flannery).  
 On balance, I think that the press did not know what to make of this deal 
but knew that this is an appropriate response to the drubbing the Mayor has 
received in the past for putting all of the City's energy needs in one basket 
laid at the feet of ComEd.  As you know, this is only the introduction of our 
deal to the City Council and it has not been approved yet.  We expect that 
that will occur either later in June or certainly by the end of July.  The 
actual contract will be finalized and signed at that time.  In the mean time, 
I expect that the press will have more questions as this matter moves forward 
and it goes to the Council's Energy Committee.  The City is doing the heavy 
lifting and it is best that Enron not take an over large profile -- but we 
also cannot become invisible either.  Julie Starsiak of Ronan & Potts and 
Peggy Mahoney are very much involved.

Of the group who went to GW, several employees who had not been in the Hill for the last week were told by the doctor that they did not need to be tested.  The following employees were tested:  John Shelk, Pat Shortridge, Chris Long, Steve Burns, Allison Hamilton, Larry Decker, Carolyn Cooney, Carin Nersesian, and myself.

Democracy: You have two cows. The government taxes
you to the  point that you must sell them both to
support a man in a foreign country who  has only one
cow, which was a gift from your own  government.

Corporation: You have two cows. You lay one off,
force the  other to produce the milk of four cows, then
act surprised when it drops  dead.

California: You have two cows. The state tells you how
to milk  your cows, when to milk your cows, how much to
milk your cows and the most  that you can charge for the
milk. You go broke and sell the cows. The state  calls you
greedy and blames you for the current milk shortage.  "
1542,"Rick, as I mentioned to you last week, I would like you to help to organise 
the visit of two italian officials this summer. The first one is

- Mauro Formaggio (Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory 
Authority)

I have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past 
re. UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA. He is now working on 
the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market, and he is asking if he 
could meet someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of 
a big pipeline (despatching operation, commercial scheduling of transmission, 
nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the 
pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities). Please, 
see this e-mail below. He has not yet decided the dates, but he is aiming at 
last week of August, for 1/2 days. 

I would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation 
who could help on this, and I would co-ordinate Formaggio's meeting.


Alfredo,
I'm scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA. in the month
of August.
The aspects I'm considering are:
- how OBAs are organized and how they are applied,
- the operation of hubs,
- the balancing penalties,
- the trading of capacity
- the general operation of a (big) pipeline
- the general operation of a state pipeline, and of a LDC
- the operation of a shipper
Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your
american colleagues on any of these items.

1545,"Tim

I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may 
help you prepare for Thursday.

Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this 
production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily 
load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 
55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal 
differences in load.

Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However 
these states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume 
more gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the 
regional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and 
move gas to the areas of greatest demand.

Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if 
the daily production is growing or shrinking.  

Very simplistic, but maybe it helps.

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT 


Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a ""material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" it warned.

Sorry for the delay - I'm still trying to track this down.  Obviously I don't 
know the answer right off and no one I've asked so far knows for sure 
(although those who know a little something about the area don't think it 
looks good).  I hope to have a final answer for you early next week.

Mark

1604,"Mark, the following tax changes to the various financial GTC's and weather 
swaps are those that we have spoken about and effectively adopt the approach 
of our Master ISDA's with regard to taxation.  Just wanted to keep you in the 
loop.  I will be out on Tuesday but, should you need to, you can follow up 
with Jeff Blumenthal.  Best regards.
"
1605,"We are getting very excited about the BVI.  It's hard to believe it's only 5 
weeks away.  I try to think about it whenever the stock market gets me 
depressed (which is happening with altogether too much frequency these 
days).  I see you guys got hit with a triple whammy today.  Oh well, can you 
say ""buying opportunity""?

I'm coming to NYC for a conference in a couple of weeks - any chance you guys 
are free for dinner on Sunday the 31st?  We also need to talk about $ 
sometime soon since I made the final payment on the boat a couple of weeks 
ago.  Have you made your hotel arrangements (we still have a room reserved 
for you for the night of the 20th which you won't need if you've made other 
arrangements - and we can always get you a room there for the last night if 
you want)?   And there's still the beverage list (you did get my fax, didn't 
you?).  

T. sends regards.  Hope you're well and not letting the market roller-coaster 
get you down (my mantra is ""think long term, think long term, think long 
term"").

Mark"
1606,I hope you've had the VCR going.
1607,"Dave, attached is our settled form of product description and GTC we have 
prepared for a HDD Australian weather swap. The GTC has been prepared on the 
basis that the GTCs will apply even in instances where there is a Master 
Agreement with the counterparty.     

Susan/Heidi - I  would also like a specific sign off from someone (presumably 
Price WaterhouseCoopers) that the input tax status of commodity derivatives 
(as outlined in the Australian Tax Office Consultation Paper on the 
application of GST to financial services) will extend to weather derivatives.

We are preparing similar documentation for the following, HDD swap, HDD Call 
Option, HDD Put Option, CDD Swap, CDD Call Option and CDD Put Option.

Interested in any feedback.

1623,"Hello Everyone,

	We had a few upsets this week, with some games missed by quite a few people. No one correctly picked Georgia
defeating #7 Tennessee. Oklahoma/TX game was mixed, many people missed Ohio St. beating Northwestern and the only non-top 25 game was mixed, with many people taking Southern Miss, as Memphis won 22-17. In the pros, many people picked Atlanta over the Bears incorrectly, San Diego over Cleveland was missed by most people, Arizona upsetting the Eagles was not good for just about everyone, Seattle beating Jacksonville was not picked by most people and Tampa Bay defeating Green Bay was also missed by most. Through all that, Joe Step did only get 5 incorrect picks and has won this weeks pool already. I came close with 6 wrong, but we both have St. Louis tonight. We had 33 entries this week, the most we've ever had, even back to last season, good job!! Therefore Joe won $66. Below is each person with the number of games they missed this week.

1675,"I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow."

1710,"Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

1714,"Paul,
I have been doing some analysis and have found a few problems that should be looked at.

1.  The number Mother data is pulling for Zone P is wrong.  The pointer for the data can be found on the SQL worksheet the expression is:
	  avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'DAYAHEAD', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_DA,
and	  avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'HOURLY', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_RT,

I have looked at the PJM and NY prices and am unable to figure out where the number is coming from.

2.  The other 24hr desk evidently has been told that the PJM night shift is to prep the PJM and Nepool portions of the shift notes.  That is fine with me.  I wrote a macro to pull, format and print the Nepool information.  The PJM information is not available on the website.  The East power portal has something.  I think it does some kind of Op Sum pull at some unknown interval.  The problem is the information is not accurate.  

Rob Bensen's frustration with this bad information is the main reason the other 24hr desk doesn't want any part of the reporting.

2.a All data points are different than the one hour averages calculated in edata.  This makes me doubt that opsum is the source, as edata also pulls from opsum.

2.b When all interfaces and hubs are printing the same, the prices shown differ in the same hour on the website.  I have no idea where this information is coming from but it is not right.  If the correct data can be found there is an application that pulls from the database at ""M:\Electric\24hour\PJM AVE\PJMSummary.exe"".  If they could fix this app I would care less about the web site.  If they do not want to fix the app I can write a macro to pull the same data from the mother data template.  I don't really care how I get the data, I just need to get yesterday's PJM for the shift note.

In other news, if you are trading some of the regular products, are you following the DA-RT physical moves?  If we do man the 24hr desk (even if Bryce is the day guy) we could cover the DA-RT physical.  Having it part of the 24hr desk would seem to make sense because the evening load and more up to date weather forecasts could be used when entering the NY side in the early morning.

I only mention this if you are finding yourself too busy trading PJM to spend the same amount of time on the analysis.  It is certainly easier to do uninterrupted analysis on the back shift.  Just a thought.

Thanks,
David"

1737,"Aaron,
The house we live in is about 1700 Sq foot.. older home that needed some fixing up.  At the time I thought we paid too much, however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home.  The Houston Texans (a very original name) have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake.  Also, they have totally redone South Main Blvd creating a nice thoroughfare. The area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood!  However, home values go up and down just like the stock market.  Most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable there.

When we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare, I think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job.  I prefer to do it myself, I like the way it looks when I do it and it is whole lot cheaper.  One day the contractor almost died in the house... he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of Advil to ease the pain; however he did this on an empty stomach.  He had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week!  He ended up returning and finishing the job?!?!  Anyways, I have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time I will have a better idea on how to get things done.  It was hard to organize and quality assure the job since I had just started a demanding job here at Enron.  All in all, I think France or US you run into the same types of problems with contractors.  

Talking about wild flowers and plants.. the same is true for Costa Rica.   Plants that only grow indoors with great care in Houston grow like weeds in Costa Rica.  I recommend that on your places to go list.

TO: Existing Firm Transportation Shippers

RE: Offers For Permanent Relinquishment of Firm Capacity in
Conjunction with the Leidy East Expansion Project



Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (""Transco"") solicits offers
for the permanent relinquishment of firm transportation
capacity on the Transco system. Shippers holding capacity
with receipts at Leidy, PA and deliveries to Princeton
Junction or mainline points in Zone 6 may offer that
capacity for relinquishment, subject to the
conditions outlined below.


Transco intends to combine such relinquished capacity
with newly constructed capacity in order to render service
in Transco's Leidy East Expansion Project (""Leidy East"").
In accordance with the Commission's order of April 26, 2001
denying Transco's request for clarification of the MarketLink
Order, the Leidy East project will provide service to
shippers that had executed contracts that were filed with
the Commission on April 13, 2001, as part of Phase 3 of the
MarketLink project.  The capacity of the Leidy East project
will be 130,000 Dts/d.  In order to meet the proposed in-
service date of November 1, 2002, Transco plans to file
a certificate application with the Commission for Leidy
East by the end of June.



Offers for capacity relinquishment may be made by
shippers with existing transportation services as defined
above and provided under Part 284(G) of the FERC's
regulations.

Valid offers must meet the following criteria:

1. The capacity offered must result in a reduction of the
facilities otherwise required to serve the subscribing
shippers in Leidy East;

2. Inclusion of relinquished capacity in the project must
result in a lower cost of service for the project than if
additional facilities were constructed;

3. The remaining contract term for the relinquished
capacity must not exceed the primary contract term of
service for Leidy East;

4. Offers for permanent relinquishment will not be
accepted from shippers who have contracted for service
under Leidy East;

5. Offers must identify the specific contract(s) and delivery
point(s) in each contract at which delivery point entitlements
(DPEs)will be reduced as a result of the relinquishment of firm
capacity to those points; and

6. Offers must be unconditional, binding and irrevocable.

Such offers must be received by Transco no later than 5:00
PM CST on Monday, May 21, 2001. After receipt of offers to
relinquish capacity, Transco will make any modifications
necessary to the design of the facilities to be constructed
to render service in Leidy East.

Parties that submit offers to relinquish capacity will be
notified as to whether the offer complied with the
specifications set forth herein and whether the capacity
will be accepted and utilized to render service in Leidy East.
If more capacity is offered than is needed in Leidy East,
preference will be given to those offers which reduce the
cost of Leidy East to the greatest degree. In the event of
a tie, preference will next be given to those offers which
have the shortest remaining term for the capacity
relinquished.

Shippers with relinquished capacity that is included in
Leidy East will retain all rights and responsibilities set forth
in their Service Agreement(s), Rate Schedule FT and the General
Terms and Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff until
Leidy East firm transportation service commences through the
relinquished capacity.  The Leidy East firm transportation
service is expected to commence on November 1, 2002.
The relinquishing shipper's service agreement(s) will be
terminated or reduced effective on the actual in service date.
Transco's acceptance of relinquished capacity is and will be
subject to the following:

1. Execution and delivery by the shipper to Transco of an
agreement to permanently relinquish such firm transportation
capacity (such agreement to be provided by Transco);

2. Execution and delivery of an amendment to the shipper's firm
transportation contract reflecting any modifications resulting
from the relinquishment of a portion of the service related to
such capacity, if applicable;


3. Receipt of a FERC certificate authorizing the proposed
Leidy East facilities and service (including approval of this
capacity relinquishment) in a form acceptable to Transco in its
sole opinion.


In the event that Leidy East does not go forward for any reason,
including, without limitation, the FERC authorizations being
granted in a form unacceptable to Transco, the capacity
relinquishment shall not be effectuated and all related
agreements shall be null and void.

Parties desiring more information regarding this announcement
should contact Nancy Hargrove at 713-215-2926.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Press Release
SOURCE: Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. 
Maritimes Files Application for Phase IV Expansion Of Natural Gas Pipeline System
BOSTON, Feb. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. has submitted an application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to further expand its natural gas pipeline system. The $250 million expansion project, designated Phase IV, will allow Maritimes to nearly double its capacity to transport natural gas from offshore Nova Scotia to markets in the northeastern United States from approximately 415,000 dekatherms to 800,000 dekatherms per day. 
Demand for natural gas, especially in New England and the Northeast, continues to increase at a rapid rate. Maritimes received substantial requests for transportation services from local natural gas distribution companies, natural gas-fired electric generators and third-party marketers during a recently completed open season nominations period, emphasizing the market's desire for more natural gas from Atlantic Canada. 
``The demand for natural gas is real, and it is significant,'' said Tom O'Connor, president of M&N Management Co., the managing member of Maritimes. ``Maritimes is able to respond to the demand by efficiently and economically expanding its system to deliver new supplies of gas from fields off Canada's east coast. Access to additional sources of this cleaner-burning fuel will ensure greater energy reliability and flexibility for the northeast region.'' 
Earlier this year, Maritimes signed agreements with PanCanadian Energy Services Inc. to transport up to approximately 400 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from PanCanadian's Deep Panuke project, offshore Nova Scotia. The Phase IV expansion project will accommodate the increased volumes of gas. 
The Phase IV expansion complements the planned extension of the Maritimes pipeline from Methuen to Beverly, Mass. The extension -- Phase III of the Maritimes project -- will interconnect the 650-mile Maritimes pipeline with Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.'s 1,000-mile system through Algonquin's proposed HubLine project. The Maritimes Phase III and Algonquin HubLine projects recently received final approval from FERC. 
The Phase IV project proposes to construct four compressor stations in Maine each with approximately 26,800 horsepower of additional compression and approximately 31.3 miles of additional pipeline loop facilities in Maine's Washington County. The new compressor stations are proposed to be located in the municipalities of Eliot, Gorham, Brewer and Searsmont. Maritimes recently held open houses in these communities to provide information on the proposed expansion. 
``We will work closely with federal, state and municipal officials as well as landowners and stakeholders throughout the FERC process to ensure the project is designed and constructed with minimal impact to communities and the environment,'' said Bill Penney, senior vice president and general manager of Maritimes. ``As we proceed with the Phase IV expansion, Maritimes will continue its solid record of environmental, safety and operational compliance.'' 
In addition to the FERC application, Maritimes will submit applications to other appropriate federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Coastal Zone Management and Maine Department of Environmental Protection. The Phase IV expansion is expected to be in service in 2004. 
Maritimes is owned by affiliates of Duke Energy (37.5 percent); Westcoast Energy, Inc. (37.5 percent); ExxonMobil (12.5 percent); and Emera Inc. (12.5 percent). For more information, contact Maritimes on the Internet at www.mnp-usa.com <http://www.mnp-usa.com>.

Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the ""e mail"" I received in 
case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all 
off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  

It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It 
was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be 
even better!  

I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers 
today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have 
to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If 
I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have 
said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  
Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its 
something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything 
about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell 
everyone.

Im looking forward to Friday night!
Don't forget your number for roulette.

We tried to get SDG&E to discuss these proposed changes with us, but they 
have not called us back.  Tracy put the credit terms together some time ago 
so please check to see if these need to be revised.  If so, get aSHari to put 
the revised terms into the red lined version.  Our changes are fairly 
significant.  It is highly unlikely that they would agree to these terms
