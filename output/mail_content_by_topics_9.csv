4,"Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802

CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Thank you for meeting with us today. I want to take a few minutes to
summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.

1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions you
gave us and move forward with this approach.

2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for Topics
reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for
sign-off on each topic.

3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to
incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We will
meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've
designed them so far and arrive at a solution. (I will send an e-mail
Monday with the room number.)

Have a good weekend.

Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a 
big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.

Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent 
you this morning.

23,"Background

As you may remember, in September John Miller called to find out if we want to sell Willow Farms.  At that time, I told him I would find out from the group.

In December, he called again, and we missed one another, but I finally told, via voicemail, that we would entertain and consider and offer to buy Willow Farms but that we would not consider any kind of partnership or joint venture and we wanted a straight sale.  I then told him that if he was still interested that he should give it his best shot, and we would consider whatever he sent us.

My Discussion of 1/30/02

John called me back on 1/17/02, and I returned his call today.  I told John the following:

1.  The group is still interested in whatever he would propose, but I wanted to make some things clear so he didn't think we were wasting his time.

2.  I told him that in reality, all don't want to sell, but 2 out of 3 do, and I won't stand in the way of a satisfactory sale.

3.  We still do not want to participate in any development or sale, the price cannot be dependent on success of sales and a sale must be all or nothing.  I told him that I could not agree to any sale that allowed a ""cherry picking"" of good lots and left other lots behind, because once sales started it puts pressure to complete the development or else all prices suffer under perception of ""undesirable"" development.

4.  I told him that the only reason we are having this discussion now is that due to the property tax revaluations the carrying costs of the lots has increased.  Therefore, any sale must be structured to take that carrying cost pressure off, hence, a sale of all or nothing.

After stating these ground rules, I told him that I would understand if he wasn't interested, but that if he was, he should just give us his ""best"" proposal.

He then asked how many lots, and I told him 8 with a 9th possible, but owned only by my mom.  He said let's keep that out for now.  I also told him that within the next 2 years, the lot with the house might also be sold, but that that was up to my parents.

He then said the following:

1.  He is interested too in reducing his risk, so he might be interested in deal where he would guarantee the purchase of 2 lots every year for 4 years.  It would be a guarantee.

2.  He asked me if we had any idea of the value we wanted for the lots.  I said there are different ideas and no consensus, so I said I had no number to give him.  I reiterated to him that he knows more than me (since I'm just a lawyer in Denver) and he should give it his best shot.

I then commented to him on his suggestion:

1.  I told him that any deal that did not ensure sale of all lots was just not acceptable, so the extent of his guarantee of 2 lots per year had to be firm as to 8 lots over 4 years to even be considered.  I told him then it would appear just to be a means of financing the sale (not reducing his risk) and allowing us to keep title to the unsold lots rather than tie them up with a mortgage.

2.  I told him that his proposal may not be worth considering if it allowed the kind of cherry picking I referred to above and the kind of pressure to pick up the remaining lots at lower prices that I referred to above. I told him to consider these concerns in his proposal.

3.  I told him that because what brought us to the table now is the increased carrying costs of the lots, any proposal by him that still puts pressure on us to carry these lots and expend finds, will not be well received.  For example, I told him that I have some concern that any 2 lot per year deal will result in immediately increased carrying costs resulting from revaluation of the remaining lots for property tax purposes based upon the first purchases.  I told him that that would not be well received by us.

How We Ended It

I told him that I wanted to make clear my concerns so that he doesn't waste his time and feel resentful if we reject his offer. I told him that I wanted to be above board and that my reputation was important to me. He said he understood and appreciated the details.

He said he will put a proposal together, and I told him to send it to Leonard at the office, since I am not good at being the middleman.

Let me know if I goofed up or did ok.

Thank you for signing your petition to certify the election

Like many Americans, I'm sure you're trying to get the most
accurate, up-to-the-minute information about what's
happening down in Florida.  But can you really trust the
information you get from the liberal media?

In fact, the liberal media has been behind this election
controversy from the beginning.

That's why I'm passing on to you this letter I received
from my friend Jim Roberts at Radio America.

Radio America is doing something about this attempt by the
liberal media to hijack the election.  I urge you to take
just a minute to read Jim's letter and to listen to Radio
America over the internet for unbiased election coverage.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Chris Warren , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Warren arrived in Philadelphia on Friday, and practiced with the Eagles on 
Saturday. Although he hasn't had a lot of time to get familiar with the 
offensive scheme, he could get some action against Cleveland on Sunday. We 
wouldn't recommend starting him during the Fantasy playoffs this week, 
however.  

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Snake Pit Updated 12/10/00 
 Although Watters didn't practice all week because of a bad case of turf toe, 
Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said he will start Sunday against Denver. Watters 
is not on the injury report and medical reports say the toe is fine.  

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Mean Machine Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - FDIC Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Brian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale.  Coach 
Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning 
to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23.  Fantasy owners should look 
elsehwere for a Fantasy QB.  Griese hasn't played in almost a month.  A 
player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team.      

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that 
have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to 
be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible.  

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar 
has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards 
and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four 
games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to 
Fantasy owners in deeper leagues.   

 Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them 
going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also 
dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up 
against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much 
as a result.  

 James Thrash , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the 
Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, 
so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league 
uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three 
man.   

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more 
than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games 
prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by 
being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take 
this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over 
the final two games.  

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win 
over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.   

 Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run 
a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy 
value at this point in the season.   

 Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He 
missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year 
career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't 
start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the 
Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being 
bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in 
your Fantasy season.   

 Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He 
rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was 
walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to 
play next Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 James McKnight , WR DAL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 
 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in 
two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback 
situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea.   

 R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several 
team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made 
several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a 
October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder 
of the season.  

 Larry Centers , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' 
Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk.   

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Klap Updated 12/11/00 
 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, 
allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the 
Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by 
this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of 
injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati 
next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs.  

 Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 
carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks 
to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point.   

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 
 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing 
for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a 
touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm 
is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to 
try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as 
Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.   

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 
 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 
346 yards.  Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from 
the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week.  If you are one 
of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to 
Fantasy glory.   

 Jeff George , QB WAS - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this 
week's game against Dallas.  The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 
passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the 
starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday 
against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins 
this week.    

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 
 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns.  He 
gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards.  With his 
performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back.   
 

 Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Top Dogs Updated 12/11/00 
 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also 
bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers 
are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team 
when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday.  

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 
 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams.  He 
will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter 
will be up for the task.  He struggled in their first meeting but still 
managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown.    

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game 
against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went 
down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving 
Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in 
the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' 
quarterbacks all together.   

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game 
against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven 
carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the 
game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of 
the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy 
value to help you at this important stage of the season.   

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday.  Look for 
Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week.  He had six catches 
for 130 yards in their first meeting this season.    

 Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three 
opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, 
could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham 
(groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. 
Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should 
hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a 
better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' 
D this week.   

 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Culpepper completed 21-of-33 passes for 221 yards and three touchdowns in a 
losing cause Sunday.  He also added an eight-yard scoring run of his own.  
Although the Vikings struggled as a team Sunday Culpepper will continue to 
help Fantasy owners for the duration of the season.    

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Coach Dick LeBeau was impressed enough with Mitchell's performance on Sunday 
against Tennessee that he named him the starting quarterback next Sunday 
against Jacksonville. The veteran QB was 12-for-26 passing for 131 yards with 
no touchdowns or interceptions, and was sacked four times. Mitchell should 
still be nowhere near your roster during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Brad Daluiso , K NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Daluiso ws good on all three of his field goal attempts on Sunday, 
converting from 38, 40 and 21 yards against Pittsburgh. He has now been 
successful on 12 consecutive attempts dating back to Week Seven against New 
York's next opponent, the Dallas Cowboys. Unless you have one of the league's 
top-notch kickers, starting Daluiso is a solid choice.    

 Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 
 Ismail seemed to be much more in synch with quarterback Trent Dilfer during 
Sunday's game against San Diego. He had six catches for 80 yards and a 
touchdown, a 28-yarder the two call a ""slugo"" (slant and go). Although it 
looked for a bit like Ismail wasn't worth a look during your playoffs, he 
could finally be at the point where he'll give you good numbers. Give him 
consideration next Sunday when he faces Arizona.

48,"Hi Folks, 
?
Just a few quick notes on this short Thanksgiving  week.
?
?
?
No Problems for Faulk / Kurt Warner  One more Week:? From USA Today's?Ram's 
Page:? ""In other  injury news, Marshall Faulk experienced no problems with 
his right knee the day  after the game. Martz said quarterback Kurt Warner 
almost certainly would miss  one more game before returning from a broken 
little finger on his throwing hand.  Two pins were removed from Warner's 
finger Monday and he'll throw Wednesday  through Friday in practice, but will 
not take any snaps. ''(The doctors) want  him to have another week before 
that hand is jarred by anything, just to make  sure it sets real well,'' 
Martz said. 
?
It should be noted that Warner is more optimistic  about playing than his 
coach is.? Don't take the coach's word as  gospel.? Remember, it was Martz 
who?a few days ago?was saying  Faulk likely wouldn't play Monday night and if 
he did, he'd be very  limited.? I'm not saying he's less than truthful.? I'm 
saying these  things change.? If I had to guess though, I'd say it's one more 
week of  Trent Green.
?
?
?
Tony Horne Out 6 Weeks:? From  USA Today: Tony Horne will be sidelined an 
estimated six weeks with a ligament  damage to his left big toe. Coach Mike 
Martz described the injury Tuesday as  ''severe turf toe.''? He'll likely be 
replaced by CB Dre Bly.
?
?
Ray Crockett Hamstring:?  Denver CB Ray Crockett tore his hamstring Sunday.? 
You may have seen it  when he went down and Ryan Leaf was able to hit Jeff 
Graham for the long  TD.? It looked pretty bad.? I thought he'd dislocated 
his hip the way  he pulled up.? Jimmy Spencer will fill in.?That hurts as the 
team gets  ready for Seattle.? The Seahawks are no passing juggernaut but 
neither were  the Chargers...
?
?
Mike Alstott Done? Tampa Bay  is calling Mike Alstott's knee injury a 3rd 
degree sprain of the medial  collateral ligament (MCL) and he'll likely miss 
6-8 weeks which of course means  he's done for FF purposes.? His leg is being 
placed in a cast for 10  days.? Surgery doesn't look to be required and it's 
a tough blow for the  big guy.? Look for more carries from Warrick Dunn.
?
?
Curtis Martin  Questions?? I've had a ton of requests for more info on the  
Curtis Martin situation which is now being called a hip injury instead of a  
lower back injury.? Coach Al Groh is being his usual guarded self with the  
""if he plays he plays"" type comments.? We'll know more here soon and will  
shoot it to you.? 
?
?
Scott Mitchell  Improving??? CBS Sportsline is reporting Scott  Mitchell's 
sprained knee is improving.?? He's listed as doubtful but  is reportedly 
making good progress.? With visions of Akili Smith in their  heads, I'm sure 
he's getting lots of encouragement.? Seems weird to be  getting excited about 
Scott Mitchell but the truth is he looked pretty good  Sunday.? His play was 
great news for Peter Warrick fans.? He makes  Corey Dillon better too.
?
?
Jeff George to Start??  Coach Norv Turner said today that unless Brad 
Johnson's knee is 100% healthy,  Jeff George would start.? Most reports are 
that Johnson's knee is not 100%  yet.? One more great game from George and 
this will be very  interesting.
?
?
Donald Hayes 50/50??  KFFL.com is reporting George Seifert said that WR 
Donald Hayes is questionable  for this week's game with a bad groin.?RB 
Tshimanga Biakabutuka is still  hobbled with a bad foot so the Panthers can 
ill afford to lose Hayes  too.
?
?
James Stewart Hopeful??  KFFL.com is reporting: ""James Stewart (hip pointer) 
and Mario Bates (knee) were  wearing red jerseys during Monday's practice. 
Red jerseys mean the players  aren't allowed to be hit. Lions head coach Gary 
Moeller stated he thinks Stewart  will be able to play Thursday against the 
Patriots. 
?
?
?
These are just a few quick ones for you.?  We'll have our full blown Players 
in the News Wednesday night.? See you  then.
?
Joe

I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions 
on EOL ""Force Majeure"" language.  Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon 
Katy Plant and were wondering the ""Force Majeure"" ramifications of the the 
Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that 
instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language?  
Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool 
and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these 
pooling zones.  

I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this 
information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.


Thanks in advance.

The meeting arose out of a need to identify where clearing needs to be in the 
future.  Legal will address
the legal implications of confirming web based deals.  It was rumored at one 
time that the web based receipt  was sufficient for confirmation of the 
deal.  

This issue as well as many others will be discussed.

Clearing users from London, Calgary, and Houston will have a chance to 
present their requirements. These requirements will  include
a need for web based clearing,  the nature of which  Commodity Logic is 
developing.  We are currently working closely with the Commodity Logic 
project  in
order to assure that the entire process of clearing deals as it exists today  
can be made as efficient as possible.

Web based clearing will be one of many requirements we hope to flush out 
during these meetings,  Based on the requirements we will
work with London to develop a plan that get us where we need to be.

Thanks for the invite, I will try and make it.

78,"While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.  ","Lexi Elliott Shelley Jones Lexi Shelley James Scribner Shelley

ISSUE

The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure=20
(OBSF) pre year-end to meet Enron requirements for gearing ratios.

Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being=
=20
bearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value o=
f=20
which depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given t=
he=20
hard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially=
=20
took place on spreadsheets.

The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business=20
should not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on=20
balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement=
s,=20
particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in=
=20
the AS400. With the specified functionality it is believed that all=20
operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed=20
satisfactorily.

The core functionality, which was due prior to the year-end, was released=
=20
during January but was subsequently found to have introduced =01+bugs=01, t=
o the=20
integrated business control processes. Whilst an improvement on having no=
=20
OBSF functionality, the =01+bugs=01, have had an increasingly negative effe=
ct on=20
the control environment, compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a=
=20
guaranteed delivery for the =01+bug=01, fixes and non core =01,reporting=01=
,=20
functionality.

This has given rise to the following concerns:

? There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at =
a=20
brand & location level to coordination records (the global position is=20
reconciled however).
? It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM&CL as:
? a) P&L on spread moves from Cash to 3 months positions (and related cash =
to=20
3 months provisions) can not be produced by the system and must be estimate=
d,=20
and
? b) System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values.

These concerns are compounded by the following:

? The most experienced AS400 IT developer for the EM&CL business has=20
resigned. He is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in=

July 2001.
? The most experienced AS400 IT developer on the EML side of the business h=
as=20
also resigned. He left in January 2001.=20
? There is no documentation for the AS400. It is therefore difficult for=20
experienced AS400 programmers to get upto speed on the system.

Conclusion

It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the=20
AS400 system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays. The=

83,"Accomplishments:
Conducted several workshops with EECC and the CALME region this week
Scheduled workshops with NEPCO
Have identified the needs to be addressed in the NEPCO workshops and are 
arranging appropriate resources
Met with the London COE to discuss their status in terms of reporting (we are 
sharing data from workshops)
Have made an initial offer to Corp HR cost center users to conduct workshops 
for them
Brought in some EY help to work with the business units to understand the 
multiple environments, extraction and analysis tools being used by the 
different business units

Upcoming:
Additional workshops for EECC and ESA
Identification of the Corp groups that would like to have these sessions made 
available (and subjects they would like to cover)
Will complete the ""user"" guides with screen prints to give out to all 
participants (step by step instructions, tools, and tips)
Finalize the NEPCO workshops (Mar 20-22)
Produce a plan for upcoming workshops for ECCS and Design review


Summary analysis of evaluations from this week's workshops:
Our overall belief is that the workshops, the one on one attention, the new 
content etc. are being received very well (scores averages around 3.5 on a 
scale of 1-4)
The score for the question of whether SAP will meet the reporting needs is 
still too low (average of 2.8).  We will continue to analyze the root cause 
of this problem.  
There is definitely an improvement in people understanding which modules 
contain which data.  We believe that a hand-out we developed really helped 
this and will continue to continue to emphasize this learning.

Comments received:
Very good and useful
Could have used this sooner
Sessions are not long enough
I love the workshop idea, its so much better than training classes

Two files are attached. The first file includes a project scope and cost 
estimate for 2001. The second file contains two photos of the SVE system that 
was recently started-up. 

The cost estimate is $130,000. This figure includes only contract 
installation dollars, so the work order amount would be about 20-30% more 
than this. The bulk of this figure ($75,000) is for installation of 14

Please don't send flowers, but cards and messages for Graeme will be welcome.  They should be sent to the address below or c/o Julie Webster at Enron's Stockton office who will ensure they are promptly delivered.

Graeme was visited last night by Jeff Skilling and Brian Stanley and they also met members of his family.  Other colleagues planning a visit should contact Julie Webster (+44 1642 623004) or Graham Moore (+44 1642 442133) who are coordinating the program.

Subject:   New Dialing Instructions
 
Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed.
 
What This Change Means To You
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area.
 
To re-program an Auto-Dial button:
 
?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys
?         Press the Program button on your soft keys
?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program
?         Dial the new Dial String (as identified below)

133,"Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature 
Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She 
was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts 
to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may 
have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed 
route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did  
offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area 
which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.  

The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological 
regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and 
animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The 
TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be 
used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed 
prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of 
Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of 
ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species 
which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be 
impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction 
across Arizona.  

I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition 
to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the 
environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the 
pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and 
unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle 
on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this 
piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful 
the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known.",Jean Calhoun Transwestern,,"the Arizona Chapter of The Nature

(1) We rescinded approximately 8 offers in November. It was decided that individuals who gave up jobs to accept our offer would be paid out one month of salary (with a signed release). I had two people who fell into this category and signed releases but have not received the one month salary. Will they be paid out?

(2) I have received several calls from terminated employees concerning the termination letters.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

Court Holds Employer Owes At-Will Employee Duty of Care in Conducting Investigation

In Texas Farm Bureau Insurance Companies v. Sears, the Waco Court of Appeals held that an employer had a duty to its at-will employee to use reasonable care in conducting an investigation into his alleged misconduct.  This case adds additional cause for concern among Texas employers dealing with allegations of employee misconduct and, in conjunction with other recent cases regarding such investigations, indicates a further erosion of the at-will employment doctrine.  The dissenting judge recognized the significant impact that this holding will have on that doctrine, titling his dissent ""At-Will Employment is Dead.""

INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.",,,Enron Corp. Savings Plan Savings Plan Hewitt and Northern Trust Enron

The following information and tips are provided to assist you as you're working with Outlook:

The Outlook mail file size restriction has been removed.  However, if you have ever submitted an eRequest for additional space, you will need to forward an email to the ETS Solution Center to have the email restriction lifted.

The steps listed below will allow you to turn off the Auto-Delete feature, so that your mail will not be deleted as you exit:
		Go to your inbox,
		Select tools,
		Select options,
		Select the ""other"" tab,
		Deselect the check box that says ""empty deleted items folder upon exit"".

You might want to consider creating a folder called 'Junk' or 'Undecided' for any non-business-related information or any retained items you don't want to clutter your normal folder structure.  

Regarding quarantined email messages:
Inbound - For inbound quarantined messages, a ticket needs to be opened with the Resolution Center, 713-853-1411.
If the intended email is of valid business-related content and you believe it requires Enron resources to retrieve it, the Help Desk will open a ticket to have the email released from quarantine and delivered to your e-mail Inbox. Your message will be scanned and checked for viruses prior to requested release.  If it contains a virus or there is reason to suspect it is malicious code, it will not be delivered.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

***********************************************************************

NATURAL GAS PRICES REBOUND AS HEATING SEASON APPROACHES

Despite high storage levels, with heating season coming, the Henry Hub cash 
market has bounced back from early October lows to levels near $2.40 per MMBtu. 
However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased 
US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA 
expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.

*  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are 
increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year. 

*  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential 
and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a 
weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the 
industrial sector.

*  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward 
pressure off of regional differentials. The Northeast examines security issues 
around LNG shipments.

Clipped from the John Mullin article:

The Bears are preparing to play one of the NFL's poorest defenses against
the run but may face that defense without their No. 1 running back.

Rookie tailback Anthony Thomas is questionable with a strained hamstring
that has bothered him for the last couple of weeks, got a little worse in
the win over Tampa Bay and could eventually cause coaches to hold him out of
a game to let it heal.

Thomas did not practice Wednesday and his status for Sunday night's game at
Minnesota will not be determined until closer to game time.

""I can't say when I really did it,"" Thomas said. ""It just bothered me a
little more at the end and halftime when you rest on it awhile.""

Injuries are part of every week's preparations and players become accustomed
to playing with pain and injury. But with a playoff berth possible, the
Bears may bench Thomas to let the hamstring get closer to full strength.

""We could get there,"" said coach Dick Jauron. ""You definitely don't want to
do that, but any player that's out there that has an injury that causes them
to not only be not as effective as they can be but also risks further
injury, you don't want to expose him to that. We'll just have to monitor
that really closely.""


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


Just passing along.   Realize the Bears are thinking now much further past
just this game.   Dick Jauron knows Anthony Thomas will be a big part of
their playoff success and he may be thinking conservatively here.

Enron Unit Must Honor Pact With California Schools (Update1)

     (Adds comment from judge, details of hearing starting in
third paragraph.)

     San Francisco, April 11 (Bloomberg) -- An Enron Corp. unit
must provide electricity to California universities under an
existing contract, U.S. District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton
ordered.
     Enron Energy Services Inc. had agreed to provide energy and
related services to the University of California and California
State University, said Douglas R. Young, a lawyer for the
universities. The company cut off the schools on Feb. 1, and
transferred the accounts to PG&E Corp. and Edison International
utilities, Young said at a hearing today in San Francisco.
     The schools say they want to keep the contract with Enron,
because it is more reliable than the utilities. Both utilities are
burdened with billions in power-buying debt, and Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. has filed for bankruptcy. The utilities' customers
have been subjected to rolling blackouts amid power shortages in
the state.
     ``Enron did not have the right to return the university
systems to the utilities,'' Hamilton said. She granted the
universities' preliminary injunction, forcing Enron to honor the
contract for now.
     Enron and the universities announced the four-year contract
in 1998, valuing the agreement at $300 million to $500 million in
electricity sales. Cal State would save $1.5 million a year
through the contract, they said, and U.C. would save $2.4 million.

                         The Switch

     Enron lawyer A. William Urquhart said the company didn't
cancel the contract; it just switched the source of supply to the
utilities. Enron said it will file an immediate appeal with the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal in San Francisco.
     During the hearing, Urquhart said Enron had a
``responsibility to its shareholders'' to make financially prudent
decisions. At most, the universities have suffered some economic
damage, which would not entitle them to enforce the contract,
Urquhart said.
      California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who filed a
``friend of the court'' brief in the case, said that Enron's duty
to its shareholders ``seems to be to rip off California
consumers.''
     Enron is saying ``we don't want to sell power at the prices
we promised,'' Lockyer said.
     ``We continue to believe that we're acting in the best
interests of our clients,' Enron Energy Services spokeswoman Peggy
Mahoney said after the hearing.

                         Lawsuit

     The universities sued Enron in March, seeking to enforce the
four-year contract. The schools also said in court documents that
buying from utilities would render obsolete new electricity meters
that help them conserve.
     The universities have installed meters to collect data on
consumption, helping them reduce power bills. Those $1,500 meters
can't be used on the ``bundled'' systems like the utilities' and
would have to be removed, said Charles McFadden, spokesman for the
University of California.
     Enron says that it has offered to continue to provide all
campuses with the metering, billing and related services under the
agreement.
     Judge Hamilton ordered the universities to post a $1 million
bond. The routine order assures Enron's losses will be paid, if
the energy company prevails in the case.


Judge orders Enron to deliver electricity to universities
By DAVID KRAVETS
Associated Press Writer

04/11/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Saying that Enron Energy Systems Inc. may be in breach 
of contract, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Houston company to abide 
by its agreement to sell cheap power to the state's public universities. 
Enron was attempting to get out of delivering power for the final year of a 
four-year deal with the California State University and University of 
California systems. Enron, which buys power from producers and sells it on 
the market, said the contract would cost the energy concern $12 million a 
month because of skyrocketing wholesale power prices.
Enron said the state should free Enron from its obligation and taxpayers 
should pick up the tab. 
""It's our economic interest to provide a service with the least amount of 
dollars we can provide it for,"" Enron attorney A. William Urquhart said. He 
later described the case as being ""all about money. It's all about money."" 
Enron said it would file an emergency appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco to overturn U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton's 
ruling in the suit brought by the state's two university systems. 
Appearing in federal court, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer argued that 
Enron wants out of the contract so it can engage in a ""marketing game"" with 
the universities' promised power and sell it on the open market for 10 times 
more than what the electricity cost Enron. 
He said lawmakers may have ""left the keys in the car"" when they approved 
California's failed energy deregulation scheme that has prompted the energy 
crisis, ""But it is still theft to steal the car."" 
The judge issued a temporary injunction against Enron, forcing it to continue 
providing service as the suit brought by the universities proceeds. When the 
judge issued the order, she also said there is a likelihood Enron will lose 
the suit. 
""I am persuaded, in the end, there is a very strong likelihood of success on 
the breach of contract claim,"" the judge said. 
UC's annual electric bill is about $87 million and its natural gas bill is 
about $26 million. CSU annually pays about $40 million for electricity and 
$20 million for natural gas. 
The case is UC Regents vs. Enron Energy Systems Inc., 01-1006.

WSJ.COM: Rumors? Firms Ponder How To Announce Layoffs
By Stephanie Miles

04/11/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WSJ.com 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- When British technology publisher Future Network PLC 
announced a broad restructuring that would result in 350 layoffs, few 
employees were surprised. For a week, workers had been glued to an 
industry-gossip site.
""Everybody was waiting, expecting to be fired,"" says Scott Laine, who was 
laid off from a job in sales for Revolution magazine, published by Future's 
U.S. subsidiary Imagine Media. 
Managers were watching the message boards, too. So, when Future announced the 
restructuring in February, it sent a short companywide e-mail with the press 
release attached. The company also sent out two more detailed letters, from 
Future's chairman and chief executive respectively, explaining in more detail 
the circumstances surrounding the layoffs. But instead of beaming them 
electronically, the U.S. unit printed out color paper copies and placed them 
on employees' desks, in an effort to keep the note from being quickly posted 
online or cleanly photocopied. 
""Why make it easy?"" says Nancy O'Neill, then president of Imagine Media. 
O'Neill stepped down as president at the end of March. 
Leaks are nothing new. But the ""post once, read anywhere"" nature of Internet 
rumors has forced companies to make much quicker decisions about when to 
release information about layoffs to employees and the public, and what 
exactly to say. Companies, for a variety of reasons, are often stuck saying 
""no comment,"" only to confirm the layoff rumors later on. Worse, a scramble 
to respond to investor and press inquiries can sometimes result in 
embarrassing reversals. Wake-Up Calls 

The Web-consulting industry is among the most closely scrutinized sectors on 
Web rumor boards, and companies are under constant pressure to respond. It's 
no accident: Consulting firms have been going through wrenching downsizings 
due to a slowdown in demand for Internet projects. 
After rumors popped up online last month, consulting firm Razorfish Inc. 
(RAZF) confirmed to several press organizations that it was offering a 
""voluntary termination plan"" to an undisclosed number of employees. But a 
little more than a week after the reports of the voluntary plan, postings on 
Vault.com message boards were abuzz with reports of early morning wake-up 
calls. ""Woke me from a sound sleep,"" wrote one anonymous poster at noon 
Saturday. ""Anybody else get jousted (sic) out of bed?"" Other cryptic notes 
followed, and a note on Sunday spelled it out: ""They didn't get as many 
people to volunteer as they wanted to, so from now on it's involuntary."" 
Melissa Kramer, a Razorfish spokeswoman, confirmed that the company called an 
undisclosed number of employees at home Saturday to tell them they no longer 
had jobs, and sent them packages confirming their involuntary termination. 
She says the voluntary plan hadn't drawn as many people as hoped. 
Kramer says the activity on the message boards had no effect on how layoffs 
were carried out, either in terms of how affected employees were notified or 
the timing of the announcement. 
In general, companies have a lot of latitude in deciding what information to 
release. Aside from releasing quarterly earnings reports, public companies 
are required to disclose news that is material to their operations. But when 
it comes to layoffs, the requirements laid out by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission are fuzzy. 
""It's a fact-specific situation,"" says John Heine, an SEC spokesman, 
explaining that the SEC expects companies to report any material changes in 
the company's outlook in its quarterly and annual reports. Severance pay and 
other layoff-related expenses will show up in quarterly reports as 
restructuring charges, but ""there isn't a specific [SEC] rule that I can 
point you to that deals with layoffs,"" Heine says. Business Decision 

Unless the job cuts are so large that local or federal authorities are 
required to be notified under plant-closure or other laws, publicly held 
companies are generally under no obligation to confirm the number of layoffs, 
specific firings, or other work-force changes, experts say. 
Disclosing job cuts is often ""less of a legal determination than it is a 
business decision,"" says Richard Rowe, a corporate attorney and partner with 
Proskauer & Rose LLC in Washington D.C. 
Another issue is timing. Some companies issue a press release announcing cuts 
right away, others wait to release the news with their quarterly earnings 
reports, while others refuse to even comment. (Dow Jones & Co., publisher of 
The Wall Street Journal, recently said that it is laying off an undisclosed 
number of employees at WSJ.com. The company said it will provide more details 
in its quarterly report slated for this week.) 
The decision depends often on how the company thinks layoffs will play with 
investors and surviving employees. For Old Economy industrial firms, cuts are 
often seen as effective way to slash overhead costs. But in the beleaguered 
Internet sector, layoffs often are viewed as a harbinger of future troubles. 
For example, defunct e-tailers eToys Inc. and Garden.com Inc., which traded 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market, both disclosed broad layoffs about three months 
before the companies shut down altogether. 
If the jobs cuts ""are enhancing shareholder value, that's really good news 
for a publicly traded company,"" says John Kroen, executive vice president at 
investor-relations firm Dresner Corporate Services. ""As long as it doesn't 
signal the end."" 
Adding to the pressure on companies facing layoffs are new rules about 
disclosure. While the Internet has loosened companies' control of 
information, the new Regulation FD, which prohibits selective disclosure of 
information, largely limits companies' dissemination options. News can't be 
filtered through analysts or large investors as in the past, so for the most 
part, companies have to either make a public statement or stay mum. 
Take Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). In January, rumor site DotComScoop.com predicted 
that the e-tailer was about to announce widespread layoffs, but Amazon 
declined to comment publicly, citing a policy of not commenting on 
speculation or rumors. Days later, in its fourth-quarter earnings report, the 
company announced that it was firing 1,300 workers and closing a distribution 
facility. 
Amazon didn't return calls seeking comment. 
When EMC Corp. (EMC) fired several hundred workers in February as part of an 
annual review, word leaked out on investor message boards run by Yahoo! Inc. 
(YHOO). Although the storage maker maintains that the job cuts were a routine 
course of business, the company's shares fell as rumors hit the Internet. In 
years past, EMC didn't publicly disclose what it termed performance-based 
firings, according to Mark Fredrickson, vice president of corporate 
communications. This time, however, the company decided to confirm the 
firings in the press in order to make clear that the job cuts weren't related 
to the state of the economy or the technology sector. 
""I think it attracted attention because of the environment,"" he says, adding 
that the company didn't consider the cuts, of roughly 3% of EMC's 24,000 
employees, of material importance to investors. ""Two years ago, in the midst 
of the high growth which we were enjoying, this would not be news."" 
But sometimes, being proactive in the face of rumors can help change the tone 
of coverage. ""It's better to put your words out there yourself then have them 
cut and pasted back at you,"" says Elliot Sloane, president of Sloane PR 
(www.sloanepr.com), a public- and investor-relations firm. 
Last month, for instance, energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) publicly denied 
rumors that it was planning layoffs in its broadband Internet unit, rumors 
that had helped to send its stock to a 52-week low. The company had recently 
terminated a video-on-demand partnership with Blockbuster Inc. (BBI). 
But in a conference call that reiterated the company's 2001 earnings outlook, 
the company explained that third-party contracts for broadband capacity had 
eliminated some of the need to build its own network. An undisclosed number 
of employees had been redeployed as a result, the company said, but the 
rumors of layoffs were false. The stock rallied, reaching $59.40 at 4 p.m. 
that Friday, up from a low of $51.51 Thursday morning. Circling the Wagons 

Still, many executives resist issuing any comment on layoffs or work-force 
shifts. ""The majority of the CEOs I've dealt with want to keep it as much 
in-house as possible,"" says Dresner 's Kroen. ""It's rare that you find a CEO 
who wants to tell as much as possible. They have to be pushed to air their 
dirty laundry."" 
While top executives huddle to put the final touches on layoff plans and 
discuss how much information to release publicly, employees can face days or 
weeks of waiting for the ax to fall. Message boards can get very crowded. 
At Imagine, O'Neill says, ""I wish we could have done something different [to 
avoid] a period of anxiety where people were searching for anything that's a 
scrap of news."" But British financial disclosure rules governing parent 
Future Networks dictated the timing of the announcement, she says. As a 
result, the official news came out nearly a week after rumors first surfaced 
on the Web. 
In the meantime, so many co-workers were piling onto F____edCompany.com that 
one participant piped in: ""Hi, since everyone here seems to be from Imagine, 
I lost my bathroom key and entry card yesterday. If anyone finds it, could 
they please post here?""

Here's my my comments to Mark's answers to the questions, and suggestions to 
Jimmie's model.  I don't answer the bottom line question, since we have some 
talking to do on the model.  

Jimmie, your model is great except we have to value the company on cash flow 
(as opposed to NI).  I've take a stab at setting up the discounted cash flow 
model.  All my stuff is highlighted in yellow.  

It's the capex that's screwy (see assumptions given in questions).  I get at 
25% of 1995 revs, not 45.8% as indicated in the assumptions.  

I also assume that when it sez working capital is net zero, we don't factor 
those balance sheet line items into the DCF model.  Others agree?  

Anyway, it gives me a $3.32 share value, so I think the model's got some 
work.  Take a look and let me know what you think.

of my holding period, but I will do it anyway and just
not sell. They want better performance and they want it

I'm informed that Mr. Lay is currently out of the country and that your

In the meantime, I am attaching a document that Ken Lay distributed to 
business leaders at meetings in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles about 2 weeks 
ago.  It is the document referenced in the Dow Jones wire story and does 
include the Company's view that a core/noncore market structure is the right 
answer for California (though the document has not been shared with Speaker 
Hertzberg).  

Mr. Lay discussed the core/noncore proposal extensively during his trip to 
Sacramento several weeks ago when, as you recall, he visited Sacramento and 
met with a variety of legislators from both sides of the aisle to discuss 
solutions to California's electricity crisis.

But unlike the Speaker's core/noncore proposal that I read about in today's 
San Francisco Chronicle, Enron's the proposal does not shift all of Edison's 
past due amounts from small consumers to California businesses. The Company 
believes that all customers should be responsible for the costs that have 
been incurred on their behalf.

I will be in Sacramento on Monday, June 4th and would like to discuss our 
proposal with you further if you would find it useful and if your schedule 
permits.  I'm also available to discuss the proposal further by phone if you 
would like to talk before Monday.

239,"I'm throwing out my thoughts on question 1 for the current case.

1.  Evaluate Patten's business strategy.

    My first thought centered around the fact that Patten's real expertise is
in real estate development.  They have a well thought out strategy of who the
customer is and how to sell effectively to these customers.  They have
developed a good business relationship with the large property owners.  With
little risk they analyze their ability to subdivide the properties.  Once
this is completed and the land purchased, they unleash their marketing
strategy.
    The marketing strategy seems to effectively gain sales without
extravegant costs.  The sales staff is custom designed to relate personally
to the average customer.  Their gross margin for land sales is 54.8%.  Even
if you include the selling, general and admin expense their margin is 24%.
    The part of their business strategy I struggle with is the finance
business.  What do a bunch of land developers know about finance.  In my
opinion land financing should be left to the experts.  If they established a
preferred financing company, they could negotiate a standard finders fee for
the loans.  More importantly they would eliminate the risk in their revenue
streams.  When they make a sale the revenue could be immediately booked since
they would not hold the debt, the finance company would.  Their current
portfolio of notes receivable is $18.6M.  It looks like ignoring expenses
their financing margin is 3%.  This only gives $0.56M in revenues.  This
number seems pretty small compared to the accounting heartburn it creates.
Obviously this number would be much smaller if they were properly estimating
unrecoverables.
    I guess the bottom line is ""what is their core competency""?  I believe
its land development not land finance.

Anyway give me your thoughts and I'll clean it up in a word document.

Carnival Cruises goes too but this cruise sounded more suited to mom and dad.

If we do the July cruise and land package, it is $4998 (air fare, cruise,
port costs) for mom and dad which comes to $1300 for each one of us.

I leave Saturday for a week so I'd appreciate some feedback before I go if
possible (not necessarily a commitment, just feedback).  I think they have
this hold for a few days though I don't necessarily think we have to decide
immediately.  If we want to do this, there is a $300/person deposit (didn't
ask if it is refundable or not), with the balance due 75 days before

242,"CA-ISO REPORT BLAMES CALIFORNIA'S JUNE PRICE SPIKES ON THE LACK OF HEDGING, 
SUGGESTS THAT LOWERED PRICE CAPS HAVE DONE LITTLE TO STOP UNRELENTING, HIGH 
WHOLESALE POWER PRICES
  
09/20/2000 
Foster Electric Report 
Page 3 
(c) Copyright 2000, Foster Associates, Inc. 
The California Independent System Operator, Inc.'s (CA-ISO's) market 
surveillance committee (MSC) has found that utility reluctance to use hedging 
tools and a market design that continues to be faulty despite the 
implementation of reforms were the main reasons for the sustained price 
increases that hit California's wholesale markets in June 2000. 
According to an MSC report -- An Analysis of the June 2000 Price Spikes in 
the California ISO's Energy and Ancillary Services Markets -- the exercise of 
market power in California's wholesale power markets remains rampant. In 
fact, the MSC insisted that market rule changes implemented since last summer 
""have enhanced the ability of market participants to exercise market power in 
the California electricity market."" And while the CA-ISO lowered its 
wholesale buyers' price cap from $750 to $250 following California's June 
price spikes, the MSC said the lowered cap has had little impact. Monthly 
average energy prices during June 2000 when the price cap was $750/MWh were 
lower than those during August 2000 when the price cap was $250/MWh although 
roughly the same amount of energy was consumed during these two months, the 
MSC reported. 
The MSC was also critical of existing regulatory constraints on forward 
contracting for energy and ancillary services by California's three utility 
distribution companies (UDCs) --Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California 
Edison Co., and San Diego Gas & Electric --and the failure of the UDCs to use 
the limited rights they had in this regard. ""The June 2000 price spikes can 
be attributed to several factors,"" the report stated. The primary cause, 
however, ""was the lack of sufficient forward energy and ancillary services 
purchases for the month of June 2000 by the UDCs."" The failure to enter these 
contracts then enhanced the ability of generators in and outside the ISO 
control area to exercise market power during high-demand conditions. 
""Had California's three utility distribution companies (UDCs) signed forward 
financial contracts equal to their expected net demand for energy and 
ancillary services during each hour of the months of May and June 2000, 
average prices in the PX and ISO markets during these months would have been 
significantly lower,"" the report stated. ""Even if the June 2000 price spikes 
had still occurred, the UDCs would have been largely insulated from this spot 
market price volatility, because of their forward hedges."" 
Still, the MSC noted that the UDCs are not solely at fault, having been 
severely limited by the California Public Utilities Commission. Before last 
month, the UDCs could only make limited forward purchases in the CA-PX's 
block forward market, for only certain times of the day and little 
flexibility. ""The CPUC restrictions on forward contracting through the CA-PX 
were especially pernicious because the PX was granted a monopoly over forward 
trading by the UDCs,"" the report declared. And while the CPUC on August 3 
gave SoCal Edison and PG&E more authority to enter long-term bilateral 
contracts, the MSC criticized the move because trading levels are still 
restricted. Similarly, SDG&E has little incentive to enter forward contracts 
because it can pass through its purchased power costs to its customers, no 
matter how high the price. 
Besides forward contracts, the report said other causes of the June price 
spikes were the inability of consumers to adjust their demand in response to 
high prices, and the CA-ISO's new method for allocating replacement reserve 
costs. All the above factors allowed generators to exercise more market power 
in May 2000 than any of the summer months of 1999, the report said, and this 
market manipulation increased even further in June 2000. 
The MSC then took special aim at market rule changes recently adopted (such 
as a new replacement reserve policy ) or under consideration to enhance 
system reliability that can increase the market power exercised in 
California's energy and ancillary services markets. ""The CA-ISO operators 
must recognize that they are running markets for energy and ancillary 
services,"" the report explained. ""For that reason, they must carefully 
consider the incentives for market participant behavior created by any market 
rule changes designed to enhance system reliability. Failing to do so can 
result in unnecessarily high prices in the energy and ancillary services 
markets and can exacerbate system reliability problems."" 
So what's the solution? While the construction of new generation and 
transmission facilities in California would naturally increase the 
competitiveness of the CA-ISO's energy and ancillary services markets, the 
MSC believes fundamental market reforms are also needed. ""The California 
electricity market is not so structurally competitive that market outcomes 
are invariant to market rules,"" it stated. ""The industry is composed of a 
relatively small number of firms, some of which own a sizable fraction of the 
total electricity generating capacity located in the CA-ISO control area. The 
geographic distribution of generation unit ownership can allow some owners to 
exercise locational market power during certain system conditions. In 
addition, the amount of generating capacity owned by some market participants 
allows them to exercise market power during high-load conditions, when there 
is not a physical scarcity of available generating capacity to serve this 
load. Furthermore . . . demand for wholesale electricity in California is 
extremely insensitive to price. Consequently, the structure of the California 
electricity market, at least for the near term, is one where market outcomes 
are very sensitive to market rules."" 
As a short-term solution, the MSC support the retail rate freeze (see related 
story, this REPORT) recently signed into law for SDG&E's customers. However, 
it also suggested that the CPUC allow SDG&E broad freedom to engage in 
forward contracting, and that the retail rate ceiling be coupled with a 
requirement that SDG&E ""offer rate schedules that encourage retail customers 
to alter their demand in response to hourly wholesale electricity prices."" 
Of two possible long-term solutions, the MSC dismissed the reimposition of 
cost-of-service regulation for all but the larger industrial, commercial and 
governmental customers. ""This scheme would simply continue the proposed 
short-term solution indefinitely,"" the report reasoned. Further, the option 
may prove unworkable now that the UDCs own little of their own generation. 
The MSC said, ""This solution would continue to leave unanswered the 
fundamental question of cost-of-service regulation: What is the regulated 
firm's minimum-cost mode of production and how should output prices be set to 
provide the strongest possible incentives for the firm to produce in this 
manner? . . . Under this market structure, the CPUC would have to determine 
the prudency of the energy purchasing decisions made by UDCs across the many 
energy and capacity markets and purchasing time horizons available. A 
perceived inability of regulatory processes around the world to cause firms 
to produce in a least-cost manner in the former vertically integrated 
monopoly regime led to the widespread introduction of competition in 
generation and supply. It is difficult to see how regulating the UDCs' retail 
rates under the current regime will be less complex than regulating them 
under the former vertically integrated monopoly regime when the UDCs owned 
significantly more generation and also operated the bulk transmission grid in 
their service territories."" 
A second approach that the MSC supports and first outlined last year is to 
separate the distribution side of the UDC's business from the retail supply 
side. Under this arrangement, the price for delivering power anywhere in the 
UDC's service territory would be set by the CPUC. The supply side of the 
UDC's business would be unregulated, except the requirement that it offer a 
fixed default retail rate for each customer class. The report noted that the 
MSC's plan is not new, having been recently put in place in the England and 
Wales electricity market. The major advantage ""is that it does not require 
the CPUC to make a determination of the prudency of the wholesale energy 
purchasing decisions of the UDC,"" the report continued. Further, the supply 
side of the UDC's business can forward contract or purchase on any of the 
CA-PX and CA-ISO markets in any manner they find profitable. 
Finally, among other things, the MSC recommended (1) replacement of the 
current CA-ISO replacement reserve policy with a real-time trading charge, a 
penalty for the oversupply of real-time energy, and the cost of out-of-market 
calls being assigned to the over-consumption of real-time energy; (2) a 
greater emphasis on the market-power implications of proposed market rule 
changes, including reconsideration of the current out-of-market payment 
mechanism, the CA-ISO's 10-minute settlement market, and PG&E hydro 
divestiture agreement with the CA-ISO; and (3) expedited siting and 
construction of new or expanded transmission and generation capacity in

247,"NRG AFFILIATES ASK FERC TO RULE ON DISPUTED STATION POWER ISSUES AFFECTING 
DIVESTED GENERATION ASSETS
  
10/04/2000 
Foster Electric Report 
Page 13 
(c) Copyright 2000, Foster Associates, Inc. 
In a renewal of a controversy that has arisen several times in the past with 
respect to the issue of station power, three NRG affiliates that purchased 
electric generation facilities from Niagara Mohawk Corp. in 1999 -- Dunkirk 
Power LLC, Huntley Power LLC and Oswego Harbor LLC (EL00-113) -- petitioned 
FERC on 9/22/00 to declare that NRG's electric generation facilities have the 
right (and have had this right since their purchase from Niagara Mohawk) to 
treat station power as net/negative generation. The petitioners also asked 
FERC to confirm they have the option of obtaining station power from the grid 
at wholesale, regardless of whether the generation facility is running at 
that specific time, together with the ability to net the station power from 
the facility's sales to the wholesale energy market. Further, the petition 
wants the Commission to declare that Niagara Mohawk cannot require any of 
NRG's generation facilities to obtain station power under a retail tariff, or 
resort to state law self-help procedures to bypass the Commission's 
jurisdiction, disconnect or terminate station power, thereby shutting down 
the facilities. Finally, pending resolution of the instant petition, the NRG 
entities urged FERC to issue an interim order preventing Niagara Mohawk from 
disconnecting or terminating station power for any NRG generation facility. 
If station power service were terminated, the petition noted, the three NRG 
entities would be unable to supply their total capacity of 3,060 MW to the 
New York ISO control area. 
The petition was prompted by Niagara Mohawk's commencement of billing in late 
1999 and early 2000 for station power under its retail tariff for the three 
NRG facilities, NRG questioned the bills since divested generation assets are 
not subject to retail tariff rates under Commission precedent. While Niagara 
Mohawk admitted that its retained generation facilities are still allowed to 
treat station power as negative generation to be netted against output, it 
responded to NRG's questions by sending disconnection notices to the NRG 
facilities. 
Historically, the NRG petition stressed, vertically integrated facilities 
(including Niagara Mohawk) have treated -- and still treat -- station power 
as net/negative generation. Franchise utilities have not charged themselves 
for station power service under their retail tariffs nor have they used such 
tariffs to charge other utilities with generation facilities in their retail 
service territory. ""Even today, these same utilities continue to treat 
station power as net/negative generation for their own and other favored 
generation facilities,"" said the filing. ""At the same time, these utilities 
are trying to unilaterally impose retail tariffs and rates on station power 
service for their divested generation. But these divested generation assets 
are the exact same facilities for which the utilities have historically 
treated station power as net/negative generation."" 
As evidenced by the historical practice of netting station power, the NRG 
entities first cited a 1972 start-up agreement between Central Hudson, 
Consolidated Edison of New York and Niagara Mohawk (joint owners of the 
Roseton generating facility in Central Hudson's exclusive retail service 
area) providing that start-up power (a component of station power) obtained 
from Central Hudson should be netted against output before net generation was 
allocated among them. Second, the New York Power Pool Agreement (approved by 
FERC in 1991) similarly allowed the netting of station power for members with 
generation facilities in the exclusive retail service territories of other 
members. Third, transition energy sales agreements between Con Edison and NRG 
(concerning NRG's recent purchase of two divested generation facilities from 
Con Edison) explicitly authorized the treatment of station power as 
net/negative generation. These assignments were accepted by the Commission as 
part of the process to obtain approval for the divestiture of jurisdictional 
assets. In the PJM market, the petition noted (1) a recent filing by PJM 
Interconnection L.L.C. (ER00-3513) revising its open-access transmission 
tariff (OATT) and Operating Agreement to make clear that the historical 
practice of netting station power service against gross generation should 
continue even after the utilities divested most of their generation; and (2) 
recent interconnection agreements filed by Conectiv, in conjunction with a 
request seeking FERC approval to divest jurisdictional assets to affiliates 
of NRG, expressly treating station power as negative generation. Finally, the 
NRG petition observed, the Commission has approved market rules of the New 
England ISO recognizing that market participants have the option of netting 
station power. 
Thus, the NRG entities concluded, the Commission-approved arrangements and 
historical practices in New York, PJM and New England all show that station 
power has been and continues to be treated as net/negative generation. ""These 
arrangements also demonstrate that utilities such as Niagara Mohawk and Con 
Edison -- the same utilities that are now trying to impose retail tariffs on 
their divested generation --benefitted from prior netting arrangements right 
up until the time these assets were divested. These same utilities are 
currently allowing their own retained and other favored generation to net at 
the same time they are trying to force the divested generation to pay for 
such station power under retail tariffs."" Moreover, the petition added, the 
historical practice of netting is consistent with the Commission's repeated 
statement that ""load is not served at a generating unit"" through transmission 
or interconnection assets. 
The petition requested that FERC confirm its prior rulings and declare that 
NRG's generation facilities have the right and option to treat station power 
as negative generation to be netted against gross generation. This 
declaration would recognize that the historical practice of netting station 
power is still the most efficient means of ensuring that all generators have 
equal access to essential station power in a market-based system. In other 
words, ""nothing in a competitive market suddenly transforms station power 
into a retail event."" 
By declaring that station power as negative generation is a scheduled service 
available under the Commission's pro forma tariff, the petition contended, 
the Commission will further the public's interest in a competitive energy 
market and, simultaneously, ""preempt the type of discriminatory and 
anti-competitive conduct that necessitated this petition in the first place,"" 
namely, efforts by utilities such as Niagara Mohawk to impose retail tariff 
rates on station power service to divested assets while still allowing their 
own retained generation facilities (and other favored facilities) to net 
station power. Including station power service in pro forma tariffs would not 
only provide generators with a service necessary to operation of their 
interconnected facility but would also ensure availability of the service to 
all generators on fair and nondiscriminatory terms, the petition added. 
Furthermore, the NRG entities said the Commission has and should exercise 
jurisdiction over station power issues. Since generating facilities cannot be 
operated without station power, the petition explained, the provision of 
station power ""affects or relates to"" the generator's ability to produce and 
sell electric power in wholesale markets. Thus, the provision of station 
power is ""an integral and essential part"" of the interconnection and 
operation of that generator. ""The Commission's jurisdiction therefore easily 
extends to the provision of station power and supports the issuance of a 
declaratory order ensuring that station power is made available to all 
generators on efficient, nondiscriminatory terms as part of a pro forma 
tariff."" 
Based on the above discussion, the petition requested FERC to issue an order 
declaring that Niagara Mohawk cannot impose its unbundled retail tariff on 
NRG's generation facilities. However, the petition made clear, the requested 
declaration -- like the OATT revisions proposed recently by PJM -- would not 
prohibit any generator form voluntarily agreeing to take station power under 
a retail tariff. ""It is the option to take station power as a scheduled 
service under the pro form tariff that is important. By mandating this 
choice, the Commission will ensure that utilities cannot take advantage of a 
generator's need for station power."" 
The Commission should further declare, given its exclusive jurisdiction over 
the wholesale energy market, that Niagara Mohawk cannot use state law 
self-help remedies such as disconnection or termination of station power to 
force payment from a wholesale generator. Any attempt to rely on state law 
procedures is clearly preempted by the Commission's exclusive jurisdiction, 
NRG said. Finally, since both NRG and the public will suffer irreparable harm 
if Niagara Mohawk is allowed to terminate station power service and shut down 
the generation facilities in question, the Commission should issue an interim 
order prohibiting Niagara Mohawk from terminating station power service until 
these proceedings have been completed.","Niagara Mohawk Niagara Mohawk's Niagara

the incentive to overcollect such that they can apply the amounts against the

258,"After months of effort, we have succeeded in putting together a Blackout
Notification System that will provide California employers, residents, and
public safety officers with adequate time to respond to an impending rolling
blackout.

As you know, Governor Davis appointed me to the California ISO last
February. Through the leadership of our Energy Committee at the
Manufacturing Group, I introduced a motion at CAISO on March 30. The motion
stated that California needed a better Blackout Notification System than the
passive system previously in place.  After the motion passed 5-0, the ISO
and PG&E held focus groups with employers and residents throughout the state
to ask customers what they need to more adequately prepare for planned
rolling blackouts, and if possible to help prevent them from occurring.

Then, Governor Davis stepped in and directed ISO, the Office of Emergency
Services, and the Energy Oversight Board to work with the utilities to build
a proactive notification system.  This system provides not only a 1-hour
advanced warning before a blackout could occur, but to also includes 48 and
24-hour notices that blackouts might happen due to predicted hot weather
conditions, and/or a lack of energy supply, or planned and unplanned
maintenance at generation facilities.  The proactive approach sought by
Governor Davis and by my motion at CAISO will include a system by which
residents and employers can have their extensive contact information such
e-mails, pagers, and cell phones listed in a database.  All contacts can
receive a 48, 24 and 1-hour automatic notification in advance.

What is particularly exciting about this proactive approach is that we can
better prepare for a blackout with adequate time to power down assembly
lines and computers, and power up emergency generators. We can also prevent
a blackout by taking action within that hour which reduces load and can even
help avoid blackouts.

Again, kudos go to the Manufacturing Group's Energy Committee for pushing
this plan last February to take to the CAISO Board and to Governor Davis. By
expanding this plan, we can make sure an even larger window of notice is
proactively provided to Californians.  The plan will be rolled out publicly
tomorrow (Friday, June 15, 2001) and incrementally implemented as soon as
possible. We will soon provide further updates on how employers throughout
the Valley and state on how they can register in the new database for this
proactive notification system.

265,"As part of its Memorandum of Understanding with DWR, SDG&E has filed the
attached advice letter.  If approved, SDG&E would be authorized to transfer
a $104 million overcollection in its TCBA to its Energy Rate Ceiling Revenue
Shortfall Account (the account established to record the revenue shortfall
from the implementation of AB 265).  The $104 million represents the
overcollection in utility retained generation revenues allocated to
customers which did not come under the AB 265 rate ceiling. That group would
include direct access customers.  SDG&E's rationale for the transfer is that
it is the legislature's intent that 100% of SDG&E's retained generation be
used to serve its 100 kW and below customers (i.e., the AB 265 customers).
SDG&E had advanced this theory in its recent rate design case.  It was
opposed by several groups and has not been ruled on by the Commission.

Also, here's fyi some of the questions that I came up with when going over 
the case...
1. Problem #1 and #2: When calculating incremental cost do we include fixed
costs (i.e. $10,000 for tooling plastic rings) and do we include sunk costs
materials for the steel inventory?  In addition, do we need to break out the
overhead into fixed and variable and include only the variable portion in
the calculation of incremental cost?

2. Problem #3: What are we supposed to be comparing to calculate
differential cost of the 25,450 steel rings?

3. Problem #4: What time period should we include in calculating profit?  Is
it enough to look strictly at present time (per unit costs)? Or should we
look at profit over for example 5 years (from looking at the replacement
rate of plastic rings)?

4. Problem #5: Once we calculate problems #1 - #3, do we assume that
Burggeman is the only plastic ring producer?  And should we look at customer
desire to reduce their costs by buying plastic over steel rings because of
the difference in usable life?

Aide to Davis Gets Rid of Stock Power: Press secretary sells his of 300 shares in Calpine after being criticized for praising the firm. SEC seeks records from other advisors.

Gov. Gray Davis' chief spokesman said Thursday that he has sold his 300 shares of stock in a California power company in the face of criticism that his ownership constituted a conflict of interest. 
Meanwhile, in a sign that its insider-trading investigation may be intensifying, the Securities and Exchange Commission has in recent days asked some of Davis' energy advisors to supply information about their personal stock trades, according to sources. The SEC began an inquiry last week to determine whether Davis consultants traded energy stocks based on privileged information gleaned in their jobs advising the governor.
The developments came amid an uproar over stock holdings by a number of Davis administration officials and contract employees, several of whom purchased large amounts of stock in energy companies just before or during their employment by the state in energy-related jobs. 
Davis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, said that he had not been ordered to sell the Calpine Corp. stock, which he bought in May, but that it had become ""more of a distraction than it was worth."" He had been widely criticized for holding shares in Calpine while publicly praising it as an example of a responsible energy company. Maviglio is not believed to be part of the SEC probe. 
The administration last week fired four state energy traders after finding that they bought electricity from Calpine while owning the company's stock. A fifth trader left to take another job three days after disclosing her stock ownership. And a negotiator of power contracts who owned Calpine stock was fired because he reviewed a state contract to buy power from the San Jose-based company. 
Vikram Budhraja, a key energy consultant to Davis, received a letter from the SEC on Wednesday, a week after California Secretary of State Bill Jones singled out Budhraja's stock transactions in a complaint to the SEC. 
Budhraja's attorney, Stephen Kaufman, said Budhraja received a simple, one-page letter stating that the SEC was conducting an inquiry into possible violations of security fraud laws. 
It is common in the early stages of an investigation for the SEC to send letters asking that individuals voluntarily supply information such as stock-trading records. 
""They asked that we voluntarily provide documents relating to all of my client's stock transactions since Jan. 1,"" Kaufman said. ""We do not believe the SEC matter has any basis whatsoever. And the documentation will show in no uncertain terms that Mr. Budhraja was never involved in insider trading."" 
Jones estimated that Budhraja made a 40% profit in January buying and selling stock of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison. He said Budhraja also made a 28% profit in trading stock of Houston energy company Dynegy Corp. that he bought Jan. 11. 
Kaufman said Budhraja's stock purchases do not constitute insider trading because the transactions occurred before state officials first talked with the consultant about a job Jan. 25, so he could not have decided to buy because of confidential information. 
""Insider trading requires the use of knowledge that was not generally available to the public,"" Kaufman said. He said his client is simply a savvy investor. 
Dispute Over Contract Dates 
Jones, however, said the $6.2-million contract between the Electric Power Group, which Budhraja heads, and the state to manage California's power buying is dated Jan. 18, before he bought his second batch of Edison stock. 
Kaufman maintains that the contract was misdated. 
""Ultimately, the contracts, the invoices, the governor's office and the DWR [Department of Water Resources] will confirm that the first contact was on Jan. 25,"" Kaufman said. ""[Budhraja] came on board on the 29th and he sold his stock that morning."" 
Fired trader William Mead, whose purchase of more than $100,000 in Calpine stock was highlighted in Jones' complaint to the SEC, could not be reached Thursday. But he has said he did nothing wrong. 
Former power trader Elaine Griffin, who resigned three weeks ago and still owns about $10,000 of Calpine stock, said Thursday that she has not been contacted by the SEC but would welcome an inquiry. 
""It doesn't matter to me because I didn't do anything wrong,"" she said. ""The state did something wrong by not having us fill out these [financial] statements five months ago when we started. Now it's a big deal."" 
Davis spokesman Maviglio said he sold his Calpine shares Thursday morning, two days after questions arose about his purchase of that stock and shares of Enron Corp., a Texas-based generator that has been one of Davis' key targets for criticism. 
Maviglio said he had not sold the Enron stock, but had sent a letter to the state Fair Political Practices Commission asking for advice on whether it was proper for him to own it. He previously had defended his ownership of both stocks, saying that he had not been privy to any insider information. 
FPPC spokeswoman Sigrid Bathen said she could not confirm whether the commission had received the letter and could not comment about Maviglio's specific situation. 
In general, state law requires government officials to disclose any potential conflict of interest and to disqualify themselves from acting on any matter in which they hold a financial interest. 
Maviglio said that Davis has not asked him to resign and that he has no intention of doing so. 
He leavened his predicament with humor, joking--after answering the phone in the governor's press office, a job usually done by a subordinate--that he had been reduced to answering phones as a result of a Los Angeles Times editorial calling for his removal. 
He also observed wryly that he had taken a sizable loss on the Calpine stock, which has followed a general retreat by energy stocks in recent weeks. 
""I took a $1,300 bath, thank you very much,"" he said.

Consumed by the power crisis, I've pined for a tour of one of Northern California's energy generators, a setup I heard was an impressive sight. It took a while to arrange - you know these moguls - but it was worth the wait. I came away with nothing but admiration for this noble power supplier. 
No, heat stroke has not addled my judgment. This is no valentine to Mirant or Calpine or Enron. I think we've all got some pointed words for those companies, right?
I'm talking about my visit to John Chapman's Danville home. 
Yes, a retired businessman from Danville has gotten into the power business. Well, sort of. 
Chapman is an ardent environmentalist who, four years ago, installed a photovoltaic net-metering energy system at his 3,800- square-foot house. Forty-eight solar panels face 15 degrees to the south on Chapman's roof, and the energy he receives from it not only powers his home but goes onto the PG&E grid for others to use. 
""When I'm exporting power during the day,"" Chapman says, ""my neighbors are using my electricity. I kid them and tell them I'm going to send them all bills."" 
Unlike conventional solar-energy systems, Chapman's does not send the power it generates into batteries that are used to power his home. Rather, the electricity is funneled through to PG&E's grid, which serves as kind of a storage unit for his needs. 
Any excess power is sent out to those in Chapman's power block, meaning that PG&E can charge his neighbors for power it obtained gratis from Chapman. At night, when Chapman's photovoltaic cells ebb, he takes back electricity from the grid. It works like a savings account at a bank. 
Sure, it's not exactly gobs of electricity that Chapman is exporting to the grid, but that's not the point. 
""The theory is, you create energy during the day and draw it at night,"" he said. ""It's called metering, and it works. The great thing is that it generates the most in peak hours of the day, when the system's under the most pressure."" 
It is an awesome sight to catch a glimpse of Chapman's meter during daylight hours. 
Most of the time, the meter runs backward. 
On the day I visited, the meter was not moving forward or backward. Chapman was using all the energy his system was generating. 
""Oh, that's because I'm heating my pool right now,"" he said, smiling. 
That smile is born of satisfaction and forethought. Chapman is something of a solar-energy pioneer in these parts. In 1997, he became the first homeowner in Contra Costa County to install a solar system that plugs directly into the grid. It wasn't cheap, though. Light Energy Systems in Concord charged him about $25,000 to install the unit. 
Remember, this was long before regulation and the energy crisis. When some of his neighbors learned of the price tag, they thought he was being extravagant. They don't anymore. 
""Yeah, I feel a little smug,"" Chapman says. ""I didn't do it to save money. Back in 1997, when I made the decision, my bills were normal. I'm just a passionate believer in getting off fossil fuels and developing new technology. I know $25,000 is a lot, but it's coming down. Now, the more this technology is installed, the cheaper it gets. So, someone had to start it."" 
It wasn't easy to get PG&E to agree to partner with Chapman is this experiment in clean electricity. He fought long and hard to get the power company to agree to the deal, agreeing to take out insurance in case ""I blew up the grid,"" he recalls with a laugh. 
One year after Chapman's system was up and running, the state Assembly passed AB 1755, a net-metering bill requiring utilities to let residents like Chapman tie their solar power to the grid and get energy ""credit."" PG&E says only 12 customers in its service area have become net-metering generators. 
""My interest in it is as an environmentalist,"" says Chapman, who has been involved with the Sierra Club for many years. ""It's pollution-free and renewable. Theoretically, there's an unlimited supply of sun. I've read there's only a 75-year supply of oil left."" 
Chapman is like a proud poppa showing off his system. Lately, he's become something of a media darling. 
""Even TV stations and newspapers from Japan have come out here to film it,"" he says. ""I'm not out for publicity, just to get the renewable-energy message out."" 
Chapman's home is tucked in a cranny of the foothills west of Interstate 680, and the 48 solar panels are not evident from the street. 
But walk around to the south side of Chapman's house, and there they are. Some are propped up on girders, pointed south. They aren't the prettiest sight, but aesthetics were not Chapman's priority. He did say, however, that new technology allows home builders to install solar roof shingles that look only slightly different from regular roof shingles. 
""After the initial cost, I haven't had to do any repairs,"" Chapman says. ""It's not like a common solar house, where you have to replace the batteries every five years. And then, as an environmentalist, you have to find a way to dispose of the batteries, and that's troubling."" 
At that point in his presentation, Chapman flung open a pair of French doors near his garage to show off his inverter.It's large, but not imposing. He can hide it behind doors, and visitors might mistake it for a storage space. There are no gaudy generators or towers. There's no blight on the landscape. 
""This is the brains of the thing, where AC turns to DC (energy), and these wires here send it right into PG&E's hookup,"" Chapman says. ""If I didn't choose to use my pool heater and my air conditioning - which I do only when it's really hot - I'd be exporting even more power. 
""If you don't have as big a house as this and don't have a pool, you don't need this huge of a system,"" he says. ""I'd like to see a day when everybody has this."" 
Of course, Chapman also would like to see the day when everybody drives electric - or, at least, hybrid - automobiles. He's thinking of buying one himself and, of course, he wants to find a way to recharge it off his personal power supply.

HOW MANY more of Gov. Gray Davis' advisers are holding stock in companies that are making big bucks from California's power crisis? 
Surely it's time for Davis to disclose who else among his team of energy experts is profiting along with the companies he accuses of gouging the public.
A growing list of the governor's energy advisers and appointed regulators have stock holdings in booming power companies with whom they have official dealings. 
Ownership of such lucrative energy stocks by officials seeking solutions to a state power emergency that is draining the treasury not only looks bad, it has the strong odor of a conflict of interest. 
Chronicle reporter Bill Wallace revealed yesterday that Bruce Williston, a Davis appointee to the California Electric Oversight Board, has about $1 million worth of stock in Enron Corp., one of the state's major power suppliers. 
On Wednesday, Chronicle reporter Scott Winokur disclosed that the chairman of the California Energy Commission, William Keese, last year owned about $510,000 in stocks of companies his agency regulates and never recused himself from official actions affecting those firms. 
Last week, Davis felt compelled to fire five consultants for conflicts of interest -- a sixth quit -- after it was discovered they were negotiating contracts from power companies whose stock they owned. 
Then, it was disclosed Davis' top spokesman, Steve Maviglio, in June purchased $12,000 worth of stock in Calpine Corp. of San Jose, another major energy provider. 
It does not take a ethicist to know that the governor's advisers, agents and appointees should avoid stocks in energy companies doing business with the state. 
No state official should be -- or even appear to be -- in a position to profit from a crisis that has hurt so many Californians.

Under fire for owning energy stock, Steve Maviglio, Gov. Gray Davis' chief spokesman, yesterday sold his stock in Calpine Corp. 
The revelation comes as Davis' administration continues to be battered by reports that appointees and consultants working on the energy crisis own stock in power companies.
Maviglio, Davis' interim communications director, sold the 300 shares of Calpine that he had purchased last month, said spokeswoman Hilary McLean. 
""He felt it was becoming a distraction,"" McLean said. 
She said that the sale was voluntarily and that no one had asked Maviglio to sell the stock. 
Republicans and public-interest groups criticized Maviglio for purchasing the stock while the Davis administration was negotiating long-term energy contracts with Calpine and promoting the company's efforts to build power plants in California. 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, who is challenging Davis in 2002, and an editorial in the Los Angeles Times both called on Maviglio to resign. 
But Maviglio won't be fired or reprimanded for the purchase, McLean said. 
Earlier this week, Maviglio said that he had purchased 300 shares of Calpine at $40 each on June 20, after putting in an order on May 31. He denied any conflict of interest and said the stock had been sold earlier this week. 
Shares of Calpine, based in San Jose, closed at $36.80 yesterday. They had dropped 9.2 percent from June 20 to yesterday's close. 
Maviglio also owns stock in Enron, an energy trading company that sells electricity to California. Maviglio bought the stock in February 1996. Those shares were not sold, but he is seeking further clarification on any possible conflict, McLean said. 
Republicans and public interest groups have criticized Davis after disclosures that some advisers and consultants to the state on energy matters owned shares in companies that are trading electricity or negotiating long-term power contracts with California. 
Last week, Davis fired five energy advisers for possible conflict- of-interest problems after they helped negotiate state spot-market purchases or long-term power contracts. Four of the five owned stock in Calpine, and the fifth held Enron shares.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Gov. Gray Davis' press secretary sold the 300 stocks he held in an energy company Thursday, after being criticized for owning the stock while he publicly touted the company's responsibility. 
Steve Maviglio said he had not been told to sell the stock in San Jose-based power generator Calpine Corp., but did so because it had become ""more of a distraction than it was worth."" Critics called his ownership a conflict of interest.
Maviglio has praised Calpine as an example of a responsible energy company. 
Calpine has received about $13 billion in state contracts to supply electricity for up to 20 years. 
Maviglio said he has not sold stock he owns in the Texas-based power generator Enron Corp., but has sent a letter to the Fair Political Practices Commission asking if it is proper for him to own it. 
Maviglio bought the stock for $12,000 and said he had lost $1,300 on it. 
News of his purchase came after Davis' office fired five consultants who helped negotiate state power contracts and held stock in energy companies. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry last week to determine whether Davis' consultants violated any security fraud laws. 
Vikram Budhraja, an energy consultant to the governor, received a letter from the SEC Wednesday, asking for documents relating to Budhraja's stock transactions since Jan. 1, said Budhraja's lawyer Stephen Kaufman. 
""We do not believe the SEC matter has any basis whatsoever,"" Kaufman told the Los Angeles Times. ""And the documentation will show in no uncertain terms that Mr. Budhraja was never involved in insider trading.""

DEEP POCKETS OF THE ENERGY COMPANIES

FOLLOW THE money: that is the simple principle explaining how the US House of Representatives approved President Bush's controversial plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. 
Congressional members were heavily swayed by the backing they received from oil, gas, coal and other energy companies. The energy sector contributed nearly $65m (pounds 45m) to congressional races in the run-up to last year's elections, 75 per cent of it going to Republicans.
Among the recipients was Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana representative who co-sponsored the energy bill in the House. He received $180,393, while his three co-sponsors received more than $200,000 between them. The average House Democrat received just $8,393 from the oil and gas industry, but the 36 who voted in favour received an average of $17,074. 
Controversy has also raged over the number and identity of energy industry lobbyists canvassed by the White House's special energy taskforce, headed by Vice President Dick Cheney, when it drew up the plan and proposed oil exploration in the Arctic earlier this year. 
Several media organisations have launched lawsuits to try to pressure Mr Cheney into releasing the information. US press reports suggest that figures such as Kenneth Lay, the chief executive of the Texas energy producer Enron and a major Bush contributor, played a key role in writing the policy.

India's State-run Oil Companies Cut Naphtha Price, Paper Says
2001-08-02 23:47 (New York)


     New Delhi, Aug. 3 (Bloomberg) -- India's state-run oil
companies such as Indian Oil Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp.
cut the price of naphtha even as international crude prices fell,
the Business Standard reported, without citing sources.
     Naphtha, used by Enron Corp.'s Dabhol power plant to produce
electricity, is now cheaper by 5 percent or 660 rupees ($14) a
ton. The petroleum companies, however, increased the price of
furnace oil by 3 percent or 250 rupees for 1,000 liters. The new
prices took effect Wednesday, the paper said.
     The price cut in naphtha may have been the result of a recent
decline in international crude oil prices, analysts said. Dated
Brent Crude fell to $25.67 a barrel yesterday from $29.34 on June
11, and 32 percent below a one-year high of $37.73 last September.
     This is the second month oil companies reduced the price of
naphtha, which is the key raw material for Reliance Industries
Ltd., India's biggest non-state company by sales. However,
Reliance hasn't been able to benefit from sliding naphtha prices
as its product prices dropped faster in the quarter ended June 30,
hurting margins.


India won't commit to new round of trade talks until WTO corrects imbalances
By RAJESH MAHAPATRA

NEW DELHI, India (AP) - India won't commit to a new round of trade talks until the World Trade Organization corrects imbalances in existing agreements, the country's commerce minister said ahead of a crucial visit by the U.S. trade representative. 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick will meet with Commerce and Industry Minister Murasoli Maran and other officials next Wednesday to discuss trade ties and a possible new round of global trade negotiations later this year.
Like most developing countries around the world, India is opposed to a new round of talks proposed by the United States and the European Union because it believes the industrialized nations are benefitting more from the existing agreements than Third World members. 
""We are not going to talk about a new round at all,"" Maran told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday. 
""We cannot say that benefits of the Uruguay round are equal. There are a lot of ... imbalances. Unless they are addressed to the satisfaction of developing countries, it will be difficult to go further."" 
Most developing countries maintain that the Uruguay round of negotiations, which led to the formation of the WTO, has left the poorer countries belonging to the 141-member trade group with too many difficult commitments and not enough in return. 
They complain that the developed countries have raised more non-tariff barriers, while developing countries have had to reduce tariffs, open up their economies to foreign investment and impose patent rules which have heavily burdened some of their industries. 
The United States is keen to get developing countries interested in launching renewed trade liberalization, and as one of the largest and most important developing countries, India's support would help. 
India, however, insists the WTO should first sort out the implementation issues. 
There are differences over implementation of agreements relating to intellectual property rights, agricultural subsidies and trade related investment measures. The WTO is trying to sort out these differences. 
""There is an impression given as if there is no agenda before the WTO. There is a big agenda which contains 200 items. We have not moved an inch on them,"" Maran said. ""They are stonewalling the implementation issues."" 
The WTO held a meeting in Geneva earlier this week ahead of the November meeting of WTO trade ministers in Doha in Qatar. After the meeting, WTO Director General Mike Moore said the situation was fragile. 
""The real reality check is that WTO is not prepared for a new round of talks. We should stick to mandated negotiations ... and implementation issues,"" said Maran, who met Zoellick in Washington two weeks ago. 
After his meeting with Maran, Zoellick told reporters that the United States could help smooth differences between developing countries and the European Union and Japan, both of which support bringing investment and competition policy to the negotiating table. 
""Zoellick is a friend of India and a friend of developing countries. I am sure he will empathize with us,"" said Maran. 
Zoellick's trip will mark the first Cabinet-level visit by a Bush administration official to India. 
Maran said he was looking forward to Zoellick's visit to further strengthen trade relations between the two countries. 
""There was a paradigm shift in our relations with U.S. during Clinton's time which should be strengthened further,"" he said, adding that the United States and India have many common trade interests, such as information technology and agriculture. 
However, several thorny issues will be put before Zoellick. 
India likely will express concern over President Bush's decision to investigate whether protection against steel imports is necessary. India has become a major exporter of steel to the United States, provoking the U.S. steel industry to demand higher duties on Indian steel. Enron Corp.'s decision to pull out of a power project in western India following a payment dispute may also be raised. The conflict has left American investors skeptical about investing in India.

INDIA PRESS: Reliance Not Interested In Buying Dabhol Pwr

08/03/2001
Dow Jones Asian Equities Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) isn't interested in buying U.S. energy major Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Dabhol Power Co., the Hindu Business Line reports quoting Reliance Industries Managing Director Anil Ambani. 
""Nothing much is happening in the power sector as a whole. At this point of time, we are focussing on our expansion plans, especially our oil and (natural) gas and telecom businesses,"" the newspaper quoted Ambani as saying.
Ambani said it was ""too premature"" to look at the Dabhol project. In the power sector, he said, Reliance was focussing on its Jamnagar plant, located in the western Indian state of Gujarat. 
The Dabhol plant is located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.

298,"Please respond to As I mentioned earlier this week, my associate Cliff Berg, representing AOL,
co-sponsored a meeting in our office today regarding AB 256 (Wayne).  The
meeting was run by Kay Caldwell on behalf of the Internet Alliance.  Kay was
the one who contacted Jeff Dodd in Houston who I believe contacted one or
both of you.

The bill is being opposed by AOL, Microsoft, Charles Schwab, CMTA, Chamber,
GTE/Verizon, AEA, Retailers, Financial Services Association and the Internet
Alliance.  All of those parties are scheduled to meet with Assembly Member
Wayne at different times on Wednesday to try and get him to drop the bill
which is being sponsored by the Attorney General.  In the event that fails,
the group is also trying to get the bill double-referred to the Senate
Banking Committee where they have a much better chance of stopping it versus
the Senate Judiciary Committee.  The bill will be heard by the Judiciary
Committee on August 21.

With respect to Enron's participation in any opposition effort, there was
some concern that the Judiciary Committee may not be the best place because
Peace is on that committee and would likely do anything to get at Enron
(support?).  Regardless of anyone's concerns we could submit a letter of
opposition so long as someone provides me with the general framework.

As of this point in time, the CPUC is NOT expected to vote tomorrow. The CPUC has not said when a new meeting would be held.  Although we continue to keep the pressure on, the CPUC vote could be for DA suspension as of July 1.  We need to be prepared to take immediate legal action in that event.  Here is the plan and what we'd like from customers.

Within a few hours of a CPUC vote, we plan to file at the CPUC for an emergency stay and request for rehearing. As part of that filing, we would need to include all of  the points we would raise in the court and declarations from each individual aggrieved party.   The decalarations would be held completely confidential by the attorney, transmitted directly through our outside attorney and would be filed under protective seal at the Commission.  The attorneys are preparing a pro-forma declaration that each party can use to prepare their own. I will e-mail that as soon as I have it. The draft court case is attached.  It will form the basis for our CPUC filing.
We would expect the CPUC to ignore the filing.  If the Commission failed to act on our request by the next regularly scheduled meeting, we would file in court immediately. We would use the same declarations and much of the same filing info in the court case.
To the extent we have customers on our filings, we have a much better shot at winning. I have gotten agreements form a number of other ESPs who will join with us.  They are: APSES, Strategic Energy, AES/New Energy, American Utility Network, and perhaps Commonwealth. Each of these, in turn, is working to get some of their customers to sign on. I am working with UC's attorney to see if they will join.
Our strategy is similar if the Legislature enacts a law with a retroactive date.  The major differences are that we would go directly to court and we would have to wait until the bill was signed by the Governor. Some of our ESP and customer friends would likely drop off at that point, because they have less financial harm from an Aug 25 date.
If you have customers intersted in signing on, please let me know.  The customer may contact me or the attorneys directly.  Here is contact info:

National crisis eclipses energy woes 
State's bond sale, as well as Edison bailout, could be casualties of Wall Street turmoil. 
September 13, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- Terrorist attacks that disrupted Wall Street could further delay California's plan to help itself - and Southern California Edison - recover from the energy crisis, experts said Wednesday. 
Among other things, a $12.5 billion bond sale - designed to repay the state for billions it spent buying emergency electricity - could be delayed until next year, one legislative leader said Wednesday, although others expect a shorter wait. The $12.5 billion in borrowing would be the largest municipal bond sale in U.S. history. It was expected to happen next month, after several earlier postponements. 
Putting it off means that if the state's credit rating drops within the next few months, the interest rate on the bond repayment would be higher. Delays on the sale beyond Oct. 31 could cost ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars in interest on another loan the state has already taken. 
Several pieces of California's recovery plan are still in play as the Legislature heads toward a scheduled Friday adjournment and Wall Street's attention is on other matters. A summary: 
Terrorist attacks forcing the temporary closure of Wall Street could slow down getting the $12.5 billion in energy bonds being marketed. 
""There certainly is a direct impact on Wall Street,"" said David Freeman, the head of the new California Power Authority. ""If the place that is going to loan you money nearly got bombed out, you have to assume that things won't move at the same pace that they would have. But I think that will be a short-term delay."" 
But a top legislator disagrees. 
""We're looking at January at the earliest and probably later,"" Jaime Fisfis, spokesman for Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox, said, referring to the $12.5 billion sale. 
Another factor, not related to the terrorist attacks, also is conspiring to delay the sale. The PUC's long-awaited decision of whether to sign off on a crucial piece of the bond sale was to be made today. But PUC President Loretta Lynch says the proposal is complex and requires a longer look, perhaps until Sept. 20. The PUC's approval is needed before the bonds can be marketed. 
The state took out a short-term loan of $4.3 billion to cover energy costs while a larger bond sale was developed. 
But that loan, which was to be paid back with the bond money, has a sharp interest penalty if it isn't paid off by Oct. 31. After that, the interest rate rises from the original 4.14 percent to about 7 percent - which means the state would have to cover an additional $123 million to pay back the loan. 
Many, even in Gov. Gray Davis' administration, believe missing the Oct. 31 deadline is likely. 
""I wouldn't be a bit shocked by that,"" said Steven Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. 
Two unrelated bond sales, one for $5.7 billion and the other for $500 million, have been postponed for at least a couple of weeks because of the New York attacks. State officials say they want to wait to go to market with the two bond sales, both routine, until the turmoil in the East settles down. 
The proposed bailout of Edison also could be hurt by the New York attacks, said one energy expert, who noted that lawmakers have only until midnight Friday to act on the plan, which might include financing the utility's debt with bonds. If the Legislature adjourns without providing help to Edison, it is widely believed the utility will go into bankruptcy. 
""I believe the Edison bailout package is now nonexistent,"" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents energy producers. 
Maviglio disagreed, saying the rescue plan will rise or fall on its own. 
""I don't think there's any effect"" on the bailout, he said. 


No confidentiality for energy producers
By Claire Cooper
Bee Legal Affairs Writer
(Published Sept. 13, 2001) 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Energy generators were rebuffed Wednesday in an attempt to force state Attorney General Bill Lockyer not to disclose marketing data he has subpoenaed from them. 
Without comment or dissent, the California Supreme Court voted not to review lower court decisions allowing the attorney general to share the data with others looking into possible manipulation of energy supplies, including state regulators, federal prosecutors and officials in Oregon and Washington state. 
In May, three generators -- Dynegy, Reliant and Mirant -- agreed to turn over the subpoenaed documents to Lockyer. Lockyer, in turn, agreed not to share them, pending court review of the companies' confidentiality claim. 
A Los Angeles trial judge ruled against all three companies. Reliant and Mirant took the issue to the state Court of Appeal and lost there. Only Reliant then appealed to the state Supreme Court, which considered and turned down the appeal at its weekly closed-door case conference. 
Deputy Attorney General Hiren Patel said it would have been absurd if Lockyer, California's chief law enforcement officer, could not divulge unlawful activity to appropriate authorities. 
He said that while some generators have been turning over the subpoenaed documents, Reliant recently reneged on its promise to do so. 
John Pernick, Reliant's lawyer, said he would have ""no comment at this time.""


UCLA: Power Crisis Damage To Calif Economy Seen Lessened

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California's energy crisis will drain the state's economy of billions of dollars, but will have a smaller impact than previously thought, said Christopher Thornberg, economist and co-author of a report issued Wednesday by the University of California at Los Angeles' Anderson Business Forecast team. 
The difference can be largely chalked up to consumers paying less for electricity than was expected, he said. 
In our last paper, we said that, given the price of power and what we expected people to consume, rate increases would have a 1.7% drain on the economy,"" Thornberg said. ""Now we think it will be a one-half percent drain."" 
That translates to $5 billion lost yearly because of the electricity crisis, compared to June's estimate of $17 billion. The state's economy produces $1.2 trillion per year. 
Much of the state's lost dollars will come from a decline in consumer and business spending in reaction to higher electricity rates, the report said. The California Public Utilities Commission passed a 3 cent per kilowatt hour rate hike for customers of PG&E Corp (PCG </investments/quotes/?symbol=PCG>, news </investments/news/?symbol=PCG>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=PCG>) unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Edison International (EIX </investments/quotes/?symbol=EIX>, news </investments/news/?symbol=EIX>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=EIX>) unit Southern California Edison in March, and is expected to pass a similar increase for Sempra (SRE </investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news </investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) unit San Diego Gas and Electric Co. soon. 
""The costs imposed on ratepayers by the state's PUC will reduce economic growth from what it otherwise would be,"" the report said. ""These costs will total billion of dollars annually, and will significantly reduce consumer and business spending for other goods and services."" 
Still, the state was spared the cost of a widely-anticipated summer electricity crisis, Thornberg noted. 
The UCLA team's last report, in June, predicted that the summer would bring 36 hours of blackouts and sky-high wholesale power prices, dealing a concentrated blow to the state's economy. But the summer crisis failed to materialize due to mild weather, conservation efforts and a federal price control order that has brought wholesale prices down, the report said. 
""(The energy crisis) is in the process of being converted from a short-term crisis into a longer-term vexation which will nag us with a combination of higher energy prices, shakier public credit, bankrupt utilities, and fewer choices in how state revenues will be expended,"" the report says. 
Because wholesale prices have declined so dramatically, the UCLA team no longer predicts the state will be have $17 billion in debt in 2005 due to the energy crisis, Thornberg said. A co-author of the June report said that utility ratepayer revenue would not be enough to repay a $13.4 billion revenue bond sale planned by the state to smooth out its power purchases. That's no longer the case, Thornberg aid. 
""Under the current circumstances, I'd say there will be enough in retail rates to pay the state for power"", he said. 
The costs California has been spared by the lack of a summer electricity crisis will be offset by the effects of the national recession and global economic slump, the report said. Personal income, which accounts for more than 80% of gross state product, slowed to 4% in the second quarter of 2001 from 13% in the third quarter of 2000. Unemployment has risen from 4.5% in February to 4.9% in July, and will hit 6% in 2002, the report said. 
""Although California's economy is not clearly in recession at this point, most indicators of the job market show an end to the expansion,"" the report said. 



PG&E Says California Power Cost Request Is Illegal, Overstated
By Dennis Walters 
San Francisco, Sept. 12 (Bloomberg) -- PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility, said a proposed plan to let the state sell $12.5 billion bonds for its power costs is illegal and overstates how much money the state needs. 
The comments came in a filing with the California Public Utilities Commission, which is considering a plan for repaying the state for power purchases. California's Department of Water Resources plans to sell the bonds, the largest municipal debt offering in U.S. history, to repay the state's general fund for loans and to cover other power costs. 
The proposed plan is ``blatantly arbitrary, discriminatory, and unlawful'' and should be rejected, Pacific Gas & Electric said in its filing. 
The water department this year has spent more than $8.6 billion buying power on behalf of the PG&E unit and Edison International's Southern California Edison, the state's No. 2 utility. The utilities became insolvent after buying power at higher costs than they could charge customers under California law. 
In a rush to give the water department a ``blank check,'' the regulator proposes illegally shifting $600 million of costs to Pacific Gas from customers in Southern California, the filing said. Echoing past complaints by the utility, the filing also said the water department has overestimated power costs and should face public hearings over its revenue request. 
Southern California Edison, in comments filed with the PUC today, also disagreed with parts of the proposed plan. Edison said the plan would ``effectively set a fixed rate'' for its own generating plants and contracts with alternative-energy providers, raising the risk that the utility wouldn't recover all its costs under certain circumstances. 
PG&E's utility filed for bankruptcy protection in April. California lawmakers are debating a rescue plan for Edison's utility. 
The PUC, citing the disruption caused by yesterday's terrorist attacks, has postponed a vote on the power plan that had been scheduled for tomorrow. The commissioners will reschedule the vote at tomorrow's meeting.

Developments in California's energy crisis: 
THURSDAY:
- No power alerts Thursday as electricity reserves remain above seven percent. 
WEDNESDAY: 
- State energy regulators said they'll delay a vote on a plan that cedes the Public Utilities Commission's ratemaking authority to the state Department of Water Resources. The PUC still plans to meet Thursday, but the commissioners will choose a new date, possibly for next week, to vote on the plan, said Terri Prosper, PUC spokeswoman. 
- The attacks at the nation's financial center delayed two bond issues for the state of California, one totaling $5.7 billion, but won't have much affect on the state's biggest project - $12.5 billion to repay the state's general fund for energy purchases. 
- State Auditor Elaine Howle said the California National Guard and Office of Emergency Services each have weaknesses in their blackout preparation procedures. 
- An executive with the city's Department of Water and Power, Tom LaBonge, and a former Los Angeles Community College District leader, Beth Farfield, appeared headed for an October runoff for a seat on the Los Angeles City Council. 
THE PROBLEM: 
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. 
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June 2000 to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. 
Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state also is buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also is struggling with high wholesale power costs. 
The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37 percent for the heaviest residential customers and 38 percent for commercial customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

Calif PUC Won't Vote Thu On $12.5B Rev-Bond-Related Items

09/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Public Utilities Commission won't vote Thursday on items related to the state's sale of $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, a spokeswoman for CPUC president Loretta Lynch said Wednesday. 
The CPUC will either meet Friday, or wait until its next scheduled meeting Sept. 20 to discuss the items, she said.
The items had already been postponed from Sept. 6. 
The postponed items include a rate agreement that would allow the state Department of Water Resources to recover power-buying costs without regulatory review, and an item that would establish how much revenue the DWR can receive for power purchases through 2002. 

The CPUC will still hold its meeting Thursday, but won't be taking any votes, commission spokeswoman Terrie Prosper said. The commission will announce Thursday when it will have its next meeting. 
""We are trying to coordinate the commissioners' schedules to see when they can meet next week,"" Prosper said. 
The votes are being delayed as a result of the closure of the commission's offices Tuesday after terrorist attacks on the East Coast. Tuesday's deadline to file comments on the DWR revenue requirement order has also been extended to Wednesday at 5 p.m. PDT (0000 GMT Thursday). 
The CDWR has been buying power on behalf of the state's investor-owned utilities since January. CPUC votes on the proposed decisions are crucial to the state's plans to sell a record $12.5 billion in revenue bonds later this autumn. The bonds will be used to repay about $6 billion borrowed from the state's general fund, and a $4.3 billion bridge loan for power purchases. 
State Treasurer Philip Angelides has said he will comment on any revision to the bond sale's timetable after the CPUC takes all necessary votes. 
The postponement of bond-related votes Thursday will also affect items dealing with the suspension of retail choice of electricity providers, and servicing agreements between the utilities and the DWR. A vote on a 12% rate hike for customers of Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric is also postponed. 



Calif Lawmakers Call For Federal Probe Of State Pwr Mkt
By Jason Leopold

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A dozen California Republican state senators called for a federal investigation into the state's grid operator and power buying arm, claiming the agencies may be manipulating the wholesale electricity market by understating the state's power needs in order to obtain a higher price out-of-market for its excess supply, according to a letter sent to the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
The letter signed by Senate Republican Minority Leader Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, Sen. Ray Haynes, R-Riverside, and others in the minority leadership, alleges the California Independent System Operator has understated the state's daily power needs in order to allow the Department of Water Resources to get a higher price for its excess electricity through ""out-of-market"" calls. 
The ISO maintains reliability of the grid and operates the spot market in California. The DWR is the agency that has been buying electricity since January in lieu of the state's struggling utilities and signed $43 billion in long-term power pacts. 
The ISO has denied the allegations, but the agency has come under fire for what some describe as market manipulation. 
""It could be argued that a higher price for excess electricity is needed for political reasons, because DWR has been selling power for a low as $1 per megawatt-hour, after entering into long-term contracts averaging $138 per megawatt-hour,"" the letter, sent to FERC Chairman Pat Wood. 
An aide to Wood said the letter has not yet been reviewed by the agency. 
The letter claims the ISO made numerous out-of-market sales for DWR power, ""especially"" in June. 
""Evidence indicates that the out-of-market calls, especially those in June of 2001, were many times larger than load imbalances."" 
ISO Confirms Market Dysfunctional 
Last week, an ISO spokesman said the agency's market ""was not working as it was designed to"" refusing to elaborate. 
The ISO may also be in violation of its federal regulations requiring it to make the cheapest power available in the state before turning to more expensive supplies. 
Fishman confirmed that the ISO has ""at times"" taken bids out of sequence, turning to higher priced power because the state can obtain the more expensive power quicker. 
In August, the ISO confirmed that it reduced power at low-cost power plants, possibly, to allow the DWR to keep its excess supply. 
The state's Big Five power generators also filed a complaint with FERC saying the ISO has failed to pay the companies $2 billion for electricity supplied since mid-January. 



State regulators delay decision on power rate agreement 

September 12, 2001 
SACRAMENTO - State energy regulators said Wednesday they'll delay a vote on a plan that cedes the Public Utilities Commission's ratemaking authority to the state Department of Water Resources. 
The PUC still plans to meet Thursday, but the commissioners will choose a new date, possibly for next week, to vote on the plan, said Terri Prosper, PUC spokeswoman. 
With most public offices closed Tuesday due to the terrorist attacks in Washington, D.C., and New York, many parties requested more time to file comments on the plan, Prosper said. That means PUC officials will also need additional time to review the comments, she said. 
The proposed agreement would let DWR pass on all power costs to customers without oversight by state regulators to ensure those costs are fair and reasonable. 
The DWR has been purchasing power for customers of three major utilities since January, when record-high wholesale energy costs brought the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy. One of the utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April. 
The other two, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are working with state officials on rescue plans that would let the utilities issue revenue bonds for their debts. 
Critics of the DWR draft rate agreement, which includes the utilities and several consumer groups, say the PUC plan would let the department raise customer rates to pay for energy costs. It would prevent the PUC from reviewing energy costs or contracts to ensure they were reasonable. 
DWR officials said they need that guarantee to attract investors when they sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds this fall. Ratepayers will pay off those bonds over 15 years, and state officials say a solid revenue stream could help keep interest low. 




State Faces Crunch Time to Deal With Electricity Costs
 Energy: With one week left in the legislative session, lawmakers and regulators want to resolve questions on how California will recoup its expenditures during power crisis.  After a summer of delays, California regulators and legislators are aiming in one final week to resolve issues crucial to millions of electricity customers and the financial stability of the state and its utilities.

The energy crisis that caused blackouts early this year has receded, but it has left behind a potential fiscal crisis. The state needs to recoup more than $8 billion that it has spent on power, and it has signed $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts.

Final plans for meeting these financial obligations--and spreading the pain of paying them off--have been debated for months. But the decision time has come: Legislators are scheduled to recess for the year on Friday, and the state Public Utilities Commission is under pressure to act on several long-pending measures at a meeting on Thursday. ""What's before the state, both at the PUC and the Legislature, is how are we going to provide power to people in the years to come,"" PUC President Loretta M. Lynch said in an interview. ""Are we going to have a healthy utility to provide the power, or are we going to rely on the state?""

The PUC, which approved the biggest rate increase in history earlier this year, now faces another tough choice: Should it surrender its formerly ironclad authority over electricity rates to the state Department of Water Resources, an agency that has come under fire for alleged conflicts of interest and the cost of its contracts? Or should it balk and jeopardize the state's planned sale of bonds to replenish the treasury and repay loans?

Legislation on Related Issues

Legislators are grappling with two complicated and highly contested bills on related issues. One seeks to repair the finances of Southern California Edison through a $2.9-billion aid plan backed by Gov. Gray Davis. The other would limit the powers of the Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for 10 million customers of Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric since January.

The state law that authorized the Department of Water Resources to buy power exempted the purchases from PUC reviews designed to protect consumers from unreasonable charges.

Now, the department is seeking a formal agreement with the PUC that would guarantee that its cost of supplying power to utility customers will be fully covered. Critics say the accord is a blank check for future rate increases, but the department says no increases will be necessary in the foreseeable future.

State officials say the PUC has little choice but to sign the agreement, which they see as necessary to reassure Wall Street bankers that the Department of Water Resources will be able to repay $12.5 billion in bonds the state plans to sell to cover power costs. The money from those bonds will go, in part, to repay the state treasury for money laid out for power.

Top state officials, including the governor and treasurer, want the bond sale to go without a hitch, but the date of the sale already has been pushed back several months, and threatened litigation could further delay it.

The urgency over the bonds comes about because the state already has used $6 billion from the treasury and has taken out a $4.3-billion loan to cover power costs.

State Treasurer Phil Angelides said that if the bonds are unsold and the economy slows down next year, the state could be revisiting the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s.

""People ought to be laying down their arms over their energy agendas and asking the question: What is the best and fastest way to repay the state general fund to ensure critical programs such as education and health get their funding?"" he said.

Lynch, one of three Davis appointees on the five-member PUC, finds herself in a particularly difficult position. She sees the value of PUC reviews of the reasonableness of power purchases. But, Lynch said, ""If we do not enter into a rate agreement, the bonds do not issue and that could affect the state general fund.""

""The thing I care about most,"" she added, ""is ensuring the general fund is repaid.""

Earlier this month, Lynch issued a draft decision that would have the PUC essentially rubber-stamp any future revenue requests or rate increases sought by the Department of Water Resources. But she also has publicly endorsed a bill by state Sen. John Burton (D-San Francisco) that the Davis administration opposes.

The bill would ensure that the PUC has the right to scrutinize the revenue needs of the Department of Water Resources and hold public hearings. It would not, however, give the PUC the power to disallow department expenses. To reassure Wall Street, the bill would dedicate a portion of the money that utilities collect from their customers to repaying the bonds.

At a PUC meeting last Thursday, PUC commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque, appointees of former Gov. Pete Wilson, voiced support for the Burton bill, saying it would let the PUC shed additional light on the Department of Water Resources' power-related expenditures.

The Davis administration opposes the bill's present form but is seeking amendments. One concern is that energy providers would sue out of fear that if money runs short, bondholders would be paid before they are.

The bill's passage could be a ""deal breaker"" for the bond sales, said contractor Joseph Fichera, a financial advisor to Davis.

At the least, contentious debate surrounding energy-related issues could drive up the price of floating bonds, Fichera said.

""Wall Street does not like risk. Conflict implies risk. So the more we create, the more we are costing ratepayers,"" he said.

The Legislature also is considering a bill that would allow Edison to sell bonds to pay off about three-quarters of the debt it accrued during the energy crisis. The utility would have to handle on its own about $1 billion owed to large energy companies. Consumer activists have threatened a ballot initiative to block the bill, which they call a bailout.

The PUC on Thursday is scheduled to vote on several items designed to ease the sale of the Department of Water Resources' bonds. One is a rate increase for SDG&E customers. Another measure would suspend the right of businesses and other electricity customers to stop buying electricity from their local utility and choose their own power provider.

The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, an organization that includes many large California businesses, said its members would be forced to sue if the PUC goes ahead with plans to retroactively void the right of customers to choose their own energy providers.

But the most controversial item has been the proposed PUC agreement with the Department of Water Resources. Consumer groups and utilities alike have called for public examinations of the department's contracts and revenue requirements.

""The plan would allow a state agency to operate behind closed doors while it negotiates with ratepayers' money,"" said Douglas Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""Secrecy in DWR leads to conflicts of interest and that leads to higher rates.""

Concerns about the Department of Water Resources' lack of independent oversight have been heightened by recent developments:

Energy experts have questioned the qualifications of the trading team the department assembled, and several traders were fired for alleged conflicts of interest.

Critics seized on reports that the department sold surplus power at a loss of $46 million in July, although officials say surpluses are bound to occur with long-term power contracts.

And the department's projections of its revenue needs for future power purchases have been updated and amended twice, prompting utilities and others to question the reliability of the figures.

PG&E Threatens to Sue Over Revenue

The utilities want the department to be subject to the sort of reviews that have rankled them for years. If the PUC does not provide for that, lawsuits could be coming.

PG&E, which already is in bankruptcy, has threatened to sue if the Department of Water Resources' revenue requirement doesn't leave the utility a sufficient share of the rate increase adopted by state regulators in March.

PG&E recently asked a Sacramento County Superior Court judge to require the Department of Water Resources to hold public hearings on its revenue requirements. The company has reacted angrily to a draft PUC decision to shift $600 million of the state's cost of buying power from Edison to PG&E, saying the plan was illegal and discriminates against PG&E customers.

Davis aides have defended the Department of Water Resources and its power purchases, saying the department's long-term contracts helped cool the energy crisis.

""They look overpriced now,"" Fichera said. ""But four months ago they were underpriced [compared with the spot market]. They are an insurance policy"" against market volatility.

Having the PUC review actions of another state agency would be redundant and would serve no purpose, Fichera said, because the contracts already are in place.

""You can't break contracts,"" he said. ""You've got to pay them.""

Even some critics acknowledge it is difficult to evaluate the Department of Water Resources' performance to date. One reason is that the department has closely guarded details about its contracts and its spot purchases, arguing that release of too much information would place it at a competitive disadvantage.

Another reason is that market conditions have changed and natural gas prices have declined since the department entered into contracts amid the energy crisis.

""We all have 20-20 hindsight,"" said PUC Commissioner Bilas. ""When DWR entered into contracts, the state was over the barrel. Now we can say that they are not as good as [the department] thought . . . and that DWR does a lousy job of negotiating contracts. But that's unfair.""

- a specific alignment with the contracts we signed in August
- those clients we are marketing to, and can't sign a new contract due to the suspension
- existing clients whom we are risk with if there are ANY restrictions on extensions

PLAYING AN 'UNUSUAL' ROLE, LANGDON PICKS THROUGH EL PASO RECORD
Handed the unusual task of independently assessing the strength of El Paso Corp.'s defense in the
California capacity complaint case, Washington attorney Jim Langdon for weeks has been searching for
relevant issues that may have been ignored or overlooked by the litigants. And he thinks he may have
stumbled onto a critical matter involving substantial volumes of storage gas that sat unused during the
critical months of the California energy crisis.
What Langdon suspects is that the complainant in the case (RP00-241), the California Public Utilities
Commission, may have only itself to blame for some of the pressure that built up in the gas market during
the months of the controversial large-volume capacity contract between El Paso Natural Gas Co. and
affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy Co.
Langdon, a partner in the Washington office of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP, in late July was
hired by El Paso President and Chief Executive William Wise to conduct a separate legal analysis of the
record in the case (IF, 27 Aug, 1). The idea was ""not to second-guess the lawyers litigating the case,"" but
rather to ""think dispassionately about the events of last year"" and give Wise ""an independent view"" of the
behavior of the El Paso companies before and during the 15-month contract for 1.22 Bcf/day of capacity to
California, Langdon explained last week.
Wise's decision to hire Langdon was eye-catching on a few levels. In his many years in law practice,
Langdon had never been retained to conduct the type of assessment Wise has asked for, Langdon told
Inside FERC, acknowledging ""this really was a little bit of an unusual request.""
Also drawing attention in this highly politicized case are Langdon's substantial administration connec-tions.
He was a major fundraiser for the Bush presidential campaign and his brother is Jerry Langdon, who as
a FERC commissioner in the early 1990s hired Chairman Pat Wood III as an adviser.
Is it fair to suggest that Langdon was brought on board by El Paso simply for name recognition
and the possibility that he may have some positive, collateral impact on the commission's ultimate
decision in this case?
That possibility ""didn't escape me"" at the time, Langdon admitted. ""I'll not pretend to be unaware
that there are these other connections with Wood and the president,"" he allowed, adding that ""that's
something that impacts everything I do. But what can I do? I have to practice law."" And, ""for the
record, I barely know Pat Wood.""
And how can this be considered an independent, third-party assessment if El Paso is paying for
Langdon's services? ""I recognize that there are critics and cynics"" who would suggest that Langdon is
simply a hired gun, ""but at the end of the day, . . . I'll have to stand behind"" the report. He vowed to
""call it the way I see it.""
His final report to Wise won't be ready for several weeks, but Langdon shared some of his initial
thoughts and findings.
Langdon has been looking hard at the circumstances surrounding the operation of three Southern
California Gas Co. storage facilities - the Montebello and Aliso Canyon fields in Los Angeles County
and the La Goleta field in Santa Barbara County. During the period that roughly coincides with the El
Paso/El Paso Merchant contract, SoCal Gas had been pressing the CPUC to approve the release of large
volumes of storage gas from those fields, said Langdon. The state commission finally granted the requests
in June 2001, the month after termination of the contract, he related.
Release of working and cushion gas from the Montebello field and cushion gas from the Aliso
Canyon and La Goleta fields - an aggregate total of 41 Bcf - would have contributed more than 100,000
Dt/day of deliverability to the California gas market ""without adding any intrastate pipeline capacity,""
said Langdon. Characterizing California as a cul-de-sac on the interstate pipeline network, he stressed that
""storage is huge"" in moderating the market. When pipeline capacity is constrained, ""storage is a way to
take care of . . . these problems.""
And yet, the SoCal Gas applications ""clearly languished"" at the CPUC. ""There may be very good reasons""
why the state commission took so long to allow release of the gas, but so far ""I don't understand how the CPUC
sits on a storage application like that during this time period when it's as significant as it is.""
For its part, the CPUC has argued during the case that El Paso Merchant caused gas prices at the state
border to skyrocket by withholding some of its firm capacity on El Paso and that the pipeline dragged its
feet in developing the Line 2000 conversion project (IF, 14 May, 5). ""I'm trying not to sound like an
advocate in this thing,"" said Langdon, but ""I don't understand the CPUC's position in the case, . . . when
right in their own back yard they've got these storage issues.""
As for the allegations that El Paso and El Paso Merchant rigged the open season that led to award of the
contract and subsequently ""withheld massive amounts of capacity"" from the market, ""we've reached the
conclusion that we don't see that kind of evidence in what's been presented"" so far in the proceeding, said
Langdon. His team of lawyers is looking closely at ""the maze of engineering issues"" that could hold the
answer to the capacity withholding issue.
Langdon all but dismissed the affiliate-abuse charges as the product of badly outdated regulations
colliding with unreasonable expectations about how integrated companies should operate in the evolving
energy market. Order 497, the marketing-affiliate rule, was first promulgated in 1986, he noted.
In most industries, such conflict-of-interest rules are constantly revised to keep pace. But here, the
gas industry has ""been turned on its head more than any industry I can think of, and yet these rules are the
very same ones"" that have been in effect largely unchanged for nearly 15 years. ""They absolutely need to
be updated, end of sentence, end of paragraph,"" said Langdon.
Despite statements during the hearing by Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. about
the strength of the El Paso case, Langdon said he was ""not at all concerned about the company not
getting a fair shake"" at the commission. Much of what Wagner had to say ""has been sensationalized to
a degree"" in the press, he said, adding that ""what happens in the press and what happens at FERC are
two different things.""
Langdon admitted that he would be ""a little concerned"" about Wagner's remarks ""if I were litigating
the case."" The judge has used some ""pretty strong language"" to suggest that the El Paso companies were
out of line. But FERC ""historically has been a very record-oriented tribunal,"" and ""in this case, the record
looks very sound,"" he said. - Chris Newkumet",Jim Langdon Langdon Gump William Wise Bush Jerry Langdon Pat Wood III Wood Pat Wood Curtis Wagner Jr. Wagner Chris Newkumet,,"FYI EL PASO El Paso Corp.'s the California Public Utilities

Jeff,

I have attached a file showing the SCE receivable amount of ($109,292,004.75) Due Enron.  This amount is net of the payments made by SCE.  A few cautions, these amounts are reported more by Enron accounting month vs. utility bill cycle month.  But at least it highlights the rapid fall off starting in the March, when most of the customers had been returned to Bundled Utility Service. 

To obtain a more accurate projection of the receivable as of January 18, 2001 or at any point would require this information be sorted differently and require allocation assumptions to handle the bill cycle vs. accounting vs. PX end date. 

Hopefully this will be enough to get you ready for Monday's meeting.  Call me if you would like to discuss.  FYI, I have also included information re PG&E.   If you are asked, these amounts are directly from the utility bills, not an Enron's calculation.  

We have not really tried to ""tie"" these numbers with the utility, but in all cases these amounts were pulled directly from the utility bills.  Any errors would be due to omissions or query compilation errors.  EES could be prepared to actually reconcile these with SCE, if you give the go-ahead to do so.   

Let me know what you think, or if you need anything else.  If you follow Rick's suggestion, it might be a short meeting anyway.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL: Energy groups' earnings likely to be hit hard 
Financial Times; Oct 15, 2001
By JULIE EARLE

Disintegrating oil and gas prices are set to weigh on third-quarter earnings for US energy companies due this week. 
Oil drillers, which have been pummelled in recent months as energy companies scale back on drilling and exploration in response to lower commodity prices and the terrorist attacks, are likely to report sharply lower third-quarter earnings and could issue further profits warnings, analysts said. 
Oil prices have slumped to Dollars 26.50 a barrel, from Dollars 31.58 a barrel in the year-ago quarter and natural gas prices slid in the third quarter to Dollars 2.63 MMBtu (million British thermal units) from Dollars 4.31 MMBtu in the same quarter a year ago, and from Dollars 4.19 MMBtu at the start of 2001. 
A slowdown in activity in the gas-rich Gulf of Mexico following the September 11 terrorist attacks is also likely to hit offshore drillers' earnings in the next six months. 
Global Marine, which is being acquired by Sante Fe International to create the second-biggest offshore drilling contractor, is due to report today. Consensus estimates were for 33 cents a share. Sante Fe International is also due to report today. 
Salomon Smith Barney expects North American spending on drilling to fall by 20 per cent in 2002, with spending outside North America to rise by 10 per cent to 15 per cent. 
Mark Urness, an SSB analyst, said earnings estimates for most drillers remained too high for the fourth quarter and needed to be cut. ""We are expecting them to provide lower guidance for 2002 as third quarter earnings are reported,"" he said. 
On the exploration and production front, Bill Featherstone, a UBS analyst, said fourth-quarter results for companies including Devon and Apache would also be hit by weak oil and gas prices. ""Obviously fourth- quarter results will trend down for the sector given reduced oil and natural gas prices,"" he said. 
Companies will need to show financial discipline and outline policies of keeping their spending in line with operating cash flow. Analysts are likely to look closely at capital expenditure budgets. 
Energy trader Dynegy also reports today, followed by rivals Enron and Duke Energy tomorrow.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL: Tata in talks to buy Enron power plant 
Financial Times; Oct 15, 2001
By SHEILA MCNULTY and KHOZEM MERCHANT

Tata, the Indian conglom-erate, has held exploratory talks to buy a controversial power plant from Enron, the US energy giant. 
Tata Power, part of the Bombay-based industrial group, has written to the Indian government expressing interest in the plant, which is India's biggest foreign investment. However, it said any deal would have to address the high tariff structure and interest rate burden on the project. 
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive and chairman, told the Financial Times in August that Enron and its partners wanted to retrieve the Dollars 1bn incurred building the now-defunct Dabhol plant. 
It is understood that Enron is considering an offer price of about 80 cents to the dollar. 
Enron declined on Friday to confirm it was in talks with Tata, but said the best solution would be for the Indian government, or one of its Indian financial backers, to take on Dabhol. 
Tata Power recently held talks with Indian financial institutions involved with the project. Officials from Dabhol Power Company, Enron's Indian arm, also attended. 
About 70 per cent of the Dabhol plant was funded by debt, with Indian financial institutions providing Dollars 1.4bn and foreign lenders the balance. Enron's Indian unit defaulted in September on interest payments to international lenders, blaming stopped payments by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the plant's sole client. 
Analysts favour a quick sale. ""Tata would be a faster exit and resolve it once and for all,"" said Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg. ""It is better to take a small loss and move along. Dabhol periodically becomes a problem and an issue, and it depresses the stock."" 
Analysts said the fit between Tata and its putative target would be complementary, though it would probably stretch the company's balance sheet. 
The Tata group is already committed to a heavy capital expenditure of some Rs30bn (Dollars 625m) on power-related projects over the next three years. 
A further Rs9bn is slated for telecommunications and broadband projects.

Base Metals Traders Struggle In Tough Trading Conditions
By Wong Chia Peck
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

SYDNEY -(Dow Jones)- The spate of decisions by big-name participants to scale down or quit base metals trading last week didn't surprise participants in Asia, given the market's tough trading conditions, they said. 
In fact, should the current dismal conditions prevail for the next six months, more such announcements are likely, they added.
Their comments follow the recent decisions by prominent members of the London Metal Exchange to either downsize their base metals trading divisions or quit entirely. 
""Clearly, they, like us, are victims of reduced volumes,"" said a senior LME trader in Sydney, adding that all market participants are suffering from the declining throughputs and trade volumes. 
Figures from the LME's Web site show that the trading volumes for aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc fell a total 10.6% to 41,027,075 contracts for the first nine months of this year from the same period last year. 
""We're just seeing the beginning of it,"" a senior trader with a big U.S.-based trading house in Tokyo told Dow Jones Newswires Monday. 
Last week, N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd. said it would cease base metals trading except for its Australian business. 
Chairman Evelyn de Rothschild said in a statement, ""In light of difficult trading conditions in the base metals markets, we have concluded that our limited base metals operations are no longer viable."" 
ScotiaMocatta, the base metals trading unit of Toronto-based Bank of Nova Scotia (T.BNS), said it would cut staff as well as exit LME ring dealing. 
With ScotiaMocatta's exit, there will be 11 LME ring dealing members. These members have the exclusive right to trade in the open-outcry ring. 
Earlier, Houston-based Enron Metals said it would cut staff by 10%-20% in Europe, while associate broker clearing member Mitsui Bussan Commodities Ltd. in July ceased its market-making activities to focus on clearing and broking. 
The senior trader said he wasn't surprised by these developments and ominously projected more to come should the difficult trading conditions continue in the next six months. 
Market Not Pricing Future Demand 

""People are really not pricing any future demand"" into their positions, he said. 
One indication is the lack of forward pricing in LME's base metals contracts despite the current depressed prices, he said. 
With LME three-month copper and aluminum prices around 25% down from their levels at the start of the year, he would have expected to see forward buying following previous experience. 
""But if everybody's restructuring, you don't even know if you are going to be here into 2002, 2003,"" he said. 
Despite having tumbled to very low levels, analysts and market participants project further downside for base metals prices as they push back forecasts of a price recovery following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. 
One of Japan's trading giants, Marubeni Corp. (J.MRB), said Monday that the attacks have pushed back the timing of the aluminum market's recovery by two to three months. 
It also cut its forecasts for this year's trading range of the LME three-month aluminum contract to $1,250-$1,450 a metric ton, compared with last year's $1,451-$1,730/ton range. 
Indeed, the past few years have thrown base metals into extremely difficult trading conditions, traders said. 
Just as the Asian markets were recovering from the 1997 financial crisis, the U.S. economy sputtered to a halt, they said. The terrorist attacks Sept. 11 and the subsequent retaliation threw a spanner in the works, they added. 
The bellwether copper and aluminum contracts last week fell to their lowest levels in 28 months, while zinc prices also notched 14-year lows. Tin prices are at their lowest levels in 20 years. 
A prominent casualty is the world's largest combined lead and zinc producer, Australia's Pasminco Ltd. (A.PAS). 
Having to compete for business in such a tough environment, brokers have had to cut their commissions, said the Tokyo-based trader. 
Another Tokyo-based trader said buying interest has been thin, as buyers prefer to wait for lower prices. 
""There are buyers in the market, but their (price) targets are lower,"" he said. 
He added that the company he is with stopped trading for a week after hearing talk that Rothschild was scaling down its operations. 
At 1010 GMT, LME three-month copper was at $1,401/ton; three-month aluminum was at $1,302/ton; three-month zinc was at $791.50/ton and three-month tin was at $3,800/ton.

Software: A New Calculus for the New Economy
How reclassifying it as an investment boosts growth

The U.S. truly has seen the birth of a New Economy over the past several 
years.
That's one way to read the results of a comprehensive revision of historical
data on the gross domestic product released on Oct. 28 by the Commerce Dept.'s
Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The most stunning data in the report are about the acceleration of 
productivity
in the 1990s. Official revisions of productivity data, incorporating the 
latest
output figures from Commerce, won't be released by the Labor Dept. until Nov.
12. But a BUSINESS WEEK analysis of the new data from the Commerce Dept. shows
that nonfarm business productivity growth in this decade will likely be 
revised
upward, to roughly 2% a year, from 1.4%. Productivity growth will be boosted
for the 1980s as well, but not by as much (chart).

What's even more striking is the upward revision in productivity growth for 
the
last three years, from 1.9% to a stunning 2.6% rate. That explains how the 
U.S.
has been able to grow at a 4.2% rate over that stretch without creating
inflationary pressures.

KEEPS ON TICKING. While the rate of increase in economic output in the 1990s
isn't as impressive as the growth in productivity, it is not as low as the old
statistics indicated. From 1990 through 1998, the Commerce Dept. statisticians
say, the economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1%--about even with the 1980s
growth rate of 3.2%. And, the report confirms what everyone senses: Growth has
accelerated recently. Commerce revised the economy's growth rate for 1996-98
upward to an average of 4.2% from a previously reported 3.8%.

By comparison, annual average GDP growth for the entire 40-year span covered 
by
the revisions was pushed upward to 3.4% from 3.2%. The implication of the
revisions: The U.S. economy may now be able to sustain a higher rate of growth
without inflation than was previously believed.

The Commerce Dept. now says that the GDP last year was $8.76 trillion, which 
is
about $250 billion--or 3%--higher than previously believed. A new calculus for
software investments accounted for about two-thirds of the upward revision in
GDP. And since software sales are growing far faster than the economy as a
whole, adding them into the GDP raises the economy's official growth rate--and
will likely continue doing so for years to come.

Indeed, the biggest factor in the Commerce Dept.'s revisions is the new way of
accounting for software, the poster product of the New Economy. The government
now treats software purchases by business and government as investments, which
are part of GDP. Until now, the only software sales that counted toward GDP
were sales to consumers and the sale of software that came bundled with
computers and was included in the computer's purchase price. Now all software
sales are factored into the GDP figures.

The new treatment of software isn't just some statistical trick. Until now,
software spending by business and government was considered an expense, and
expenses are left out of GDP to avoid double-counting. For instance, it would
be double-counting to list the steel that goes into a car as part of GDP and
count the car, too.

But software is not consumed in the production of new goods and services. And
the government is acknowledging now that software shouldn't be considered an
expense such as steel or stationery. It's being reclassified as an investment,
like a machine tool, in recognition that it has a useful life of at least a
year.

PIGGY-BANK BLOAT. By recognizing software as an investment instead of an
expense, the Commerce Dept. also increases the national savings rate. Savings
are the mirror image of investment. While the national savings rate was 
revised
downward for 1959-73, it was revised upward for the years since. The biggest
revision was for the most recent year covered: 1998. The government now says
that total national savings were 18.8% of gross national product last year, a
jump of 1.5 percentage points from the previous calculation. Of that increase,
fully 90% was accounted for by the government's recognition of business and
government software purchases as an investment.

The Commerce Dept. also rejiggered the composition of the national savings
accounts, raising personal savings while lowering government savings by an
equal amount. That's because of a new way of accounting for government pension
plans, contributions to which are now considered a form of personal rather 
than
governmental savings.

The reshuffling means that the personal savings rate is now calculated as 3.7%
for 1998 instead of a previously reported 0.5%. The new methodology will
undoubtedly turn the current personal savings rate from negative to positive.
But since the government's savings fell by a corresponding amount, the
reshuffling had no impact on the overall national savings rate. And the
downward trend in personal savings is still in place. By the new measure, the
personal savings rate declined from 10.9% in 1982 to 3.7% last year, instead 
of
from 9% to 0.5% as had been previously reported.

KINDER HINDSIGHT. The GDP revisions were wide-ranging and included hundreds of
large and small tweaks. For instance, the government is now using a better way
to measure the value of banking services such as automated teller machines and
electronic funds transfers. That increases the sector's official output and
productivity. Also, new inflation measures developed by the Labor Dept. are
being incorporated all the way back to 1978, not just since 1995.

One footnote: The government now says the recession of 1990-91 was milder than
previously thought. From its peak in the second quarter of 1990 to its trough
in the first quarter of 1991, GDP fell 1.8%. The old figure was a 2.7% drop.

The Commerce Dept.'s rewrite of economic history doesn't mean that the Federal
Reserve can afford to be any less vigilant about inflation. Regardless of the
official growth rate, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has to keep his eye on the
same warning signs: tight job markets, busy factories, rising commodity 
prices.
The real significance is that government statistics are finally reflecting the
reality of the high-growth, high-productivity, low-inflation New Economy.

By Peter Coy in Washington


My comments:
        The article is a bit unclear on whether software was ever counted.  
The
key point is that the value of software not yet depreciated is a percent or 
2of
GDP.  Thus, GDP is a few % larger than the old accounting system that expensed
all software immediately.  Consider your own desktop: What % of your salary is
the market value of the software you have on the machine?  (Not the original
cost, as Word95 has a very low market cost, even if it was $500 4 years ago.)

I assume the view below is for EES in total and we have not yet made an 
attempt to match up credit by customer/meter to the forward T&D related to 
positions in our book for those customer.  Going on the thought that we will 
only be able to offset T&D with credits on a customer by customer basis we 
may not have the full $153.9MM to work with (i.e., we may have large credits 
on customers for which we only have a short contract life remaining and small 
credits on customers with a long life making up a larger portion of the 
$153.9MM below).   Am I thinking about this correctly?  Is it 
difficult/impossible to do that matching? 

Are there any new developments/thoughts on the credits/T&D being dealt with 
on a supplier basis (ie., EES) vs. a customer basis?

comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to 
take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly 
researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  
California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC 
(especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California 
politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of 
that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations 
at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

340,"Dear fellow evening students,
We are into the thick of golf tournament planning and are at the
moment considering opening the tournament up to the day students as well.
It was originally designed as a special recruiting and networking outlet for
the evening students only, but due to other circumstances, we may want to
combine our tournament with one the day program is also currently
considering.  A combined tournament may seriously limit the amount of
students that can play and I want to be sure that all evening students who
want to play are able to.  To help in estimating demand and making this
decision, I am asking you to respond to me with your intent to play or not
play given the following preliminary information......
Dates:  A Saturday or Sunday in late September/early October
Cost: $65-$80 per player
Location: A higher end golf course located in the South Bay, East Bay or
possibly even East of the Altamont Pass.

Please remember that golf skills are not required since it will be a
scramble format.  All I recommend is visiting a driving range a couple times
with instruction before heading out to the tournament (and borrowing or
renting a set of clubs).  Thanks for your time!

June 14, 2001
Vol. 3, No. 11
?
A Rock and a Hard  Place
?
Today, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) voted  3-0 to appro=
ve=20
a settlement=01*proposed by FirstEnergy, GPU, the Office of Consumer  Advoc=
ate,=20
the Industrial Intervenor groups and PennFuture=01*to resolve the =20
FirstEnergy/GPU merger and provider of last resort rate increase requests.=
=20
The  PUC was faced with a seemingly intractable choice: grant a rate increa=
se=20
that  violates the rate cap and risk unraveling every utility rate cap and=
=20
stranded  cost recovery decision in Pennsylvania, or just saying =01&no=018=
 and=20
risk=01*according  to GPU=01*creating a financially unstable distribution u=
tility.=20
In approving the  settlement, the PUC resolved the thorny issues raised by=
=20
the cases without  excusing GPU=01,s failure to adequately plan its provide=
r of=20
last resort service.  Considering the circumstances, the result is good for=
=20
consumers, the companies  and the environment.=20

But while Pennsylvania PUC approval was a major hurdle,  the New Jersey Boa=
rd=20
of Public Utilities must still approve the merger as well,  and such approv=
al=20
is anything but a sure thing.=20

Now that the PUC has made its decision, let=01,s break  through the rhetori=
c,=20
assess the real issues in the proceeding and see how the  settlement=20
addresses them.

The Problem
No matter who you are, how  you look at it, or who you might blame, the=20
fundamental problem in this case is  that GPU divested its generating asset=
s=20
in 1998 and failed to protect its  shareholders and customers from the=20
possibility of rising wholesale prices. In  fact, wholesale prices did rise=
,=20
the retail generation rate caps remained  intact, no competitive default=20
service was established, and GPU had insufficient  long-term or lower-price=
d=20
generation contracts in place. Alone among  Pennsylvania=01,s major utiliti=
es,=20
GPU was spending much more to buy wholesale  generation than it was paid to=
=20
sell that generation to its native load  customers.=20

The real problem then was that GPU was running out of cash  or credit to bu=
y=20
wholesale generation to meet its obligations. Although the  company as a=20
whole continued to fare well financially, it became clear only  towards the=
=20
end of the proceedings that the Commission and the public interest  require=
d=20
a solution which would enable GPU to continue to deliver provider of  last=
=20
resort generation service, and to do so without breaking the rate caps. If =
=20
the Commission didn=01,t find a solution by June 15, GPU could have been fr=
ozen=20
out  of the capital markets and would have come back to the Commission for=
=20
emergency  rate relief=01*requiring a whole new set of proceedings concerni=
ng=20
the same facts. =20

The Solution=20
The preferred solution  was to merge GPU and FirstEnergy and to establish a=
n=20
accounting deferral for GPU  energy costs. The merger is a good solution in=
=20
part because it overcomes the  cash flow necessary to buy generation on the=
=20
market. Any cash generated by a  modest rate increase trickles in over time=
=20
and is of secondary importance, so  any modest rate increase wasn=01,t goin=
g to=20
solve the problem.  FirstEnergy, a huge generation owner, can provide some =
of=20
the needed  generation=01*even at market prices=01*without requiring the GP=
U=20
utilities to pay cash  on time. With a merged company, there is plenty of=
=20
room for internal accounting  flexibility. And, as a huge wholesale=20
generation player, FirstEnergy can also  better manage wholesale purchasing=
.

The deferral is a good solution, too, because the rate  caps remain 100%=20
intact. Consumers won=01,t pay more for electricity. Finally, GPU  will be =
able=20
to re-enter the capital markets, and although they are given a  lifeline, G=
PU=20
shareholders are not taken off the hook for the company=01,s past  performa=
nce.

Thus, on May 24, 2001, the Commission approved the merger  itself and allow=
ed=20
GPU to establish deferral of generation expenses for  accounting purposes.=
=20
The issues to be addressed in the settlement, as directed  by the Commissio=
n=20
in its Order, concerned passing on merger-related benefits to  consumers an=
d=20
GPU=01,s generation costs. Today=01,s settlement addresses these  directive=
s by=20
extending the distribution rate cap from 2004 through 2007, rather  than=20

=20
expenses for the company and all consumers; and committing the company to =
=20
contribute $5 million now to the GPU Sustainable Development Funds and=20
invest  another $10 million in renewable energy projects.=20

How the Deferral Accounting Works=20
The  deferral provisions allow GPU to retain unrecovered generation costs o=
n=20
its  books until 2010 but doesn=01,t require GPU consumers to pay more as a=
=20
result. The  rate caps are left 100% intact. Some excess generation costs=
=20
will be reduced on  the company=01,s books if future energy prices decrease=
=20
sufficiently.=20

The settlement also increases the shopping credit  modestly, while=20
correspondingly reducing the Competitive Transition Charge  (CTC), so some =
of=20
the possible excess generation costs also may be recovered  from existing C=
TC=20
revenue, which otherwise would have been applied against  company stranded=
=20
costs. Doing so does not increase consumer payments, however,  because the=
=20
1998 GPU Restructuring Settlement allowed CTC collection to continue  as lo=
ng=20
as 2020, in order to take into account the unknown level of non-utility =20
generation (NUG) costs and divestiture proceeds that were a major portion o=
f =20
total GPU stranded costs.=20

The settlement cuts off CTC collection for GPU in 2015,  rather than=20
permitting CTC collection from Met Ed customers to continue until as  long =
as=20
2020. (Best current estimates are that the Met Ed CTC would have  continued=
=20
to about 2018.) Now, any stranded costs not recovered by 2015 must be =20
written off, reducing consumer payment of stranded costs. This will provide=
=20
a  modest improvement in the opportunity to shop and for a competitive mark=
et=20
to  develop. Any remaining excess generation costs must be written off by=
=20
2010. =20

The settlement also redefines the way that NUG stranded  costs are=20
calculated. Under the 1998 Restructuring Settlement, the amount by  which N=
UG=20
payments exceed the market value capped rate are stranded costs. As  change=
d,=20
only the portion of a NUG payment that exceeds the higher of the capped  ra=
te=20
or the market price is recoverable as stranded costs. This change corrects =
=20
what turned out to be an inaccurate assumption that the market price of =20
generation would always be below the capped rate, but it does not affect NU=
G =20
contracts in any way. The NUGs still get whatever they are entitled to unde=
r =20
their contracts without changes, and even benefit because their payor will =
=20
become the financially stronger merged FirstEnergy instead of GPU.=20

The Benefits
The primary, and crucial,  benefit to the consumer is that provider of last=
=20
resort generation service will  continue within capped rates. The primary=
=20
benefit to the company is that the  deferral accounting allows the company=
=20
maximum flexibility to recover costs and  to write off unrecovered costs.

But perhaps the most important aspect of the settlement is  that it=20
establishes a firm commitment and mechanism for FirstEnergy to address  the=
=20
underlying problem by reducing its exposure to high energy costs with a =20
comprehensive demand side response program. While the details of the progra=
m =20
remain to be developed, the company commitment includes an effort to=20
=01&maximize  the cost-effective reduction of peak load=018 through interva=
l and=20
time-of-use  metering, appliance control technologies and open architecture=
.=20
Its goals are to  include participation by all customer classes and=20
competitive suppliers and to  be available by next summer. If no program=20
agreement is reached, all parties may  address the issues in a future=20
Commission proceeding.=20

The other environmental benefits are real, if not as  comprehensive as one=
=20
might have preferred. FirstEnergy will give $5 million in  company money to=
=20
the GPU Sustainable Development Funds within 60 days. This  contribution is=
=20
in addition to those already made by GPU, but replaces the .01  cents/kwh o=
f=20
GPU ratepayer money that might have been provided between 2005 and  2008 IF=
=20
the Commission did not change distribution rates by that time. =20

FirstEnergy, in consultation with PennFuture, will also  invest an addition=
al=20
$10 million in renewable energy. Like all provisions of the  settlement, th=
e=20
environmental provisions are subject to PUC oversight. =20

What the Settlement Does Not Do
First,  the settlement does not really resolve what would happen in the eve=
nt=20
that the  merger falls through=01*if, for example, the New Jersey BPU rejec=
ts=20
the merger. All  of the agreements would be tossed except the agreement to=
=20
deal with the deferral  account for generation costs authorized by the=20
Commission on May 24. GPU would  write off all generation costs prior to Ju=
ne=20
1, 2001, while it would recover the  costs incurred after June 1, 2001 in a=
=20
manner and at a time to be determined in  Commission proceedings. Nothing i=
n=20
this provision assumes a rate increase or  breaking the rate caps. For=20
example, the costs could be recovered in a manner  comparable to the deferr=
al=20
accounting in the event that the merger is completed. =20

The settlement also does not allow FirstEnergy to raid any  pension funds.=
=20
Federal law and union contracts govern pension plan funding and  tolerate=
=20
some withdrawals with major tax penalties. GPU unions support the =20
settlement.=20

The settlement does not shut down or clean up all of  FirstEnergy=01,s foss=
il=20
generation plants, or figure out how to safely eliminate  FirstEnergy=01,s=
=20
nuclear waste.=20

Finally, the settlement does not establish lower  competitive wholesale and=
=20
retail market prices in the FirstEnergy and GPU  territories or jump start=
=20
the competitive market.=20

Yeah, that would have been nice, too. =20

***FERC launches formal hearing in El Paso case
     A collection of high-powered attorneys crowded a FERC hearing 
room yesterday for the launch of a formal hearing into 
allegations of market power abuse by El Paso and its affiliates. 
While a decision is still a way off, the presiding judge in the case 
made it clear that FERC must find a precise way to measure market 
share in California before ruling on the case.
     The hearing also marked the public release of a controversial 
market power study by The Brattle Group, which was commissioned 
by Southern California Edison to find evidence of market power 
abuse by El Paso marketing affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. The 
Brattle Group said that it found substantial evidence that El Paso 
manipulated California's gas market -- a claim that remains 
strongly in dispute (see story, page 4).
     In an opening statement, FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge 
Curtis Wagner laid down the parameters for the hearing. The 
burden of proof, he said, is on the California Public Utilities 
Commission, which filed the original Section 5 complaint against 
El Paso. But once a case is made, Wagner added, ""the burden of 
going forward with evidence to rebut that case shifts to El Paso 
Merchant and the parties on its side of the table.""
     The case originated last year, when the CPUC asked FERC to 
abrogate a series of transportation contracts between El Paso 
Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant. The California regulators 
claimed the capacity award was rigged, and further complained of 
a conspiracy to drive up the delivered price of gas into California.
     In March, FERC dismissed the CPUC's claim that there was 
favoritism in the bidding process for El Paso pipeline capacity (GD 
3/29). But the commission also sent the case before an ALJ, saying 
the case raised larger questions of market power. According to 
FERC, certain disputed issues of fact need to be examined at a 
hearing before a decision can be rendered.
     One of the biggest issues will be determining whether the 
affected market is the entire state of California or whether it is 
just Southern California. The CPUC and Southern California Edison 
maintain that only the Southern California market is at issue, 
while El Paso argues that the case applies to the entire state.
     The outcome of the case could hinge on that distinction. As 
Wagner noted in his opening remarks, ""The question of the 
geographic market makes a tremendous difference in how El Paso 
Merchant's market share will be measured and the results.""
     If the entire state is considered as a single market, said 
Wagner, then El Paso Merchant would have a market share that, 
depending on methodology, would range between 17% and 26.8%. 
But if the CPUC's contention that the market is Southern 
California holds up, he added, then El Paso Merchant's market 
share would be between 35% and 44.9%.
     Finding out whether market power exists also depends on how 
many players are involved in a particular market. Wagner said 
that the parties need to reach a stipulation among counsel on the 
number of players. In addition, he said that he would need a better 
geographic description of El Paso Merchant's capacity holdings 
and information on the price differential of gas between Northern 
and Southern California. 
     Finally, Wagner directed a number of questions to El Paso. El 
Paso Merchant, he said, ""should answer the CPUC's question as to 
why it subscribed for the involved [1.2 billion cfd] for 15 months 
when it had no market for that amount."" In addition, said Wagner, 
El Paso should ""show whether it sold in the secondary market 
short-term releases of the excess [capacity] at a price higher than 
it paid.""
     Wagner also heard arguments over the admissibility of certain 
evidence.
     Given the volume of testimony involved, the case will require 
some legal heavy lifting before a preliminary decision is reached. 
Noting that he received a nearly two-foot high stack of testimony 
last week, Wagner said that reading prehearing briefs and 
prepared testimony ""consumed a very beautiful Sunday in 
Washington."" (RP00-241)     NH

***El Paso takes aim at Calif. Assembly, study
     In an effort to clear its name in the ongoing California market 
power controversy, El Paso is going on the offensive. The company 
yesterday issued a riposte to claims -- publicized by California 
Assembly members and major newspapers -- that it manipulated 
California gas prices. And it took close aim at The Brattle Group, a 
consultancy that has figured prominently in various 
investigations into the matter. 
     According to El Paso, The Brattle Group worked ""hand-in-hand"" 
with a California Assembly subcommittee to pin the blame on El 
Paso and its subsidiaries for the run-up in gas prices in the 
Golden State. El Paso furnished copies of internal Assembly e-mails 
as proof that the subcommittee did not seek to conduct an 
objective investigation. 
     As reported in Gas Daily, The Brattle Group's study of alleged 
market power abuse by El Paso marketing arm El Paso Merchant 
Energy has been exhibit A in California pipeline litigation (GD 
4/25). In a study commissioned by Southern California Edison, The 
Brattle Group concluded that El Paso had deliberately manipulated 
California-bound pipeline capacity in an effort to drive up the 
price differential between production basins and the California 
border.
     Drawing in large part on The Brattle Group's opinion, the 
California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight recently 
concluded that El Paso caused the price run-up (GD 4/20). 
Representatives of the Assembly's Democratic majority said The 
Brattle Group study proved conclusively that the rise in gas 
prices at the California border was greater than could be 
accounted for through normal market forces.
     But according to El Paso, the subcommittee majority was -- 
deliberately -- wrong. The inquiry conducted by the subcommittee, 
said El Paso, was a ""charade that was orchestrated from the 
beginning"" to shore up SoCalEd's case.
     ""El Paso has recently obtained, through discovery in a 
proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
correspondence between the staff for the subcommittee and the 
paid litigation consultant [The Brattle Group] for Southern 
California Edison,"" said El Paso in a statement. ""This 
communication reveals that the subcommittee majority's 
conclusions were pre-determined to blame El Paso for California's 
failed energy policies.""
     The correspondence included apparent requests from 
subcommittee staff members for help in ""rebutting"" El Paso's 
testimony before the Assembly. El Paso interpreted those requests 
as proof that the subcommittee majority ""never intended"" to write 
an objective report on the matter. 
     ""We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its 
responsibilities to [SoCalEd's] consultants,"" said Norma Dunn, El 
Paso senior vice president of communications and government 
affairs. ""We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified 
before the subcommittee in good faith, under the false premise 
that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth. Now we 
learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of 
[SoCalEd's] litigation consultants to support SCE's litigation 
position."" 
     Litigation pitting SoCalEd and the California Public Utilities 
Commission against El Paso is currently under way at FERC (see 
story, page 1). Following yesterday's hearing, Dunn told Gas Daily 
that SoCalEd and the CPUC were also waging their campaign against 
El Paso in the   national press. 
     The New York Times, for instance, has published articles that 
relied on The Brattle Group study and other sealed documents. 
Dunn said it was ""clear"" that SoCalEd and the CPUC were using the 
selective leak of documents to take the case against El Paso to the 
public. 
     Prior to recess in yesterday's hearing, FERC Chief 
Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner issued a reminder of the 
need to restrict access to protected documents.     NH

El Paso Calls California Subcommittee Hearing a 'Sham' 
El Paso Corp. claims it was set up by California Assembly members to take the 
blame for high gas prices in the state. It said recent hearings before a 
subcommittee were a ""sham,"" and that it was ""predetermined"" that El Paso 
would be accused on wrongdoing in a report approved by the subcommittee 
majority yesterday. 
While El Paso battled similar accusations at the opening of hearings 
yesterday before a FERC administrative law judge, the company publicly 
contested the results of the majority report (approved 3-2) of the California 
Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight, which placed the blame on the 
energy company for skyrocketing gas prices in the state. The majority report 
says El Paso drove up gas prices by withholding pipeline capacity from the 
market, focusing on the same year-old capacity contract between El Paso's 
pipeline and marketing affiliate that is the subject of FERC's investigation. 
Contrary to the majority report, however, are the conclusions of a report 
prepared for the two Republican members of the five-member subcommittee. That 
document said the hearings ""produced no conclusive evidence"" of price 
manipulation. 
Although the majority report has not been made public, ""it is clear, based on 
accounts of the report and recently uncovered documents, that the 
subcommittee hearing was a sham,"" El Paso said in a statement. 
El Paso released to the public yesterday documents containing e-mail 
correspondence between staff members of the subcommittee and members of the 
Brattle Group, a paid consulting firm for Southern California Edison. The 
Brattle Group is one of El Paso's main opponents at the hearings this week 
before FERC's Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. Brattle 
accuses the company of costing Californians an additional $3.7 billion in gas 
costs over the past year. 
The correspondence El Paso released reveals a close relationship between the 
consulting firm and the subcommittee staff. For example, a staff member said 
to Brattle Group's Matthew O'Loughlin, ""I can't thank you and Paul enough for 
your testimony. It was beyond expectations, the members were highly 
impressed. The chairman asked me if you guys could stay and help us with a 
second day. We could have used it."" 
El Paso said the communication reveals that the subcommittee majority's 
conclusions were ""pre-determined to blame El Paso for California's failed 
energy policies."" The subcommittee majority was working ""hand-in-hand with, 
and relying on, SCE's consultant, the Brattle Group, in their so-called 
analysis,"" El Paso said. ""In communications between the subcommittee staff 
and SCE's consultant, it is clear that SCE's consultant assisted in preparing 
questions for the hearing and that the subcommittee staff requested 
assistance from SCE's consultant in preparing the final report. 
""That the subcommittee majority never intended to conduct an objective 
investigation is clear... [R]ather than write an objective report based on 
the testimony, the staff went on to ask SCE's consultant for help in 
'rebutting' El Paso's testimony."" 
""We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SCE's 
consultants,"" said Norma Dunn, senior vice president of Communications and 
Government Affairs for El Paso. ""We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff 
and testified before the subcommittee in good faith, under the false premise 
that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth. Now we learn that 
the subcommittee was working at the direction of SCE's litigation consultants 
to support SCE's litigation position. We are particularly concerned that 
after coordinating the questions to be asked, the Brattle Group testified 
before the subcommittee as if it were an independent group. It is obvious 
that the subcommittee hearings were a charade that was orchestrated from the 
beginning. Final conclusions were drawn before we had an opportunity to 
testify and then the final report was leaked to the press instead of provided 
to us, so that we would not have an opportunity to react."" 
Dunn said El Paso is confident that once the facts are presented to FERC in 
hearings this week, it will be ""vindicated."" 
However, El Paso also faces an uphill battle in Washington. The FERC hearings 
pit El Paso and its subsidiaries against the California Public Utilities 
Commission and the state's two largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas 
& Electric and Southern California Edison. 
The regulators and the utilities also allege El Paso withheld capacity on its 
pipelines into the state, which in turn pushed prices up. If the charges are 
substantiated, FERC Judge Wagner could order the company to refund any money 
it earned due to price or supply manipulation. Such a ruling could have even 
broader implications because skyrocketing prices for natural gas, the single 
biggest source of fuel for power plants in California, obviously contributed 
to the financial calamity that brought Southern California Edison to its 
knees and sent Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. 
The details of the charges are well known at this point. Critics alleged that 
El Paso Merchant Energy Gas LP and El Paso Merchant Energy Co. received 
inside information on a discount transportation rate that enabled them to end 
up the big winners in an open season in February of last year. The open 
season involved 1.22 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso to the California 
border. 
But in an order on complaint, FERC found ""no merit in the allegations."" It 
cleared El Paso of charges that it rigged the bidding for capacity to favor 
its affiliates. Moreover, it said there was no evidence that El Paso violated 
its standards of conduct. However, the Commission did not dismiss the 
allegations that El Paso engaged in market and price manipulation. It set the 
market power issue for hearing in March before Judge Wagner and ordered him 
to provide an initial decision within 60 days (see Daily GPI, March 29). 
FERC staff also appears to be hot on El Paso's tracks. In testimony submitted 
last week before Judge Wagner, FERC staff's expert witness concluded that El 
Paso probably exercised market power in the Southern California gas market 
and drove up gas prices over the past year when pipeline capacity constraints 
existed. FERC Economist Dr. Jonathan D. Ogur concluded that under certain 
circumstances El Paso was able to wield market power in the Southern 
California gas market (see Daily GPI, May 14). 
The rise in California natural gas prices is not attributable to El Paso, the 
company said in its statement yesterday, but is attributable to the fact that 
demand for gas has far outstripped supply. Evidence presented at the 
California subcommittee hearings shows that El Paso has consistently utilized 
its pipeline capacity to ship natural gas to California and has never 
restricted supply. Constraints on gas infrastructure in the state have 
limited the supply of gas during a time in which demand has risen 
dramatically, the company said.

PUC Delays Decision on Power Rate Hike 


Energy: Panel will discuss a new plan today that would shift more of the 
burden to residences from business. 

By TIM REITERMAN and MARLA DICKERSON, Times Staff Writers 

SAN FRANCISCO--The state's utility regulators delayed a decision Monday on 
how to structure a $5-billion electricity rate increase until today, when 
they will take up a revised plan that is expected to shift a larger share 
onto residential customers.
Assailed by power users and pressured by the governor, the California Public 
Utilities Commission said more time was needed to assess the impact on 
competing interest groups.

""The problem here is making sure we are allocating [the increase] equitably,"" 
PUC President Loretta Lynch said after the meeting. That, she said, is 
""tricky.""

About half the residential customers of the state's two largest utilities 
would see increases under Lynch's plan proposed last week. 
Bills for Southern California Edison customers who use moderate to heavy 
amounts of power would rise about 9% to 60%. Similar customers of Pacific Gas 
& Electric Co. would experience increases of about 7% to 40%.

To encourage conservation, Lynch said, she favors moving more of the overall 
burden of the increases to residential customers who are moderate users of 
electricity. Other commissioners say they believe that such a shift is 
necessary to protect the state's business climate.

Consumer advocates voiced concern that the PUC may be yielding to pressure 
from industry groups that enjoy relatively low rates but say they are being 
hit unfairly with much larger percentage increases than residential customers.

""The fear is the commission is caving in and taking [the increase] off big 
[business] customers and putting it on residential users above 130% of 
baseline,"" said Mike Florio, senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network.

The baseline amount on a bill is the minimum of electricity deemed necessary 
for a customer and varies by region. Under state legislation, there is no 
rate increase for consumption up to 130% of baseline. Also exempted are 
low-income customers who already receive discounted electricity rates.

The commission passed an increase of 3 cents a kilowatt hour March 27. In 
recent weeks, the panel has been conducting hearings on how to divvy up the 
increase among 9 million customers of Edison and PG&E. Monday's meeting was 
supposed to climax that process, paving the way for utilities to start 
billing customers June 1.

Dozens of speakers addressed the commission, and boisterous protesters in 
white coveralls repeatedly criticized the rate increase, chanting: ""I ain't 
payin' no hike, while they're getting rich from our power rates! Who you 
gonna call? Rate Busters!"" 

One had to be dragged away from the microphone.

To stunned surprise, Lynch later announced that the commission would not vote 
on her rate design proposed last week or a similar one proposed by a PUC 
administrative law judge.

Lynch revised the plan over the weekend and some commissioners said they had 
not yet seen the changes.

The delay means two commissioners will be out of town when the five-member 
panel designs the state's largest rate increase ever. Commissioner Richard 
Bilas is undergoing a medical procedure in Mendocino County. Commissioner 
Henry Duque is traveling to Texas as a director of the National Assn. of 
Utilities Commissioners. They said the law permits them to vote by phone as 
long as they do it from a publicly accessible place.

Lynch's proposal called for average rate increases of about 20% to 50% for 
various classes of customers. But officials said the proposal was being 
reviewed after testimony late last week and mounting concerns among some 
commissioners that it would hit industry and big commercial customers too 
hard, potentially hurting the state's economy.

After his financial advisors reviewed the PUC's proposals, Gov. Gray Davis 
put out a statement over the weekend saying his own proposal, including a 
slightly smaller rate hike, was better.

""My plan raises sufficient revenues to deal with the problem without putting 
an undue burden on California consumers and businesses that might hurt our 
economy,"" he said.

The governor's office last week asked the PUC to ""come around,"" said press 
secretary Steve Maviglio. ""There are gaps between his proposal and the PUC's.""

Carl Wood, one of three Davis appointees on the commission, said that he was 
generally comfortable with the Lynch proposal but that ""this is a big 
decision, and it is not ready"" for a vote.

Jeff Brown, another Davis appointee, said he spoke to the governor's office 
recently and learned that Davis had two primary concerns about the proposal: 
""No. 1 that there be sufficient price signals within the residential class 
[to make people conserve], and that the industrials not be walloped and have 
some mitigation of the rate increase.""

Brown said he would like to see industrial users paying less than the 50% 
hike in Lynch's proposal. He said that would mean residents who consume 300% 
of their baseline amount would have their rates rise 28% instead of about 15%.

""I want [the proposed amount for industrial customers] to go down somewhat 
but can't put all the burden on residentials,"" he said. 

""There are no good answers.""

Duque and Bilas, appointees of former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, expressed 
concerns that the rate proposal would further damage the economy.

""Industry is not getting a fair shake,"" Bilas said. ""If you want to achieve 
maximum conservation, you put [the increase] where demand is most elastic. It 
should be placed on you and me.""
Duque said: ""I think [industrial users] are getting an undue amount.""

Business groups have argued strongly that consumers must endure their fair 
share of the pain in order to encourage conservation.

Carl Guardino, president and chief executive of the Silicon Valley 
Manufacturing Group, said his group phoned Davis' staff to voice their 
opposition to the proposed rate structure.

""We found a receptive audience,"" he said. ""They saw that this [proposed rate 
structure] will deeply hinder our economy.""

1. The load figures for PGE are suspect in the MOU.
2. T&D is not split by class.    Total CPUC revenue was used and I subtracted 
the total gen portion ($'s) derived from the MOU.   This was apportioned pro

BODY:

???Ray Marquez wonders whether he'll have to cut back on food or gas in order
to pay his electricity bill.

??The 34-year-old Orange County maintenance man usually pays $80 a month for
power during summer months. Now, he's trying to figure out how to pay an
electricity bill that could push $130 come June 1.

??''Since I got married and had children, you know, I've been dealing with
balancing bills,'' he said Wednesday. ''But if I now have to pay more for
electricity, I'm not going to have money for gas or food for the kids.''

??As Californians coped with rolling blackouts that darkened thousands of
businesses and homes Monday and Tuesday, many struggled with an even bigger
worry: how to pay for soaring energy costs.

??In March, the state Public Utilities Commission approved the biggest rate
increase in California history, up to 46 percent for customers of Southern
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Those rate hikes start hitting
customers in next month's bill.

??Gailen Kyle, who raises alfalfa on 1,600 acres in the Mojave Desert, says a
40 percent increase would put his farm out of business.

??''It would end us,'' the third-generation farmer said. ''Everybody here that
farms alfalfa would be out of business.''

??Kyle, 46, said he has to pump water nearly around the clock from wells
drilled 310 feet below his farm near Lancaster. A small increase in the price 
of
energy a few months ago added $80,000 to the $400,000 annual bill he was 
already
paying.

??To save money, Kyle agreed to become an ''interruptible'' customer, meaning
he voluntarily allows his power to be shut off during statewide electricity
shortages in exchange for reduced rates. So far this year, his power has been
cut 26 times.

??Even before the state utilities commission raised rates, residents were
paying 26 percent more for electricity than the nationwide average, according 
to
federal statistics. Only customers in New England, New York, Alaska and Hawaii
pay more.

??One of the problems is that the wholesale cost of electricity has risen
sharply over the past year but under California's 1996 deregulation law the
state's largest utilities, PG&E and SoCal Edison, have been prevented from
passing their costs to customers. In April, PG&E declared bankruptcy.

??The West isn't just facing spiraling costs and a shortage of supplies,
however. Its transmission system is fragmented and overworked and would take
years to improve, power officials told the region's governors Wednesday.

??''There is no immediate solution,'' said Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, one of
four governors participating in a six-hour, round-table meeting with industry
representatives.

??The Western Governors Association was told there is no established method 
for
paying for transmission upgrades, and market and regulatory barriers stand in
the way. It's not even clear where new power lines are most needed.

??The group, which included the governors of Utah, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming,
has given energy experts until July 15 to recommend ways to eliminate
bottlenecks.

??Meanwhile Californians, who've already weathered six days of rolling
blackouts this year, fear they'll soon be paying more for less service.

??The Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid, has
forecast more than 30 days of blackouts this summer due to severe shortages of
electric supply.

??Dee Ann Hendirx, 53, of San Francisco, has stocked up on candles and
battery-operated clocks.

??''I hate to say this but it's getting to be a way of life in California,''
she said.

HEADLINE: ?California Blackout Season Begins

BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN


DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

BODY:

???California's newest season blackout season is here, and it arrived earlier
than expected.

??State officials had anticipated a crunch in June, when air conditioners are
cranked up for summer weather. But already, California has been hit with
back-to-back blackouts on Monday and Tuesday, and the operators of the state's
power grid barely scraped together enough energy to avoid blackouts Wednesday.

??''We're definitely in blackout season,'' said Michael Shames, executive
director of the Utility Consumer Action Network. ''Right now, there's almost a
disbelieving frustration that is going to elevate quickly to downright 
irritable
if we go through a summer of this.''

??Grid officials expected fewer problems Thursday, when temperatures were
expected to cool slightly and a large power plant was to return to service.

??Hot weather, a high number of power plants down for maintenance and little
power available from other states led to rolling blackouts this week that
affected hundreds of thousands of customers.

??Experts expect a long, hot summer of similar drills calls for conservation,
followed by blackouts. California has had six days of rolling blackouts so far
this year, and state regulators are forecasting at least 30 more this summer.

??For consumers, the early start of the season has created a mixture of
resignation and exasperation.

??''The first day we have a hot day we have an energy crisis,'' said San
Francisco resident Dee Ann Hendrix. ''I hate to say this, but it's getting to 
be
a way of life in California.''

??Fe Burian, 46, who moved to San Francisco from the Philippines, said the
blackouts had not affected her yet, ''but I come from a Third World country 
so I
know how it is.''

??It has been a year since consumers in San Diego got the first dose of
shortages and higher costs. Since then, Gov. Gray Davis and other leaders have
tried to deal with the crisis with mixed results.

??The state has spent $4.7 billion since January to buy power for its two
largest cash-strapped utilities. On Wednesday, the Legislature approved the 
sale
of $13.4 billion in revenue bonds to buy electricity. 

??Last month, the state Public Utilities Commission approved the biggest rate
increase in California history: up to 46 percent for customers of Southern
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. 

??Under a plan proposed Wednesday by PUC President Loretta Lynch, the increase
would be structured so that residential customers who use the most 
electricity 
would face average rate hikes of 35 percent 40 percent, while industrial users
could face increases of 50 percent or more.

??In February, Davis streamlined the permit process for new power plants and
created an ambitious conservation program to head off summer blackouts.

??But the governor's plan to have 5,000 megawatts of new power online by
midsummer is unrealistic, said Michael Zenker, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, an energy consulting firm.

??''There's no basis in fact in that number. We expect between 750 to 1,000 
new
megawatts,'' he said. A megawatt is roughly enough power for 750 homes.

??Zenker's organization predicted several months ago that the state would see
200 days of severe shortages this summer and 20 days of blackouts. But since
then, the forecast has gotten bleaker because drought in the Northwest is
expected to reduce output from hydroelectric plants.

??''Any sort of warm weather will be enough to push us into blackouts,'' 
Zenker
said.

??As for conservation, it will make blackouts shorter and less severe, Shames
said, ''but it won't stop the blackouts from happening.''

??Meanwhile, a judge said Wednesday that PG&E can continue paying its natural
gas suppliers, even as other creditors wait to recoup billions of dollars from
the utility.

??The decision allows PG&E, which last month filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, to buy gas that it sells to homes and

??usinesses.

HEADLINE: Davis asks generators to 'share pain'

BYLINE: Ed Mendel

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Gov. Gray Davis met yesterday with power generators he has accused of
price-gouging and asked them to ''share in the pain'' of California's 
electricity crisis by settling for 70 percent of what they are owed by
utilities.

??The governor said he told the generators that a key part of his rescue plan
for utilities, the purchase of the Southern California Edison transmission
system by the state, might not be approved by legislators if payments to
generators are not reduced.

??Davis said he warned the generators that if Edison is forced to join Pacific
Gas and Electric in bankruptcy, the generators would probably not be paid for
three or four years and might receive even less than 70 percent of what they 
are
owed as the judge distributes payments to creditors.

??''They could just do the math,'' said Davis, ''and see the value of having a
certain amount of money this year can be higher in many cases than what you 
can
expect to get out of the bankruptcy.''

??Davis said he told the generators to be prepared to negotiate with
legislators in the next few days. He said he believes that generators 
understand
that they must reduce the amount of their current claims.

??''I think they understand they have to share in the pain,'' Davis said.
''They have to share in the solution.''

??Davis said that of the $3.5 billion that Edison owes, about $1.1 billion to
$1.2 billion is owed to generators. He said he did not have similar figures 
for
PG&E. One of the generator executives who attended the nearly four-hour 
meeting
in the governor's office did not immediately dismiss the suggestion that
generators be paid less than they are owed.

??''I wouldn't say it's completely off the table,'' said Randy Harrison, chief
executive officer of Mirant. ''I think anything that's part of a long-term
comprehensive solution might be something we could discuss at some point.''

??But another generator executive who attended the meeting disagreed with the
governor's assessment that generators at the meeting understood that they must
reduce the amount of their claims.

??''At this point we feel like we played by the rules,'' said John Stout,
Reliant senior vice president.

??It was revealed last week that Duke Energy offered a plan to provide the
state more power and to settle for less than what it was owed if all lawsuits
and investigations into price-gouging were dropped. Davis rejected the offer.

??''We are not dropping any lawsuits,'' Davis said he told generators. ''We 
are
not dropping any investigations. Quite the contrary, we are pursuing all those
to the hilt.''

??Legislators have proposed seizing the power plants of generators and 
imposing
criminal penalties for price-gouging. The Senate approved a bill this week 
that
could impose a 100 percent tax on any generator revenue of more than $80 per
megawatt hours. The state estimates that it will pay an average of $346 per
megawatt hour for power purchased on the spot market during the second quarter
of this year.

??Davis suggested a windfall-profit tax goes against his instincts, but he has
not ruled it out.

??''It would cause blackouts,'' warned Reliant's Stout.

??The meeting in the governor's office yesterday was attended by the chief
executive officers of Mirant, Enron, Edison Mission Energy, Calpine and
Williams.

??Also attending were executives from Reliant, PG&E's National Energy Group,
Duke, AES and El Paso Natural Gas. Executives from Sempra and Dynegy
participated by telephone.

??Davis said the main topic was a discussion of ways to help California meet
its energy needs this summer. He said there was an agreement to publicize the
results of power-plant inspections in response to accusations that plants are
being taken off line to drive up electricity prices.

??Stout said there was a suggestion that the state sell electricity to the
Northwest during off-peak hours to reduce the drain on hydroelectric 
facilities
there and produce revenue for California. 

??Davis said some of the suggestions from generators were ''blue-sky'' ideas.
''I have no idea if they have merit,'' he said.

??Earlier in the day, the state Senate sent Davis a bill authorizing $13.4
billion in bonds to repay the state general fund for power purchases, which
total more than $6 billion so far.

??But because Republicans refused to provide the votes needed to allow the 
bill
to take effect immediately, a special session on energy will be ended
prematurely Monday to allow the bond measure to take effect 90 days later in
August.

??Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton, D-San Francisco, said that a new
special session will be called and steps will be taken to return dozens of
stranded bills to their positions in the legislative process, avoiding the 
need
to repeat hearings and votes.

??The state began buying power for utility customers in January after PG&E and
Edison, whose rates were frozen by deregulation as wholesale power costs 
soared,
ran up a $13 billion debt and could no longer borrow.

??Davis urged Republicans to reconsider their vote and approve a bond sale
before the new fiscal year begins July 1. If the state general fund is not
repaid, he said that funding may have to be reduced for ''transportation,
hospitals, schools, the environment, law enforcement and other important''
programs.

??Assembly Republicans, who wanted to reduce the size of the bonds by not
repaying the general fund for $6.5 billion worth of power, said yesterday that
the new state budget should include a $4 billion reserve for power purchases.

??The Assembly GOP point man on the budget, George Runner of Lancaster, said 
he
fears that the situation is deteriorating and that California may have to
consider rationing the amount of electricity. 

??''I believe we are coming very closely to this line that we are no longer
dealing with conservation issues we are dealing with rationing,'' Runner said.

??In other action yesterday:

???Legislation that would allow San Diego County to form its own municipal
utility district cleared a key hurdle after the bill's author, Assemblyman 
Mark
Wyland, R-Escondido, agreed to require voter approval for any new district.

??The bill, which has bipartisan support from the San Diego delegation, would
require majority approval before a district could be formed. Current law
requires a two-thirds vote.

???Loretta Lynch, chairwoman of the California Public Utilities, said she 
hopes
to spare 50 percent of residential power users from any increases under the
pending rate hikes for PG&E and Edison.

??The hikes, which amount to about 3 cents per kilowatt hour and raise about 
$5
billion annually to cover power costs, will be formally approved Monday by the
commission. Lynch's proposal, which she released yesterday, is one of several
for allocating the increase and calls for heavier electricity users to pay 
more
than moderate users.

??SDG&E's request for a rate hike will be considered later.

HEADLINE: Bush Energy Stance Begins to Worry Some in GOP

BYLINE: GREG MILLER, RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

??As power shortages and price spikes spread beyond California, congressional
Republicans are beginning to worry that the Bush administration's reluctance 
to
offer much immediate relief could hurt the party in the 2002 elections.

??A national energy plan to be unveiled by the White House next week will 
focus
on long-term strategies. But with California and other states bracing for a
summer of electricity turmoil and gasoline prices surging across the country,
some GOP lawmakers are pressing for short-term solutions.

??""The White House has been taking a look at the big picture,"" said a GOP
leadership aide in the House. ""But they're going to be around in four years. 
We
might not have members around in two years if we don't show we care.""

??That sentiment is being voiced by a rising number of GOP lawmakers. ""We're 
in
a crisis situation, which is only going to get worse if we don't act very
aggressively,"" Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said Wednesday. Gallegly is
one of four congressional Republicans from California to break with the
administration by supporting temporary price controls on wholesale 
electricity.

??The rising anxiety, which has begun spreading beyond the California 
delegation, underscores how much has changed since the state declared its 
first
Stage 3 power emergency in December. At that time, Congress' response was
largely: That's Gov. Gray Davis' problem.

??Not anymore.

??Thirty-nine Stage 3 alerts later, a House committee today will take up a
GOP-drafted emergency bill that would, among other things, allow Davis to
temporarily waive certain emission standards for power plants during an
emergency and provide federal aid to relieve a notorious bottleneck in the
California power grid.

??But some GOP lawmakers say the legislation doesn't go far enough, and plan 
to
offer amendments containing their own ideas. Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs)
plans to push for $100 million in energy assistance to low-income households 
and
for a directive to federal facilities in the West to cut energy use by 20%.

??""House leaders recognize that they could lose the House in California if
there's not an action plan that members can campaign on,"" said Scott Reed, a 
GOP
strategist.

??As lawmakers search for ways to provide immediate relief, the White House
continues to cite California's troubles as evidence of the need to upgrade an
aging, overburdened electricity transmission system.

??Responding to reports that the administration would propose legislation to
give the federal government eminent domain authority in siting power lines,
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush wants to ensure that the
distribution infrastructure can move electricity from regions with surpluses 
to
regions that need more power.

??""That's one of the reasons that California is going through the difficulties
it's going through,"" Fleischer said. ""There is energy available in other parts
of the country, but it can't be shipped to California as easily as you would
hope, because of infrastructure problems.""

??Fleischer took exception to a front-page story in The Times reporting that
Bush, in a speech delivered Tuesday, ""offered no hint of what his 
administration
might do"" to help California avert a possible economic downturn caused by 
power
blackouts.

??Though the president did not specifically mention possible actions in the
speech, Fleischer said Bush last week ""announced a series of steps, including
conservation,"" to help California get through an energy crisis this summer.

??He said that the Pentagon is reducing its energy needs within California by
10% and that all other federal agencies, at Bush's direction, are reviewing
their energy consumption patterns.

??Environmentalists already have begun blasting the administration's energy
plan--even before its details are made public--for what they characterize as a
failure to emphasize energy efficiency and investments in renewable fuels.

??Activists Say Crisis Isn't Real

??At a Wednesday news briefing, a coalition of environmental advocates
disagreed with the administration's assertion that the country is experiencing
an energy ""crisis,"" and accused it of crafting a plan designed to boost the
profits of key campaign contributors.

??""We cannot drill our way out of this situation,"" said Dan Becker of the
Sierra Club. He and others argued that conserving fuel--with cars that use 
less
gasoline and appliances that use less electricity, for example--is the best 
way
to avoid energy shortages in the short term.

??So far, it is not clear whether the energy crisis will work to either 
party's
advantage. Many on Capitol Hill are bracing for an election year that could be
brutal for incumbents of both parties if voters who endure high energy bills
this summer vent their frustration in the voting booth next year.

??Some House Republicans acknowledged that they have been pushing the White
House to appear more engaged in finding near-term solutions.

??When House Republicans met with Cheney last week, ""they urged him and all 
the
administration to at least make it clear that a lot of effort is going into
finding a way to solve the problem,"" said Jim Specht, a spokesman for Rep. 
Jerry
Lewis (R-Redlands), leader of the California GOP delegation.

??Though some Republicans have offered ideas to address the immediate problem,
it is not clear whether any will receive congressional approval.

??Indeed, the emergency assistance bill being taken up today by the House
energy subcommittee faces trouble, although it was drafted by the panel's
chairman, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas).

??Barton stripped out a number of provisions opposed by environmentalists. But
Democrats plan to seek a vote on capping wholesale electricity prices, a
proposal most Republicans oppose. Democrats also plan to introduce an 
amendment
to target natural gas prices.

??House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) said the bill ""fails
miserably"" to address California's problems. ""During the campaign, President
Bush promised a sensible energy policy,"" Gephardt said. ""In recent weeks,
however, the president has responded to the gathering crisis by throwing up 
his
hands and saying there's nothing we can do, there's no way to give people
immediate relief from blackouts and sky-high increases of price of gasoline at
the pump.""

??Lawmakers of both parties acknowledge that they are hearing a rising chorus
of constituent complaints about the energy price spikes and supply shortages.

??Rep. Chris Cox (R-Newport Beach) was caught in a blackout during a tour of a
computer chip factory in his district. ""They said it cost them $1 million if 
the
power goes off even for five minutes,"" said Cox, who nonetheless opposes price
controls.

??Cox said he is worried about how the California electricity crisis might
affect the national economy. He said that when he asks business owners about
expanding in California, ""they just look at you like you're nuts. They don't
consider California an option because of this uncertainty.""

??""People come up to you and want you to help solve the problem,"" said Rep.
George Radanovich (R-Mariposa).

??He has explained that there is little the federal government can do in the
short term.

??""Californians want somebody to do something,"" said John J. Pitney Jr.,
associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. ""When people 
are
in a mood like that, politicians get nervous thinking that they're the ones 
who
might get blamed.""

??Said Reed, the GOP strategist: ""Every incumbent in California is vulnerable
in the next election, in both parties. This is an issue that is not 
ideological.
It's about action and solving a short-term problem. ""Politics have taken over
this issue, like it or not,"" he said. ""They may have been raging in California
for the last three or four months. It's now a national political issue.""

HEADLINE: Rate Hikes Up to 60% Proposed by PUC Chief;
Power: Lynch says about half the residential customers of Edison, PG&E would
escape increases. Her plan draws fire from all sides.

BYLINE: TIM REITERMAN, NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

??About 4 million California residential electricity customers will face
increases in their monthly bills of up to about 60% under a proposal unveiled
Wednesday by the state's chief utility regulator. Interest groups on all sides
promptly condemned the plan as too hard on either consumers or businesses.

??The proposal by California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta
Lynch would increase the bills of roughly half of Southern California Edison's
residential customers, who consume medium to heavy amounts, by $8 to $93 a
month. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers would be hit with hikes of $6 to 
$87
a month.

??About half of the residential customers of the state's two biggest public
utilities would see no increase under the proposal if they continued to 
consume
energy at their current pace.

??Lynch said she could not guarantee that more rate increases would not be
necessary. ""Even these astronomical average rates may prove inadequate,"" she
said, noting that wholesale electricity prices are still high and 
unpredictable.
??The rate hike, Lynch said at a news conference, is necessary because 
""federal
regulators have failed to follow federal laws to ensure just and reasonable
prices.""

??The deepening energy crisis compelled Lynch to release her proposal after
public hearings on the rate increase already had begun. Lynch said that she
wished her proposal had been ready sooner, but that at least some of the
remaining public hearings will have the benefit of reviewing it.

??PUC passage of the essential elements of Lynch's plan seems likely.

??Along with two of her colleagues on the five-member commission, Lynch was
appointed by Gov. Gray Davis, and they often vote as a bloc. Lynch said,
however, that testimony later this week from utilities, the public and other
interested parties could prompt modifications.

??Structuring the $5-billion rate increase is an important but politically
sensitive step in California's attempt to restore stability to the delivery of
power to 9 million customers of two financially troubled utilities while
protecting the state budget.

??The PUC has tried to design rates that would encourage conservation without
damaging business. Competing interest groups, ranging from consumer advocates 
to
large manufacturers, have been jockeying for advantage for weeks.

??The PUC approved a rate increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour March 27 to
help pay the state's mounting power tab, which now exceeds $5 billion. This
week, the commission is conducting statewide hearings on how the pain should 
be
shared among millions of residents and businesses. On Monday the panel is set 
to
vote on Lynch's plan and a similar one by a PUC administrative law judge.

??Neither proposal appeared to please anyone.

??""The PUC says everyone should share the pain, but we think the fair share of
the pain for residential consumers should be zero,"" said Mindy Spatt,
spokeswoman for the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer group. 
""It
should be paid by commercial and industrial customers who wanted and still 
want
deregulation.""

??Consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield said regulators should go after power
generators and their hefty profits rather than ratepayers.

??""Rate increases are not the answer, and this is not going to be the end of
them,"" said Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights in Santa Monica. ""This is like organized crime: The more you give them,
the more they want.""

??Commercial and industrial customers would see increases of up to 50%, and
agricultural interests would face increases of 23% to 30% under Lynch's
proposal.

??Business interests contend that the rate hikes hit them much harder than
residential users.

??Calling the proposal ""a death knell for the California economy,"" Jack M.
Stewart of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn. estimated that
industrial customers would see their power rates increase an average of 53%. 
And
the pain of the rate hikes will be compounded by blackouts this summer, which
the group contends will cost California businesses $21.8 billion in lost
productivity.

??""For most large manufacturers, energy is a large piece of their operating
costs,"" Stewart said. ""If you add 53% to that, it's going to severely hamper
their ability to do business.""

??Unlike residential customers, the business customers are not grouped into
tiers based on their amount of usage. Lynch said there was insufficient time 
to
establish a tiering system for nonresidential customers by June 1, when the 
rate
hikes will start showing up on bills.

??An earlier proposal by Lynch had attempted to narrow the gap between
residential rates and the lower rates paid by nonresidential customers. But 
the
commission president said that goal could not be immediately achieved without
seriously damaging the state's economy.

??To protect the largest users from gigantic rate increases, Lynch's proposal
caps the maximum bill increase at 300% for most customers and 250% for
agricultural customers.

??""While we understand bill limiters may have some troubling conservation
impacts, at some point, price signals are unbearable for customers. Bill
limiters will protect customers from unanticipated extraordinary bill 
impacts,""
Lynch wrote.

??In recent weeks, the commission has received about 20 plans for structuring
the rate increase, including one from Davis, who had proposed a slightly 
smaller
overall rate increase. Lynch said her plan incorporates a number of features 
of
the governor's plan, including a tiered structure that would punish heavy 
users
and reward those who conserve.

??Under state legislation, there is no rate increase for consumption up to 
130%
of baseline, the amount deemed the minimum needed by a customer in a given 
area
and noted on ratepayer bills. Also exempted are low-income customers who 
already
receive discounted electricity rates.

??Edison and PG&E said they could not assess how the PUC proposals would 
affect
their customers because the commission had not provided details to the 
utilities
as of late Wednesday.

??But PG&E has disputed the commission's claim that half of customers would 
not
be affected by the increase, noting that only 32% of PG&E customers never
exceeded 130% of baseline usage in the last year.

??Industrial and commercial customers complained that the plan should not
exempt such a large group of residential customers, in any event. A rate
increase for these users--based on the PUC's estimate that the group will
constitute about half of residential customers--could generate an extra $1
billion.

??If the PUC insists on exempting so many, the $1-billion shortfall should be
covered solely by other residential users, businesses say.

??Under Lynch's plan the burden of paying that amount would be split equally
among commercial, industrial and nonexempt residential customers.

??If covering the shortfall were not shared by the three groups, Lynch said,
some residential customers would suffer a 100% increase in their bills.

??The proposal calls for a pilot program, including one that would let federal
agencies based in California ""experiment with their own market rate policies.""

??Lynch challenged federal agencies to try to live with ""real time,"" or 
hourly,
prices in the volatile wholesale marketplace--a slap at officials of the 
Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission who favor a free wholesale market over price 
caps.
Use of real-time pricing requires installing a special meter.

??""'It would be great if the federal users respond to price signals enough 
that
prices come down,"" Lynch said, adding that she was skeptical that would happen
in today's dysfunctional market.

??A FERC spokeswoman declined to comment on Lynch's proposal.

??During the third day of PUC hearings, about 200 people gathered at Fullerton
College. Seventy people testified, most venting their anger at elected 
officials
and utility companies, whom they blame for the state's flawed deregulation 
plan.

??""I am opposed to any rate increase for residences and small business,""
testified Ruth Shapin, a Santa Ana attorney. ""This crisis was created by
politicians. PG&E and SCE have transferred billions of dollars to their parent
companies. Let them bail themselves out, not the ratepayers.""

??Others said the baselines might be unfair because the commission had not
taken into consideration home size, the number of occupants and the location.

??""It's going to be hard for many people to stay below the 130% baseline,"" 
said
Sylvia Hartman of Lakewood. ""Some customers could easily go 400% over the
baseline.""

??A proposal by California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch
charges the highest rates to residential customers who use the most 
electricity.
The standard for measuring use is a customer's baseline, which is considered

Governor Asks Generators to Take Less Than They're Owed;
Power: Meeting with firms, Davis says that settling for 70% of debt would help
Edison stay solvent. One executive bristles.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??After spending months bashing independent power generators, Gov. Gray Davis 
on Wednesday called on them to take 30% less than the $1.2 billion they are 
owed
by Southern California Edison.

??""The Legislature [is] going to insist on a reduction,"" Davis said after a
meeting in his office with representatives of a dozen power generating
companies. Davis said he told them that ""70% this year was more valuable to 
them
than whatever they get two or three years down the line"" if Edison is forced
into bankruptcy.

??Davis urged generators to help California extricate itself from a summer of
rolling blackouts by selling every available electron to the state.

??He held out the possibility that he might sign legislation imposing a
windfall profits tax on generators if they fail to help out this summer.

??""My attitude on that would depend a lot on whether they showed good faith 
and
cooperated throughout this process,"" Davis said, emerging after a four-hour,
closed-door meeting with the generators.

??The Democratic governor issued an invitation last week to the chief 
executive
officers of power generating and marketing companies including Enron, 
Reliant, 
Duke Energy and others to meet with him in Sacramento. But most of the
executives who attended were a few pay grades below CEO.

??Davis said he urged that the executives press lawmakers to approve the deal
he struck with Edison in which the state would give the ailing utility an
infusion of cash by buying its transmission system for $2.76 billion. Edison
would use the money to restructure its debt and pay its creditors.

??Davis said lawmakers will not approve the deal unless the independent power
generators take less than they are owed.

??He noted that the state and the power generators have ""a collective interest
in seeing that this summer has as few disruptions as possible."" If California 
is
hit with repeated blackouts, Davis has said, other states will delay or end
efforts to deregulate their electricity markets.

??Executives, who braved taunts from a few protesters wearing pig masks and
carrying a small but loudly squealing pig, characterized the meeting as
businesslike. But at least some generators are less than enthusiastic about
taking less than they are owed.

??""I have a real concern about the notion that we should give back some of the
money we made,"" said John Stout, a senior vice president of the Houston-based
Reliant Energy, which says it is owed $300 million by Southern California 
Edison
and Pacific Gas & Electric. 

??Stout said that much of the money Reliant made in California is being
reinvested in power plant construction--although he added that the company has
no generators under construction in California. 

??""Political uncertainty has put a huge risk factor on investment in
California,"" Stout said.

??Randy Harrison, an executive with Mirant, based in Atlanta, said the issue 
of
a so-called ""haircut"" was discussed, though not in detail. Harrison said it is
""not completely off the table."" But he added that his company is not
profiteering. Nor has it withheld electricity in any attempt to manipulate
wholesale energy prices.

??""Our people are working 24 hours a day and we are spending millions of
dollars to try and keep our power plants up and running,"" Harrison said.

??The meeting was aimed at opening communication with the generators. But 
Davis
aides said the governor also wanted to bring attention to companies that he
believes are at least partly responsible for California's energy crisis.

??The meeting occurred as polls show that voters are increasingly angry about
the energy crisis and as lawmakers, fearful that the energy crisis will wreck
California's economy, sharpen their attacks on power generators.

??Legislators have introduced bills to impose a windfall profits tax on
generators and make it a felony to manipulate electricity markets. Lt. Gov. 
Cruz
Bustamante and Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews (D-Tracy) sued several 
generators
last week. Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer is investigating whether generators 
violated
antitrust and other laws as wholesale prices soared to record heights, 
hobbling
Edison and helping push PG&E into bankruptcy.

??Voters are not sure who is to blame, but they are convinced that ""whoever is
taking our money is taking way too much,"" said Democratic political consultant
Richie Ross.

??""They want to find this deregulation's Charles Keating,"" Ross said, 
referring
to a central figure in the 1980s savings and loan debacle.

??Still, as much as Davis and others demonize generators, the state needs 
them,
some officials say.

??""We don't have enough power without them,"" said Assembly Energy Committee
Chairman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles). ""There needs to be an adult 
discussion
to see what can be worked out.""

Time to Give Some of the Power Players a Haircut

BYLINE: GEORGE SKELTON

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Gray and the Grid. Sounds like an old rock group. And it's slipping fast on
the Capitol charts.

??Same with MOU. That's not a rapper, but it's making about as much sense to
most legislators.

??MOU--Memo of Understanding--is the complex deal Gov. Gray Davis cut with
Southern California Edison last month to rescue the utility from bankruptcy. 
The
key provision is Davis' offer to buy Edison's high-voltage lines--its 
grid--for
$2.76 billion.

??Of that, $1.5 billion would go to Edison's creditors, the electricity
suppliers the utility has stiffed. Edison customers would kick in another $2
billion to pay off the total debt, estimated at $3.5 billion.

??The state would repair and expand the clogged grid--for less money than
Edison could--and collect transmission fees to pay for the lines. It also 
would
be in better position to possibly buy bankrupt PG&E's lines and ultimately 
place
the entire California grid under public ownership.

??Problem is, this deal must be approved by the Legislature. And the governor
can't even find a lawmaker willing to sponsor the bill.

??Politicians have looked at polls and seen that voters regard private
utilities as the No. 1 villain in this energy mugging. They're leery of
supporting anything that might smack of a public bailout for Edison.

??""It's seen as a gift,"" Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) says of
the MOU.

??The Davis deal seems DOA. So both legislative houses are drafting
alternatives.

??Most Democrats--who own Sacramento--think the creditors should ""take a
haircut."" That's Capitol jargon for discounting the debt.

??Burton figures that a 30% haircut will be necessary for any Edison deal.
That's justified, he and others say, because the creditors--mainly 
out-of-state
power companies--have been gouging the utilities anyway.

??On Wednesday, Davis agreed. He proposed a 30% haircut in a meeting with
stunned power generators, who had little response.

??There must be shared pain, Davis and Burton assert. Shared by creditors,
Edison's parent company, the utility itself and ratepayers. Under the MOU, 
only
ratepayers suffer pain.

??The liberal Senate leader was an early advocate of acquiring the grid. And 
he
still is. But he asserts this MOU isn't needed for that. Perhaps the grid can 
be
picked up as a separate ticket.

??Across the Capitol, freshman Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los
Angeles)--the former L.A. council member--has been meeting with a small group
that is looking for alternatives to the Davis deal.

??""It's uncertain whether we can pass the MOU in its current form,"" she says.
""But nobody wants to leave this hanging in limbo.""

??Among the options, she says, is acquiring the grid without paying for it.
Edison would just shift title. That way there'd be no legislative haggling 
over
price.

??But the state would take care of the utility's debts after creditor 
haircuts.
Good trims.

??""There's no definition of gouging that wouldn't be appropriate here,""
Goldberg says.

??""Maybe the governor could have moved faster. There are a lot of shouldas,
wouldas. But when I get angry, I get angry at FERC and the price gougers.""

??FERC and the Price Gougers--at the very bottom of the Capitol charts.

??Burton and Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) announced plans
Monday to sue the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They want to force 
FERC
to protect California consumers against the gougers. Obey the law and make 
sure
the power pirates charge only ""just and reasonable"" prices. Return unfair
profits. Set wholesale price caps.

??""This case is about old people in convalescent homes, which are not exempt
from blackouts,"" said the legislators' veteran trial attorney, Joseph 
Cotchett.
""We're talking about health and welfare. People on life support machines. This
is not about swimming pool heaters.""

??It's a longshot suit--two legislative leaders suing the federal government.
There's a doctrine about separation of powers. But the action illustrates
Sacramento's current frustration.

??On Wednesday, there was a new group: Gray and the Generators.

??The governor invited in the gougers for some frank talk in his office.
Earlier, he had accused them of ""just satisfying their greed and sucking money
out of the state.""

??They weren't in the mood for a Capitol haircut.

??But one power official confided that many do wish FERC would be more
aggressive--set hard rules, order refunds if justified and just handle it. The
state Capitol wouldn't be so overheated and there'd be less pressure on the
generators if the Feds did their job.

??In that regard, Californians now are beginning to discover another group:
Bush and the Blackouts.

??The boos are becoming more raucous.

HEADLINE: Davis Faces Budget Cuts, Report Says;
Finance: The state surplus shrinks by $3.4 billion as tech-firm troubles 
reduce
tax revenue. Meanwhile, spending on the energy crisis mounts.

BYLINE: JULIE TAMAKI MIGUEL BUSTILLO, CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??The suffering of California's high-tech firms is taking its toll on the
fortunes of state government, according to the nonpartisan legislative 
analyst,
who said Wednesday that the state budget surplus has shrunk by $3.4 billion.

??To keep the budget out of the red, Gov. Gray Davis will have to slash his
state spending plan, an unpleasant prospect for those who rely on state 
services
and a politically dicey task for a governor facing reelection next year. Among
the areas that could be hit are anticipated transportation projects and a
program to extend health insurance to poor people.

??Elizabeth Hill's grim update on the state's financial outlook complicates an
already difficult situation for state officials trying to pay for services 
amid
an extraordinarily expensive energy crisis. More than $6 billion has been
drained from California coffers to pay for energy purchases. Hill's assessment
of the state economy and its effect on the budget does not take that money 
into
account because it assumes that a bond issue, approved Wednesday, will repay 
the
state's general fund.

??Should that fall through, her budget estimates would grow more dire.

??Hill's office previously estimated an $8-billion state surplus over this 
year
and next. But California has been particularly hard-hit by the struggles of 
the
state's high-tech firms, which in recent years had fueled huge state tax
receipts as employees cashed out stock options, said Brad Williams, senior
economist for Hill's office.

??""This shouldn't be too terribly surprising given the negative developments 
in
the economy and the negative developments in the stock market,"" Williams said.
""The economic picture has changed significantly since January.""

??In a letter to lawmakers, Hill said onetime and ongoing spending cuts will 
be
needed to stave off a deficit that would occur if the governor's spending plan
were put in place. Under that plan, money would be spent faster than it would
come in, according to Hill's projections.

??At the rate of spending contemplated by the governor's current budget
proposal, the deficit would hit $1.5 billion in the 2001-02 budget year and 
rise
to $6 billion by 2002-03, Hill predicted. To avoid running into the red, Hill
floated the possibility of $2.5 billion in onetime cuts in the next budget and
an annual reduction of $1.7 billion through the 2002-03 fiscal year.

??Department of Finance spokesman Sandy Harrison said the Davis administration
would not comment on Hill's projection Wednesday, adding only that the 
governor
would account for updated revenue estimates Monday when he releases his 
revised
spending plan.

??But lawmakers are reacting with alarm and are vowing to cut whatever 
programs
are expendable to avoid what some consider the worst alternative: a tax
increase.

??""That's the last thing we want to do,"" said Assembly Budget Committee
Chairman Tony Cardenas (D-Sylmar). ""It has crossed our minds. We do not like 
the
fact that it has crossed our minds.""

??Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) said the nearly $
5-billion shortfall that Hill predicts for the 2001-02 fiscal year is
optimistic. He believes revenue actually could sink as much as $20 billion.

??Peace said Hill appears to be projecting that revenue will begin to rebound
toward the end of the year, but he predicted a continued decline as the 
economic
downturn manifesting itself on Wall Street trickles down to Main Street.

??""I think we are in for a huge problem and that assumes no impact from the
energy stuff,"" Peace said.

??Though legislators appear most determined to avoid a tax increase, cutting
services would represent a political challenge.

??Peace suggested that up to $2 billion could be saved by delaying certain
onetime transportation programs that have yet to get off the ground. He warned
that a proposed expansion of the Healthy Families program, which provides 
health
insurance to low-income Californians, could be in jeopardy.

??Education funding in the upcoming budget year probably will still rise over
the previous year, but fall short of the level contemplated by Davis in 
January
by about half a billion dollars, Peace predicted.

??Davis' $1.45-billion, three-year plan to extend the middle school year has
faced substantial opposition in the Legislature and may be rejected, which 
would
relieve the need to cut other programs.

??Without question, the biggest cloud hanging over the budget is whether the
general fund will be repaid for billions of dollars in energy purchases--a
possibility that is quickly dismissed in Hill's analysis.

??To avoid blackouts, California has been buying massive quantities of
electricity since January because the state's private utilities had become too
burdened with debt to continue making purchases on the expensive wholesale 
power
market.

??Davis had planned to reimburse the budget with proceeds from a record $
12.5-billion bond sale and that utility ratepayers would then pay off the 
bonds.
But the sale has been delayed until August at the earliest, leaving a gaping
hole in state coffers as lawmakers plan the budget.

??Cardenas said it is likely that legislators will be forced to craft a
two-tiered budget this year, one that assumes a bond sale is completed and one
that prepares for the possibility it is not.

??There are other uncertainties as well. Consumer activists say they are
considering challenging the bond issue with a ballot measure--a threat that
could further undermine confidence about the bond issue, and California's
financial health, on Wall Street. California's credit rating has already been
lowered by one credit rating agency because of concerns over repayment of the
state budget.

??If the bond issue does not go through, ""then we have to make cuts
everywhere,"" Cardenas said. ""Everything is up for grabs.""

BYLINE: ?AP

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, May 9

BODY:

??Gov. Gray Davis asked power generators today to accept a 30 percent cut in
money they are owed by Southern California Edison, the state's second largest
utility, to help keep it afloat.

??The California governor's request came after two days of rolling blackouts
caused by high temperatures and scarce electricity. Grid operators avoided
blackouts today after temperatures dropped slightly.

???Officials at the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's
electricity grid, said that supplies would still be tight on Thursday, but 
that
slightly cooler weather would help them meet demand.

??Southern California Edison owes generators more than $1.1 billion, but they
are unlikely to see their money for years if it declares bankruptcy, Mr. Davis
said he told 12 electricity and natural gas producers.

??""I think they understand they have to share in the pain,"" the governor said.
""They have to share in the solution. I believe they are willing to take some
reduction in the amount of money they are currently claiming.""

??So far no one is volunteering to forgive the debts.

??Southern California air regulators are close to slashing their market-based
system for controlling power plant pollution. The move is intended to allow
large power plants to operate at full capacity without facing stiff fines as
they try to meet demand.

??The change was promoted by an executive order from Governor Davis requiring
air districts to let large generators run at the greatest capacity.

HEADLINE: Power bills set to skyrocket for heavy users;

Graduated rate increase would take effect in June

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: David Lazarus

BODY:
As state regulators outlined plans to raise residential electricity bills by 
as
much as 40 percent, the head of the Public Utilities Commission warned 
yesterday
that power rates could soar even higher.

???The PUC, which adopted an increase in March, is scheduled to approve 
details
of the new rates in San Francisco on Monday. Consumers will see the higher 
rates
in their June utility bills.

???State regulators say nearly half of all consumers will see no change in
their power bills. The remainder will experience rate increases ranging from 3
percent to more than 50 percent, depending on the type of customer and the
amount of power used.

???The increases would be added to an average 10 percent increase adopted in
January.

???PUC President Loretta Lynch suggested that rates could rise yet again if
wholesale electricity prices continue to surge this summer.

???""If the sellers decide to turn up the heat and raise prices, we'll have to
look again at the numbers,"" she said.

???INCREASE WILL CONTRIBUTE LITTLE

???The proposed rate increase would bring in about $5 billion annually -- a
fraction of the estimated $65 billion California will spend this year 
purchasing
power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities.

???Lynch said she expects the remainder to be made up by issuing bonds. The
state Senate yesterday approved $13.4 billion in bonds to help cover
California's power costs.

???However, those bonds would not be released until August, by which time
California's energy tab would be billions of dollars higher.

???""There's huge cause for concern that this latest rate increase is a down
payment rather than anything close to a final installment,"" said Bob
Finkelstein, staff attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco.

???The PUC's Lynch stressed that while California's new rate structure would
place a greater burden on the state's heaviest power users, the increases are
intended to spread the pain among all consumers.

???""Energy is expensive for every hour of every day for every customer,"" she
said.

???LINING UP TO GET PAID

???That includes the state Department of Water Resources, which is spending
about $70 million a day to keep California's lights on.

???While the PUC is moving to have more money collected from consumers to pay
California's power bills, it has yet to address the thorny question of how the
proceeds will be distributed among the various parties lined up for
compensation.

???The Water Resources Department wants all rate-related revenues to first
replenish state coffers, while Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison Co. insist that they be paid as well for their own expenses.

???The utilities' costs include payments to small power generators that can no
longer afford natural gas to run their plants. The recent closure of hundreds 
of
such facilities is a key reason California is experiencing blackouts this 
week.

???Although PG&E said yesterday that most of the smaller generators with which
it does business are now back online, it is not yet clear whether the utility
will be able to keep paying for their power.

???""It appears that everything (from the rate increase) is going to DWR (the
Water Resources Department),"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman.

???Lynch said the PUC will take up the matter of apportioning funds at an
unspecified future date.

???CONSERVATIVE USE PAYS

???For the moment, state regulators have their hands full digesting two
competing -- and highly complex -- proposals for how rates should be increased
next week.

???One proposal was submitted by an administrative law judge working with the
PUC and the other by Lynch. Commissioners will choose between them on Monday.

???The two proposals are largely identical. Under both, residential customers
who can keep electricity usage within 130 percent of predetermined limits 
would
experience no rate increase.

???The ""baseline usage"" figure -- included near the bottom of PG&E bills --
represents the minimal amount of power consumers require. It includes a number
of variables, such as climate, time of year and type of fuel used.

???The PUC said about half of all utility customers statewide historically 
stay
within 130 percent of baseline limits.

???Heavy residential users whose electricity usage tops 400 percent of 
baseline
figures would see power bills rise by as much as 40 percent. Heavy commercial
and industrial users would see bills rise by more than 50 percent.

???The average increase for all PG&E residential customers would be about 16
percent, the PUC said, although this number is skewed by the addition of all
those customers whose bills would remain unchanged.

???Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights
in Santa Monica, questioned whether these rate increases will be sufficient to
motivate greater conservation among consumers and thus ease California's 
energy
woes.

???He called instead for the state's political leaders to seize generating
plants from out-of-state power companies and impose a special tax on the
companies' ""windfall"" profits.

???""Unless our elected officials take action, this is just the beginning of 
our
rate increases,"" Rosenfield warned.

???FEDERAL BUILDINGS IN SIGHTS

???One of the main differences between the two rate-increase proposals is
Lynch's inclusion of a ""real-time pricing program"" for federal agencies.

???If enacted, she said, federal buildings in California would be fully 
exposed
to the volatile wholesale power market and would pay whatever California pays 
to
keep the lights on throughout the day.

???Lynch denied that this is an effort on the part of California officials to
drive home to federal authorities the impact of sky-high wholesale 
electricity 
prices.

???""It's just an experiment,"" she said.

???While California officials have called on federal regulators and the Bush
administration to assist the state by capping wholesale power prices, 
Washington
has provided only limited relief to date.

???The Utility Reform Network's Finkelstein complained that the proposed rate
increases place a severe burden on residential customers when commercial and
industrial users account for the greater percentage of power consumption.

???""It was the commercial and industrial customers who were clamoring for
deregulation,"" he said. ""You didn't hear any calls for deregulation from
residential customers.""

???Lynch said she was aware that residential users are being asked to carry a
high proportion of the load but said efforts to force industrial users to pay
higher rates ran into political opposition.E-mail David Lazarus at

John Morel has asked all of you to take a few minutes to report placement
information through BEARTracks.  I know that you're very busy, but this is
really, really important information for us.  There are a number of reasons
why this information is critical:

(1)  We are very often asked for this data by prospective students who want
to know if the  MBA Program is ""worth it.""   This data we are able to
present to them is critical to our marketing efforts.

(2)  We often have to report this information to survey administrators
(e.g., Bus Week, etc.), who then plug it into their methodologies.  If we
don't have the information, or if we have skewed information because too
few people have reported the data, it places us at risk in the rankings.

So please take a few minutes out to report your placement information on
BearTracks.  I've copied John Morel's e-mail, below.

Many thanks,

Online college library and research firm slows pace, reduces staff by almost 
half 
By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Questia Media laid off half of its work force Tuesday in an effort to reduce 
costs. 
The developer of an online library and research site for college students cut 
139 jobs as it begins to slow down the pace at which books are added to the 
site. 
Founder Troy Williams said the company is finding it too hard to raise enough 
additional cash from investors to justify the pace at which it was adding 
books. 
""Customers have said they're generally satisfied with the number of books 
that are on the site right now, so it's a good time to slow down,"" Williams 
said of the 35,000 books currently available. ""A significant number of our 
people were involved in that process."" 
At one time, Questia employed more than 300 workers but cut back to about 280 
in recent weeks. The layoffs will leave the staff at about 140. 
No senior vice presidents are leaving as part of the layoffs, but Williams 
said a number of vice presidents and director-level employees have been cut. 
Laid-off employees will receive eight weeks of pay and 60 days of benefits, 
Williams said. 
""We've tried to be as humane as we could about the whole thing,"" Williams 
said. 
Williams said Questia's layoffs are not a result of the company growing too 
large too fast. 
""It took that many people to launch the service,"" Williams said. ""But since 
we're not digitizing books that quickly, we just don't need that many."" 
Questia was started in 1998 by Williams with the backing of investors such as 
Compaq Computer Corp. co-founder Rod Canion and Enron Chairman Ken Lay. 
The company raised more than $135 million over the past two years to build an 
online searching and note-taking interface and so far has purchased the 
rights to digitize more than 60,000 books. The company charges students about 
$20 per month for unlimited access and pays publishers based on the number of 
page views their books get from students. 
The site went live in early January but had trouble attracting the number of 
subscribers the company originally hoped for. 
In early April, following an intense television ad blitz during the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association's men's basketball tournament, the company 
had slightly more than of 1,000 paying subscribers, sources close to the 
company say. 
Company officials always said building the subscriber base would be an 
expensive long-term project. 
Several adjustments in strategy over the 14 weeks since the service launched 
indicate the original plans weren't panning out. 
On-campus membership drives were shifted first from community colleges to a 
handful of large major universities, a television ad campaign was launched 
months earlier than expected, while an early mascot was pushed into the 
background in favor of a simpler marketing message. 
The changes in strategy appear to be paying off as subscribership has jumped 
significantly in recent weeks. 
Williams wouldn't discuss the numbers, but sources say that figure has topped 
5,000. 
""We've had a fivefold increase in the number of paying subscribers in the 
past two weeks alone, which is a significant proof point in students' 
willingness to pay for such a service,"" Williams said. 
The company has offered the service free to nearly 100,000 students and 
faculty at four universities in recent weeks, an effort that is expected to 
bear fruit in new subscribers next fall. 
With current subscriber growth projections, he said the company is expected 
to have a positive cash flow in about 18 months. 
Questia is expected to close on another round of funding from a group of 
investors in several weeks. 
""We're very sanguine about the future,"" Williams said. ""We have to buckle 
down over the summer. We're a very cyclical business, so we're not going to 
make great strides over the summer.""

Key indexes finished mixed Tuesday but more stocks rose than fell as Wall 
Street struggled for direction ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting next 
week. 
In the bond market short-term yields fell further, and long-term yields 
inched up after the government's disappointing report on first-quarter worker 
productivity.
The Dow Jones industrials eased 51.66 points, or 0.5%, to 10,883.51, the 
fourth loss in five sessions, as the 11,000 mark again proves to be a barrier 
for the blue-chip index. 
But the Nasdaq composite index rose 25.20 points, or 1.2%, to 2,198.77 as 
semiconductor and computer networking stocks rose ahead of Cisco Systems' 
quarterly earnings report, released after regular trading ended. 
Cisco's operating results slightly beat estimates, but the company reported a 
massive net loss as it wrote down the value of excess inventory. Cisco 
shares, which rallied $1.13 to $20.38 in regular trading, fell to $19.90 in 
after-hours activity. 
In the broad market Tuesday, winners edged losers by 21 to 17 on Nasdaq and 
by 16 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume was moderate. 
Some analysts were impressed by the market's strength, especially in the wake 
of the downbeat productivity report. 
The government said worker productivity fell at a 0.1% rate in the first 
quarter, the first decline in five years. The report, though not entirely 
unexpected, raised fears about inflationary pressures in the economy. 
Productivity gains had helped hold inflation to a minimum in the late 1990s. 
Long-term Treasury bond yields rose modestly Tuesday as traders registered 
their concern about inflation's trend. 
The 10-year T-note yield ended at 5.24%, up from 5.19% Monday. 
But shorter-term yields continued to slide as traders bet that the Fed, which 
meets Tuesday, will cut its key short-term lending rate for a fifth time this 
year. 
The six-month T-bill yield slid to a new two-year low of 3.69% from 3.72% 
Monday. 
Though the central bank may lower short-term rates further, the productivity 
report ""increases the likelihood that the Fed will have to reverse course 
next year,"" raising rates to contain inflation, Henry Willmore, chief U.S. 
economist at Barclays Capital, told Bloomberg News. 
Among Tuesday's market highlights: 
* Financial stocks remained under pressure on concerns about loan losses and 
weaker borrowing in the struggling economy. American Express fell $1.93 to 
$41.30 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock. 
J.P. Morgan Chase fell $1.45 to $47.75, Bank One lost 94 cents to $37.46 and 
Northern Trust fell $1.49 to $64.71. 
* Chip stocks were strong, led by PMC-Sierra, up $4.79 to $44.10; Vitesse 
Semiconductor, up $2.60 to $36.25; and Broadcom, up $2.24 to $44.53. 
But among personal computer stocks, Dell lost $1.08 to $24.83 after 
announcing new job cuts. 
Dell rival Compaq fell 27 cents to $16.83 and Apple Computer eased 39 cents 
to $24.57. 
* Among blue chips, 3M fell $1.54 to $116.36. Chief Executive James McNerney 
said at 3M's annual meeting that there are ""no signs"" the global economy will 
turn around any time soon. 
* Utility and energy-trading stocks were weak. Enron fell $1.93 to $56.11, 
Orion Power lost $1.04 to $28.76 and NRG Energy fell $1.64 to $31.07.

JAPAN: Japan power market not fair for newcomers-Enron.

05/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant Enron Corp said on Wednesday that 
Japan's newly deregulated power market lacked competition and contained 
barriers that were deterring new entrants. 
""There's no real competition in the power market,"" Nicholas J.O'Day, vice 
president of Enron Japan Corp told reporters.
A number of unnecessary regulations, the high costs of the transmission 
network and other factors have thwarted attempts by newcomers to enter the 
power market, he said, adding that more reforms were needed. 
New entrants have to borrow the transmission network system from power 
utilities when they try to enter the market, but it was hard to judge whether 
the transmission fees reflect real costs, he said. 
Since March last year, non-utility firms have been allowed to begin supplying 
power to large-lot commercial users, ending a monopoly by Japan's 10 power 
utilities. 
The move was aimed at lowering electricity rates, which are much higher than 
in most Western economies. 
Yet the ratio of newcomers in the power market now stands at at only 0.2 
percent of the total. 
Enron also said that it would be necessary for Japan to set up an independent 
regulator to promote more competition in the power market. 
""It's OK if the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METT) could act as a 
regulator,"" he said, but added that METI's traditional relationship with 
power utilities may prevent it from being a fair regulator. 
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, set up its 
first joint venture in Japan in 1999, named ""E Power"". Enron Japan itself was 
set up last May. 
In March, Enron presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired 
power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to 
build such a plant in Japan.

Enron Official: Japan Needs Independent Power Regulator

Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan's power industry needs a strong independent 
regulator in order to become truly competitive, an Enron Japan Corp. official 
said Wednesday. 
""Japan is in a new global environment now. It requires new structures for its 
economy,"" said Nicholas J. O'Day, vice president at Enron Japan, a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Houston-based Enron Corp. (ENE).
While he said that the existing Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry might 
rise to fill the role, he expressed concerns that the ministry would be able 
to serve an impartial role given the historical relationship between it and 
the incumbent utilities. That relationship might make it difficult for the 
ministry to objectively treat new entrants to the power field, he said. 
Launched in April 2000, Enron Japan is focusing its business on areas such as 
electricity trading and marketing, and trading in weather derivatives, 
nonferrous metals and financial products. It has also said it plans to 
introduce broadband services in Japan. 
""Contrary to popular belief, Enron is not out to destroy the existing Japan 
utilities,"" O'Day said. 
Rather, he said, Enron maintains that increased liquidity is a vital factor 
to bring about a competitive environment. 
Enron is basing its conclusions on a report by U.S.-based Brattle Group, 
O'Day said. The consultancy was commissioned by Enron to assess the state of 
Japan's power industry and make suggestions for reform. 
The Brattle report will be released May 15 at an Enron co-sponsored seminar 
in Tokyo called, ""Reassessing Power Deregulation.""

UK: INTERVIEW-U.S. Williams enters Europe energy markets.
By Stuart Penson

05/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Williams is gearing up for a 
push into Europe's deregulating gas and power markets where it will focus on 
trying to sell its expertise in trading and risk management to local 
utilities. 
Williams will launch a European operation in London next week with an initial 
staff of 25 trading energy in the UK, German, Scandinavia and the Benelux 
region, the London unit's managing director told Reuters in an interview on 
Tuesday.
""The majority of our business will be around structured transactions to 
assist utilities in maximising the value of their assets,"" said Tim Loposer. 
Williams in Europe would at a later stage expand into trading crude oil and 
refined products, he said. 
GROWING BAND OF U.S. TRADERS IN EUROPE 
Williams is the latest addition to a growing band of U.S. energy companies 
setting up offices in London, a location they see as the ideal base from 
which to tap into Europe's potentially lucrative energy markets. 
Free trading in gas and power is gaining momentum across the European Union 
as markets open up to competition in line with EU directives on 
liberalisation. 
UBS Warburg in a recent report estimated profits from gas and power trading 
this year in Europe would amount to $1.9 billion, rising to $2.4 billion next 
year. 
Companies such as El Paso Energy , Duke Energy , ENRON AEP and TXU Europe are 
already building trading books in the UK and mainland Europe. 
""We are trying to differentiate ourselves from the other U.S. companies that 
have come to Europe,"" said Loposer. ""We are not just a trader and we are not 
a utility, or a significant owner of generation,"" he said. 
Unlike some of its U.S. rivals, Williams was not planning to acquire physical 
assets, such as power stations, in Europe, said Loposer. 
""What we are looking for are incumbent utilities which are looking for a 
partner to help extract value from their assets,"" he said. 
""We take care of the physical commodity risk as well as the financial risks, 
we are very comfortable doing this,"" said Loposer, adding the strategy in 
Europe essentially would mirror the company's approach in the U.S. 
Williams approach will be based on the use of structured deals, or 
combinations of different trading tools like futures and options. 
Loposer said the company also would look to bring to Europe experience from 
the U.S. market of tolling deals, which involve delivering fuel to power 
stations and then marketing the power generated. 
SOUTHERN EUROPE AN EARLY TARGET 
Loposer said his team already was targeting Spain and Italy in its search for 
risk management contracts. 
""We are very close to some announcements, there are three or four deals that 
may come through,"" he said. 
""Clearly southern Europe has strong growth,"" said Loposer. ""The divestments 
are happening there and the fundamentals are fairly strong. That said, we 
have learned that things can change overnight,"" he added.

INDIA: Enron moves execs families out of India - paper.

05/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, May 9 (Reuters) - Families of executives overseeing U.S. energy giant 
Enron Corp's troubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC) project in India are leaving 
the country, possibly signalling an intention to terminate the nearly 
complete $2.9 billion project, an India newspaper said on Wednesday. 
The Times of India said the children of Enron executives had been pulled out 
of the American School in Bombay as their families were being relocated to 
Singapore.
It also said security around the expatriate executives had been tightened, 
and personal bodyguards assigned to senior executives. 
But the unsourced report said it was not clear if the decision to move the 
families out of Bombay was made by Houston-based Enron, or reflected personal 
decisions made by the executives themselves. 
A spokesman for Dabhol Power Co, the operator of the nearly complete 2,184 MW 
power plant south of Bombay, told Reuters it was company policy not to 
comment on administrative and personnel matters. 
The newspaper said security had been tightened because ""there is likely to be 
a tremendous backlash against representatives of the U.S.-based energy 
company"" if the project was terminated. 
It said ""more than 15,000 jobs in Dabhol will be lost if a decision is taken 
either to terminate the project or stop construction on Phase II"". 
The project is mired in controversy after the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board (MSEB) reneged on its commitment to buy all the power produced by the 
giant plant, saying it is too costly. 
MSEB has also defaulted on monthly payments to DPC for the electricity it has 
taken, forcing the company's board last month to authorise the management to 
terminate the contract.

India: Dabhol: MSEB denies capacity underutilisation

Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 8. OFFICIALS of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), 
in a presentation made before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory 
Commission (MERC), today refuted claims that the board underutilised its own 
capacity to justify power purchase from Enron's Dabhol Power Company. 
Members of Prayas, a non-government organisation, in a petition filed with 
MERC, had accused MSEB of flouting merit order dispatch of load shedding to 
justify DPC phase II.
They had also said the State would have 2000 MW of excess power if hydro 
power was fully utilised and MSEB's Uran plant was used at full capacity. 
MSEB officials explained that the board could not use hydro electricity 
beyond its current capacity. 
""DPC power was drawn by and large to remedy low frequency conditions as the 
supply from other sources was not sufficient,"" a senior MSEB official said in 
his presentation. 
The officials said the Uran plant was being underutilised due to lack of LNG 
availability. 
The use of furnace oil as feedstock would cost the board Rs 16,000 per tonne, 
resulting in per unit costs of Rs 4, the official said. 
The board was already making optimum use of its thermal power capacity. 
According to an official, 95 per cent of DPC power was used to sustain 
frequency as per the Indian Electricity Grid Code. 
""Load shedding has always been carried out in consultation with the Western 
Regional Load Dispatch Centre,"" he said.

MSEB ropes in HC judge as arbitrator

05/09/2001
The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

THE MSEB on Tuesday appointed a former Bombay High Court judge ML Pendse as 
its arbitrator, reports Girish Kuber in Mumbai. The formal announcement about 
Mr Pendses appointment is expected by Wednesday.
Enron already has appointed its arbitrator. According to government sources 
once the two parties complete their formalities for appointing an arbitrator, 
the case will be tried in London. According to the PPA the dispute resolution 
clause states that disputes should be referred to an expert for technical 
matters. 
And in other cases, the resolution should be by reference to arbitration to 
be conducted under the New York Convention of 1958 and to be located in 
London. 
MSEB had delayed the monthly payments of electricity bills from October last 
year and subsequently defaulted on payments, claiming that the cost of power 
produced by DPC was exorbitant. It also slapped two penalty bills of around 
Rs 800 crore on Enron for failing to generate electricity within the 
stipulated time period of three hours. 
Enron subsequently has invoked state guarantees, counter-guarantees and 
political force majeure, and then went on to invoke the arbitration clause. 
Meanwhile, the Madhav Godbole panel is yet to receive the names of the 
members of Enrons lenders and share holders who will be attending the first 
meeting with the state government panel on May 11. 
The Godbole panel has been appointed with a mandate to renegotiate the PPA 
with DPC. 
Though Enron has accepted the invitation, it has made it clear that it is 
meeting the panel as a courtesy and it should not seen as its willingness to 
renegotiate the PPA.

SJM demands probe into Enron deal

The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), an arm of the RSS, has demanded a judicial 
probe into the Enron deal, while investigating the role of politicians and 
bureaucrats in the controversy-ridden power project. 
Ramesh Seth, convener of SJM, Mumbai and Anil Gachke, convener of SJM's 
national action group on power, have alleged that while examining the 
feasibility of the project, inflated and fabricated figures of demand for 
power were given by those in power.
When pointed out that this would mean an examination of leaders like Gopinath 
Munde, Sharad Pawar and Balasaheb Thackeray, Gachke said that a probe should 
be instituted irrespective of political affiliations. 
Gachke said the SJM would not budge from their stand of cancellation of the 
deal. Seth, a qualified engineer, had predicted on behalf of the Manch that 
Enron power would cost Rs seven per unit in 1996, which was way higher than 
the actual cost of power. 
To make people aware of the issue, they have organised a seminar 'Enron
-review and thereafter', which will be held today at Ghia Hall, Kala Ghoda at 
2 pm.

Plans for more power from Uran unlikely: MSEB
Business Times Bureau

05/09/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: The Maharashtra State Electricity Board has stated to the Maharashtra 
Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) that MSEB's plans to generate more 
power from its idle Uran plant in order to avoid expensive Dabhol power, are 
unlikely to materialise due to the high costs involved. 
In a hearing that took place on Tuesday, against a petition filed by SR 
Paranjpe, MSEB officials made it clear to the Commission that it has to pay 
Rs 16,000 per tonne for furnace oil to Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilisers 
(RCF) which makes the power costlier from Uran.
This was because as per the plans worked out by the Union ministry of 
petroleum and natural gas, MSEB can avail of additional natural gas from GAIL 
by diverting the gas allocated to RCF. In turn, the Board is expected to pay 
up the differential price to RCF. But MSEB, in its reply to a question during 
the hearing, stated that fuel (furnace oil) for RCF costs Rs 16,000 per tonne 
and if the differential price is to be borne by it, then the cost of power 
generated from the Uran plant will be over Rs 4 per unit. This, the Board 
claims, will make it an unviable proposal to be implemented. 
However, the petitioner has challenged this claim made by MSEB and MERC has 
asked to present written submissions before the Commission this week. 
MSEB's Uran plant has a capacity of 913 MW, but only around 300 MW is being 
generated due to lack of natural gas. This arrangement, initiated by the 
ministry to offer more natural gas to MSEB, follows a representation made by 
CM Vilasrao Deshmukh last month. 
Currently, MSEB has been allocated only 1.6 mmtpa natural gas from GAIL since 
the output from ONGC's Bombay High has depreciated in the recent past, said 
sources. Union petroleum minister Ram Naik had earlier announced that the 
ministry would take all efforts to allocate more natural gas to Uran. 
The petition had challenged that MSEB had violated the merit order despatch 
and purchased more power from Enron violating the limits set by MERC in its 
May 5 order. The Commission will issue an order soon after the petitioners 
submit their affidavits responding to MSEB's reply to the charges made 
against them.

MUMBAI: Is Enron preparing to pull out of India? Officially, the answer's 
``no''. But in a significant move, the families of the expatriate executives 
working in its subsidiary, the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), have been shifted 
out of Mumbai and relocated to Singapore. 
In addition, the security cover for expatriate executives working in DPC has 
been tightened, including personal bodyguards for senior executives.
According to sources, the families have been shifted from Mumbai and the 
children of these executives studying in the American School in Bandra-Kurla 
have been pulled out. An American School spokesperson refused to comment when 
asked about this. 
An Enron spokesperson, when contacted, also declined to comment. ""It is our 
corporate policy not to comment on personnel and administrative matters,"" he 
said. 
It is not clear if the decision to move the families out of Mumbai was taken 
at the corporate level in DPC or whether the decision has been a personal one 
taken by the expatriate executives themselves. 
About 15 expatriate officials are working in DPC as part of the management 
and operations team. 
According to the sources, uncertainty over the fate of the $2 billion project 
has led Enron's expatriate executives to move their families out of Mumbai. 
This is because in the event of the power project being terminated in the 
next few weeks, expatriate officials feel that there is likely to be a 
tremendous backlash against representatives of the US-based energy company. 
Over 15,000 jobs in Dabhol will be lost if a decision is taken either to 
terminate the project or to stop construction work on phase II of the DPC 
project. 
The security around the expatriate officials still working to salvage the 
project in Mumbai has been tightened. In addition, some of the senior DPC 
officials have been allocated security personnel to act as their bodyguards. 
The Enron spokesperson said that the company had just moved its premises to a 
new building in the Bandra-Kurla complex and the security needs of the 
company have changed. ""We have no extra security than is absolutely 
necessary"", he maintained. 
It is unclear what will be the fate of the project, with Kenneth Lay, the 
chairman of Enron Corp, using his veto power to dissuade the Enron board from 
terminating the project earlier this week. 
A team of Enron executives is scheduled to meet the government next week to 
discuss the reccommendations of the Godbole Committee, set up to review the 
power purchase agreement by the Maharashtra government.

Dabhol lenders willing to back PPA termination
Our Banking Bureau Mumbai

The Maharashtra government's tough stance, combined with the Centre's silence 
on honouring its counter-guarantee for December last year which has been 
invoked by the Dabhol Power Company, has left the lenders to the project with 
no choice but to say yes to DPC's plan of serving the power purchase 
agreement termination notice. 
""If the governments (Centre and state) do not come forward to resolve the 
crisis, it will be difficult for the lenders to convince the company to keep 
the decision of terminating the PPA in abeyance. We had got a three-week 
reprieve and we will not be in a position to stretch it further,"" said a 
source among the lenders. The deadline expires on May 15.
At the DPC board meeting in London in the last week of April, the resolution 
on PPA termination was passed by a 7:1 vote. The lone voice of dissent was 
that of the representative of the Industrial Development Bank of India on the 
DPC board. 
The three Maharashtra State Electricity Board representatives were not 
allowed to vote since they were an interested party. 
""At best, the lender's representative will abstain from voting at the next 
meeting. We have no moral rights to oppose the move,"" said another source. 
The only positive development for which the lenders can claim credit for is 
MSEB's payment of Rs 134 crore, that too, under protest. 
""The escrow account with Canara Bank has not yet been activated. A string of 
clearances has been pending with the state government. The Centre is also not 
willing to honour its counter-guarantee. The lenders have not been able to 
achieve any thing,"" sources added. 
DPC had invoked the political force majeure clause in its contract with the 
board. MSEB is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has absolved 
DPC of all its liabilities. 
The DPC board authorised the managing director of Enron India to issue a 
notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to MSEB and the state 
government. 
Serving of the notice requires backing of the lenders who have an exposure of 
about $200 crore in the project.

Prize Petroleum eyes Enron stake in Panna, Mukta

Prize Petroleum Company Ltd has decided to enter the oil and gas production 
sector by trying to acquire the 30 per cent Enron equity in the Panna, Mukta 
and Tapti fields in western offshore and has valued Enron's equity at around 
Rs 600 crore. 
Prize Petroleum, in which Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) holds 50 
per cent equity, will invest Rs 1,900 crore in the project. Of this, Rs 1,300 
crore will be the debt component and the balance will be in the form of 
equity.
Prize Petroleum, in which ICICI has 45 per cent stake and HDFC 5 per cent, is 
in talks with a number of banks to raise the debt portion of the investment. 
Sources told Business Standard that a substantial portion of the debt has 
already been finalised and the balance is expected to be clinched shortly. 
This will be Prize Petroleum's maiden foray into the oil sector. Its 
promoters had decided to go in for only the discovered fields where risks are 
low. As a result, it refrained from participating in the two rounds of 
exploration acreage offered under the new exploration licensing policy. 
Of late, Enron has been uncomfortable operating the three offshore fields 
which had been awarded to the Enron-Reliance consortium in 1995. Late last 
year, it announced its intention to pull out of the project and invited bids 
to farm out its portion of the equity. 
The award of the three fields to the consortium was the subject of prolonged 
controversies, both inside and outside Parliament. It was ultimately cleared 
by the Supreme Court when the apex court rejected a public interest 
litigation against the award. 
An estimated $696 million has been spent on the development of Panna and 
Mukta. It is learnt that the consortium has put up three well-head platforms 
in the two fields which are estimated to have 146 million barrels of oil 
reserves. Tapti is primarily a gas field. 
ONGC holds 40 per cent stake in this project with Reliance and Enron holding 
30 per cent equity each.

California 's Electric Lottery 
Golden State residents used an impressive 9% less electricity in the past two 
months than they did during the same time last year, but it won't be enough 
to dodge rolling blackouts this summer. Southern California Edison is 
assigning each of its 4.3 million customers a number from one to 114 that 
groups customers in a specific set of circuits totaling 100 megawatts. So 
when, for example, the utility has to cut 500 megawatts of power, five 
groupings will lose power for an hour. The numbers will be announced on radio 
and TV, much like a lottery. But everyone will lose in this lottery, which 
has been brought on by the stubborn refusal of California 's politicians to 
override environmental objections to new power plants and then their efforts 
to cap prices on the remaining power. ",05/08/2001,,"Wall Street Journal REVIEW & OUTLOOK Dow Jones & Company, Inc. dodge"

378,"Hi All- 

Enron has decided to outsource our accounts payable department and also 
implement a whole new system for paying invoices.
What this means to all of us is you may receive email(s) from iBuyit 
Payables.  These are very important emails!  These are invoices
that need to be paid.  Any ENA people receiving invoices should automatically 
assume they go to me.  As for Sue's group I think
any invoices you receive will need to go to Joseph.  If you are unsure please 
let he or I know and we can figure out which one of us should
get the invoice.

Here is the irritating part: You can not just forward the iBuyit Payables 
email to me/him.  You must click onto the first link in the email (see 
example below).
Then log on to the iBuyit Payables system using your P00# and log-on password 
(these are the same P00# and password you use to access
eHRonline).  At this point you will be at your iBuyit Payables in-box.  I 
pasted a copy of my in-box below as an example.  There are boxes to check
if you want to forward the invoice.  If you check them all then click on 
'Quick Forward' a forward box will appear.  Type in mine, or Joseph's (if 
it's his
invoice) last name in the 'last name' box, then click search.  From there you 
can click 'Forward'.  I will not only ensure the invoice is paid, but also 
give the vendor the correct information for future invoices.

Please bare with me during this time.  This whole process isn't going to be 
very much fun for any of us.  However, I have made it my priority to have 
this new invoice situation organized as quickly as possible.  If anyone has 
any questions please let me know.  On one last note:  All paper invoices 
should still be given directly to me then I can send them to A/P for scanning.

Qatar, UAE Dolphin Proj Gas Price About $1.30/M BTUs-MEES

05/07/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- The fiscal price for natural gas from Qatar's North Field 
to be supplied on a CIF basis under the Dolphin project to Abu Dhabi is 
around $1.30 per million British Thermal Units, the Middle East Economic 
Survey reported Monday, citing sources. 
The price includes the basic production price agreed on by Qatar Petroleum 
(QP) and the UAE Offsets Group, or UOG, plus the costs of compression and 
transportation of the gas through a 350-kilometer pipeline along with 
seasonal adjustments for peak demand, MEES said.
The Dolphin project is a $3.5 billion deal agreed to two years ago by UOG and 
QP aimed at sending 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's 
offshore North Field, piped by sea to Abu Dhabi and also for onward delivery 
to Dubai and possibly Oman. 
MEES said the $1.30 per million BTU price will also be subject to 2% annual 
escalation. 
Qatar had hoped for a higher basic price but instead, an agreement was 
reached whereby upward adjustments were made to the quantities of liquids 
stripped from the gas under the prospective production sharing agreement, or 
PSA, thereby increasing Qatar's revenue, MEES added. 
QP and Dolphin Energy Ltd., or DEL, a subsidiary of UOG, signed a term sheet 
agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. 
The next step will be for the two parties to sign the full PSA for the 2 
billion cubic feet a day to be delivered over 25 years to the U.A.E. 
The term sheet specified the PSA would be signed by September at the latest, 
MEES said. 
TotalFinaElf (F.TFE) and Enron Corp. (ENE) each hold a 24.5% stake and UOG a 
51% stake in DEL. 
TotalFinaElf is to operate the upstream phase of the project, which includes 
developing natural gas reserves in two blocks of Qatar's giant offshore North 
Field, in which the first wells are scheduled to be drilled in the second 
half of 2001 and come onstream in 2005. Enron will focus on gas 
transportation, which requires building the 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Al-Taweelah terminal in Abu 
Dhabi and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
A further phase of the Dolphin project will cover the delivery of an 
additional 1 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, if it is deemed 
feasible. 
MEES said the foreign partners have yet to agree on the precise details of 
their working relationship and on the price of the pipeline. TotalFinaElf and 
DEL have said Enron's estimated price for the pipeline is too high. Sales and 
purchase agreements with U.A.E. customers are also not yet concluded.

California regulators told congressional lawmakers on Thursday that clean air 
regulations are not to blame for the state's electricity shortages and said 
new legislation seeking to ease air quality rules was unneeded. 
Speaking at a House Commerce Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee hearing, the 
head of the California Air Resources Board repeatedly said environmental 
regulations should not be suspended for the sake of electricity. 
""Air quality laws are not interfering with California's ability to bring new 
generation on line and run existing power plants at maximum capacity,"" said 
Michael Kenny, executive officer of the board. 
When asked by Democratic lawmakers on the panel about a provision in a 
pending electricity bill, the California regulator said the state did not ask 
for a relaxation of clean air rules and did not need the change. 
""We believe that air quality-related sections of the legislation are 
unnecessary,"" Kenny said. 
Rep. Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who chairs the energy subcommittee, 
said the measures allow flexibility to states for the temporary suspension of 
environmental laws. He said the key point of his bill is to ensure the lights 
stay on in California this summer. 
The Golden State expects to face threats of blackouts starting this month, 
when air conditioning use accelerates. 
Objections raised by Kenny to the Barton bill included disagreement on a 
section allowing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to waive, when 
asked by a state, the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act pertaining to 
nitrogen oxide emissions. 
Kenny said the state already gives flexibility on the issue and contended the 
legislation would go too far and be problematic. 
""The waiver applies to all new generation facilities in the state and does 
not allow for consideration on a case-by-case (generating plant by generating 
plant) basis, where unique local factors can be weighed,"" said Kenny.

385,"This afternoon I met with Kurt Lindahl and Jody Crook (Global Energy Markets) 
concerning a proposal to bring LNG into California.

The project consists of converting an oil tanker into a floating vaporization 
facility, anchoring it off the coast of California and constructing a subsea 
pipeline to bring the gas onshore.  The facility would have a daily unloading 
rate of 500,000 mmbtu/d.  Approximately 172,000 mmbtu/d would go directly to 
market, with the remainder being injected into utility storage facilities for 
ultimate withdrawal prior to arrival of a new shipment of LNG.  The goal is 
to baseload a market of 172,000 mmbtu/d.

The project would have a start-up date in early 2003.  While other proposals 
are being considered to bring LNG into California, the Enron proposal is 
unique in that it is considering onshore gas storage vs offshore LNG 
storage.  Retrofitting the oil tanker takes approximately 18 months.  
Constructing an offshore LNG storage facility would take 3 years -  providing 
Enron a competitive advantage with respect to timing.   To protect this 
competitive advantage during the development stage of the project, it has 
been requested that this particular aspect  be kept confidential as long as 
possible.

Kurt and Jody have meetings scheduled next week in California with at least 
two utilities to discuss operational and tariff considerations associated 
with the utilities' providing storage service.  I am providing analysis of 
SoCalGas's storage tariff and have been requested to review  ts reflection in 
the economic modeling of the project.  Other regulatory support I assume 
would be required with respect to FERC and or CPUC authorizations.

Jeff, is this something that can be woven into the overall California 
Solutions proposal, and, how would this fit into the discussions currently 
ongoing with respect to adequacy of the California gas delivery 
infrastucture.  As this proposal would deliver gas closer to market (as 
oppossed to gas coming from the west) some savings in term of capital and 
fuel could be realized.

Kurt has offered to provide a more detailed briefing of the proposal at our 
request.

the losses to creditors are only reduced if someone overpays for the assets. 
Otherwise it just shrinks the enterprise value and debt $1:$1. The proceeds 
would first go to the secured mortgage bonds then to the unsecureds (they 
funded a good deal of the undercollection).

works for everyone.?  

I will take a shot at comparing the following for questions (a) and (b): 

(1) Home Depot's strategy (low margin, high turnover, high service, best 
quality products) with their financial ratios. 
(2) Home Depot's strategy with Hechinger's (upscale stores with high profit 
margins) by comparing their financial ratios. 

(Understand that I have not had the benefit of attending the last two 
classes, but hope to watch them on video tape before I send out my answers.) 

Mark has already addressed question (c), we just need to make clear in the 
memo the assumptions he used.? Mark - perhaps you could write those up so we 
can drop them into the memo?

The other big issue is with Home Depot's expansion strategy - should they 
continue to build the 9 new stores, and if so, how should they finance the 
expansion?? They could use their line of credit or go to the equity market.? 
Obviously with the line of credit we need to make sure that they can cover 
the interest expense and with the equity market we need to be careful of 
their depressed stock price.? Can someone else volunteer to look at the 
expansion efforts and financing (question d)?

I am going to work on this today and hope to e-mail it out by 9am tomorrow.? 
Can we set a time on Wednesday to discuss this live??

397,"Just met with the industry group trying to come up with a solution for 
California.  The group liked our portfolio approach. In sum: 

A portfolio approach is the right long-term solution.
In the short run, our illustrative portfolios show that the utilities ought 
to immediately fill a modest portion of their requirements via fixed-price, 
long term contracts, and those contracts should be found reasonable, up 
front, so long as the utility uses a competitive auction.  To stimulate 
discussion we proposed that the utility fill 5% of its net short position 
with 5-year, fixed-price contracts and 5% from 10-year, fixed-price contracts.

Everyone on the call liked the proposal.  After some discussion about whether 
5%-5% was the right one, Edison agreed to come to Friday's meeting with its 
proposal for price/term/quantity that it ought to contract for immediately.  
(Edison may want the number to be higher, and the baskets to be different.)

Anything can happen between now and Friday, but thus far looks positive.  
Thanks to everyone for the help in getting the proposal together, Steve Swain 
in particular.  (Steve:  We may get asked to run a few more illustrative 
portfolios for the group.)  I'll report back on what happens at the meeting 
on Friday.  If there are any questions, etc., just let me know.

Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests 
Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Friday, March 16, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 

Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying 
electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential 
document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle. 
State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging 
$49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers 
figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests. 
The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources, 
which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of 
lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom 
Hannigan. 
To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much 
California is spending on power purchases. 
Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed, 
it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw 
it. 
""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R- 
Redding. 
Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity, 
analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could 
jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term. 
For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education 
programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst 
warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in 
Davis' proposed budget. 
Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit 
rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the 
utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a 
credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans 
to rise. 
""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive 
director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that 
tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the 
energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look 
like in the future."" 
The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent 
nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest 
day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per 
megawatt hour. 
Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison & 
Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices. 
""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he 
said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be."" 
The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the 
state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if 
generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could 
force up the price the next day. 
But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right 
to know how its money way being spent. 
""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he 
said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces."" 
Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have 
filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state 
has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by 
Davis. 
The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated 
only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if 
needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has 
sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional 
money was needed. 
Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5 
billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending 
$43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water 
Resources document. 
Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has 
become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a 
house of cards. 
The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is 
supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will 
be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every 
month.

Gray Davis is offering rebates for Californians who save on power starting in 
June, and if you've got a strategy for conserving, The Chronicle wants to

458,"There is a new version of Stack Manager which is being released this evening, 
for use on Monday morning.

Changes

1) ""Inactivate Suspended Children"" - New menu item available by 
right-clicking on a Parent Product. It will change all Child Products of the 
highlighted parent from ""Suspended"" to ""Inactive"". Note that this will be 
applied only to the product which you highlight. It will also show available 
when highlighting Products which are not Parents, but it will have no effect.

2) The transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those 
transactions completed on the calendar day (problem has affected Australia 
and Singapore).

3) A Constant Spread which is changed from the front page of the Stack 
Manager will stay as changed for that Product. The spread will persist even 
if transactions occur.


Background

Suspended Child Products continue to have their prices updated as the price 
of the Parent changes. Inactive Child Products do not have their prices 
updated. The price update process slows down EnronOnline processing and Stack 
Manager response, so it is advantageous to ensure all non-active Products are 
in an Inactive state. 

If you have any questions on the above, please contact the EnronOnline call 
center at:

HPLC currently has a gas purchase agreement (global #96014987) in place with 
Calpine that extends through 5/31/2001.  Sitara deal no. 133259 correctly has 
this contract attached to it.  Effective 11/1/1998 the contract was amended 
releasing Gouger wells no. 5 & 6.  These wells were apparently the only 
producing wells behind this point.  Evidence being no measured volumes in 
MIPS.  There are however other non producing wells behind this point.  Is 
your Sept & Oct UA4 issue the direct result of volumes being scheduled at 
meter no. 4229?  If so, for November, the nom at this point will be taken to 
1mmbtu/d until the wells behind this point began to produce.

As far as meter 6835 (Roos #1 C/P) is concerned, HPLC also has a contract 
(#96003771) in place with Cokinos Nat Gas that is currently in an ""evergreen"" 
status.  The aforementioned wells were released from the Calpine contract; 
however, they were not added behind meter 6835.  Therefore, I do not agree 
that the deal (133259) should be edited to change the meter.

Hopefully this information is useful!

We are starting to prepare the February data for our model.  Please provide a 
completed ""Hours"" survey for each position within your group.  This survey 
will collect the the time your team spent on performing their activities in 
the month of February.  

At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labeled ""Select Your RC"".  
Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits.
Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message ""Select 
Position from Drop Box!"" You can then select the position (i.e., staff, 
specialist, etc.) and ""OK"". The choices for positions are based on 
information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed 
that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that 
corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of 
activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity 
listed in the column labeled ""Hours"".
If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the 
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.  
If you do not, the information will be lost.

We have included January compiled hours per position (if you had two 
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the ""Last Month"" 
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).  As with last month, you 
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send 
this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill 
out the time they spent on each activity.  If there are any activities you 
perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible 
for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.

The problem with the January payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly 
in sitara.   For January production deal 153864 shows HPLC purchasing gas 
from GMT Company Inc, not GMT Inc.  Someone needs to either correct the deal 
for 1/00 or put in a new deal, then I can do an accounting arrangement to 
make the necessary correction.    It is correct for 2/00 on deal 156292.  I

I didn't check voice mail until this morning (I don't have a blinking light.  
The assistants pick up our lines and amtel us when voice mails have been 
left.)  Anyway, with the uncertainty of the future business under the Texas 
Desk, the following are my goals for the next six months:

1)  Ensure a smooth transition of HPL to AEP, with minimal upsets to Texas 
business.
2)  Develop operations processes and controls for the new Texas Desk.   
3)  Develop a replacement
 a.  Strong push to improve Liz (if she remains with Enron and )
 b.  Hire new person, internally or externally
4)  Assist in develop a strong logisitcs team.  With the new business, we 
will need strong performers who know and accept their responsibilites.

1 and 2 are open-ended.  How I accomplish these goals and what they entail 
will depend how the Texas Desk (if we have one) is set up and what type of 
activity the desk will be invovled in, which is unknown to me at this time.  
I'm sure as we get further into the finalization of the sale, additional and 
possibly more urgent goals will develop.  So, in short, who knows what I need 
to do.

I just received notice from COR that they do ""not intend to schedule or pay for any further energy deliveries"" by Enron. The notice is dated May 30. Please let me know the instant Riverside refuses our energy delivery schedule. Since we have purchased the entire month of June, we will be in a position of liquidating that length should Riverside refuse delivery. Once Riverside refuses delivery,  we should plan on attempting to schedule at least once again to demonstrate their intent to continue to refuse delivery. Therefore, we need to discuss strategy before selling Riverside length back into the market or, alternatively, booking out with the energy supplier. Let me know if you have any questions.

	       West Market - 95% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD
	       East Market -  67% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD

The West and East are two separate markets for TW.  The majority of TW's business is the West market.  
The East market offers our shippers more flexibility.  The two percentages should stand alone and not be 
combined.

570,"Jeff (CES) and I just had a nice chat about the Choice program. Jeff 
mentioned the ""famous contracts"" that should be used for Choice Peaking 
outside the SST. I double checked with Joann and these contracts are being 
used for CES Endusers (C&I customers) as follows:

37956 600 CES EU
61822 4000 CES EU
61825 8000 CES EU
61838 1000 CES EU
61990 2000 CES EU
65402 13400 CES EU (contract total is 20,000)
65418 500 CES STOI
66931 4000 Jeff this is Enron's transport. The Paulding contract went away 
effective 4/1/2000.
67693 1200 CES EU
 Rest  CHOICE
38021 19041 CES EU (note... we are using Dayton, because not enough capacity 
for CES EU)
38021 27,000 STOI


If you want us to use these contracts for Choice, we would have to cut the 
CES EU volumes to 0. This would impact about 40 nominations on TCO side. You 
would have to ask Kara/Heidi/Kim/Donna... how many nom's on their side. 
Because of the labor involved and the general consensus not to cut CES EU 
markets, we have always left these nom's alone. We have found other capacity 
for Choice gas above the SST capacity (54,000 now and 134,000 in the winter). 
There are many different options... and we can discuss them over a conference 
call.

The other item to consider, the Choice program requires us to have some STOW 
to use to balance Choice burns. Currently, I have been doing 50/50 to 60/40 
split (pool/stow). The baseload target is 20,000. Actual STOW for April has 
been 2400 to 42,000 depending on mother nature. This is up for discussion... 
I used to discuss this with Paul and Noel on daily basis. Now, I'm just doing 
it on my own.

Lastly, our target for net STOI is 36,000 a day. We have been calling for 
overinjections, caused by mother nature and choice actuals. My understanding 
is that CES had a different goal for net STOI... we just need this clarified 
and can move forward for the rest of the month. We have typically tried to 
meet the EOM goal, not necessarily a daily goal because of choice actuals 
cause havoc. Therefore, we can get the net STOI back in line... with the 
remainding days.

Hope this covers it.

I am concerned that the Court may take the following view: (i) Enron has just advised us that it values this contract at over $2 million, so it presumably it does not want to terminate it for nothing; (ii) under the terms of the contract, our remedy for non-performance is arguably the right to be made whole for our incremental costs of replacing the underlivered gas supply, rather than contract termination, and there is no indication Enron, as debtor-in-possession, does not intend to honor that obligation.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco 
Transit for December or are we?  We expect that as the deals are entered into 
Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas.

Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm 
volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them..  Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal.  One ticket is 
for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by 
Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing) 
from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction 
in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the 
ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.
   
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?  You are.

BC Elections
According to our information, the BC government is preparing for the Liberal 
take this week.  The election is slated for 16 May 2001 and it appears likely 
that we are looking at a near Liberal sweep -- they are currently leading 41% 
to 25% at the polls.  There is about a three-week lead time between the 
general election on May 16th, the Final Count on May 29th, and the Return Day 
on June 7th -- so there will be a period of jockeying around some issues.  
The New Democratic Party (NDP) leader, Ujjal Dosanjh, has effectively 
conceded the election in a public announcement.  Dosanjh is making public 
pleas to voters not to desert the NDP in favor of the Greens so that the NDP 
can retain official party status (4 seats).  Dosanjh has stated that he ""will 
be happy if the NDP gets 10 to 15 seats.""

The following are likely to be the key energy policy officials once the 
Liberal Party takes power in BC:

? Richard Neufeld, Minister of Energy, Mines and Northern Development 
(replacing NDP Minister Glenn Robertson)
? Dan Jarvis, Deputy critic on Energy, Mines and Northern Development Murray 
Coell, Minister of Environment, Lands and Parks (replacing Ian Waddell) 
? John Van Dongen, Fisheries Neufeld, Jarvis, Coell and Van Dongen are 
currently Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs).

While Gordon Campbell, the probable incoming premier, will have been 
effectively muzzled in the interim when it comes to talk about energy 
deregulation, the opposition will likely have plenty to say about it.  The 
people we'll need to be looking at this regard are:  Glenn Robertson - 
Minister of Energy and Mines, and Ian Waddell - Minister of Environment, Land 
& Parks.  

It appears certain that the Liberals will move to privatize at least some of 
the power crown corporations almost immediately.  They have promised a 
balanced budget and a chunk of  money to do it their way; they have made 
campaign promises about privatization to stir the economy; and they have 
tight back channels with the crown corporations' management who want ""a 
straight privatization plan instead of coop approach to deregulation.""  
Sources report that, if elected, the Liberals promise a referendum on land 
claims treaties with the local native Indians (or ""First Nations"").  These 
treaties result from overlapping claims to land and serve to block land 
development, forestry, mining, etc.  While the NDP has been supportive of the 
First Nations land claims process while in office, the promised Liberal 
referendum would seem to suggest that the Liberals intend to backtrack and 
not recognize the First Nations' rights.  In other words, there would be an 
increased impetus for mining and forestry.  This development is surprising 
since the Liberals have traditionally enjoyed strong Indian support, and the 
land claims process was originally started under a Liberal government.  If 
the Liberals press forward with a referendum on the process, there is the 
potential for violent flare-ups between the First Nations and the 
government.  (These flare-ups have occurred in the past, though not recently.)

BPA
BPA is urging the White House to increase its authority to borrow from the 
federal Treasury by $2 billion to build over 20 new projects for 500-kilovolt 
transmission lines and substations online between 2003 and 2006.  BPA 
officials hope the new borrowing authority will be included in a 
comprehensive energy strategy the Bush administration is expected to release 
next week, although federal officials have yet to give the final word on the 
BPA request.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, key members of Congress and 
the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney, who has taken charge of developing 
the administration's energy strategy, all have been briefed on BPA's 
proposal.  BPA has been building a case for a budget item that officials say 
would be a significant boost to the region's power infrastructure in the near 
term. If the administration doesn't include it in its energy strategy, BPA 
officials say they will nevertheless press for the increased borrowing 
authority in Congress.   BPA plans for the first time to use more ""fish 
credits"" than cash to meet its annual debt obligation, reducing its cash 
outlay by some $400 million.  BPA had expected its borrowing authority to be 
sufficient until 2006, but given the energy situation, BPA could hit the 
ceiling by 2003. 

BPA will be spilling water over its dams as a part of the salmon protection 
plan.  To make up for the shortfall, the agency will have to repurchase 
approximately $1.2 billion on the electricity spot market -- these costs will 
be passed on to energy consumers as a part of the subscription rate hike in 
October.  Oregon Governor Kitzhaber is pushing for more spills.  Steve Wright 
& other BPA officials are considering the effects of keeping water in the 
reservoirs as a safety net, should there be a cold spell next winter, which 
has precipitated a federal lawsuit from 12 environmental organizations 
against the National Marine Fisheries Service.

Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund is leading this charge, a coalition which 
includes Trout Unlimited and the Sierra Club.  The official line is they want 
to disallow the Federal Caucus and BPA from declaring a 'fish emergency' 
which would allow them to determine the amount of water spilled over the 
dams, among other things.  However, by exercising a 'fish emergency', BPA 
becomes qualified for additional federal credits - which is probably the real 
source of contention here.

Aluminum Smelters
The bill passed by the House Energy Committee  yesterday does extend the 
resale rights of the smelters to 1500 megawatts of  power beyond the October 
2001 termination date.  BPA is negotiating, even though they have no legal  
obligation to serve the smelters.  New attack ads paid for by the  aluminum 
companies are running to build political pressure to continue to  receive and 
resell 1500 megawatts of power beyond October 2001, in addition to  receiving 
other payments for staying offline.","Ujjal Dosanjh Richard Neufeld Glenn Robertson Dan Jarvis Ian Waddell John Van Dongen Van Dongen Gordon Campbell Glenn Robertson -

Reform Of Investment Rules Urged
Financial Times - November 15, 2000

The European Commission is pressing for a radical overhaul of its investment
rules to keep up with the accelerating pace of change in securities markets
and to encourage more cross-border trade.

Frits Bolkestein, the EU's single market commissioner, will launch a
widespread consultation process on Thursday to discuss the changes needed to
the EU's investment services rules.

The update of the EU's investment services legislation is one of the top 10
priorities set by the Commission for its financial services work in the next
six months. EU heads of government want to complete the integration of the
financial market by 2005 as part of the drive to improve competitiveness.
Financial services accounts for 6 per cent of EU gross domestic product and
this is expected to grow rapidly as the euro and new technology lead to a
more integrated capital market.

Part of the drive to overhaul the investment legislation is the Commission's
recognition that its ""single passport"" rules allowing a firm to sell
investment services across the EU as long as it complies with supervisory
rules in its home country, do not work well in practice. This is because too
many countries impose their own additional, specifically local restrictions
in the name of investor protection.

The Commission now wants to ensure that home country rule is enforced for
all professional investors such as pension funds and other institutions and
any local restrictions removed. National supervisors may still impose some
restrictions on services provided to retail
investors, but these should be kept to a minimum. This involves countries
agreeing on a common definition for a professional investor - generally an
institution. But sophisticated individual investors can also apply to be
treated as professionals if they have enough experience and a large
portfolio.

Mr. Bolkestein also wants to stimulate discussion among countries about how
to achieve more common regulation of markets and trading systems, including
new electronic trading arrangements. It is vital for the Commission to
address the discrepancies in regulation between different markets.

There is a danger that EU rules will not keep up with the growing number of
mergers between securities exchanges and the development of electronic
marketplaces that are used across borders.

The consultation exercise will take place until March next year after which
the Commission will legislate.




US Election Has New Commodities Laws In Legislative Limbo
Dow Jones News Service - November 15, 2000
By Dawn Kopecki

Like everything else in Washington these days, the push for new U.S.
commodities laws is stuck in legislative limbo with an unresolved
presidential election and an undetermined end to the congressional session.

Lawmakers were expected to finish outstanding budget work and a handful of
policy bills by the end of this week. But they decided Monday to suspend all
legislative action for the next three weeks, returning to work in early
December.

""At some point or another, we have to do our job. But it's very hard to do
when the election isn't settled,"" said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.

The Senate Banking Chairman, who objects to the commodities legislation
being considered in the Senate, didn't rule out anything regarding new
derivatives laws or bankruptcy rules Tuesday. He spoke with reporters after
the Senate GOP's weekly policy lunch.

""There's still a lot here to be done,"" Gramm said, responding to a question
about the commodities bill and possible bankruptcy laws.   ""There are a lot
of things that could happen."" Senate Agriculture Chairman Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., hasn't yet decided whether he will push legislation that merely
extends current commodities laws or press Senate leaders to pass the House
bill that overhauls the laws that oversee the $94 trillion derivatives
industry.

""There are so many things up in the air,"" said Senate Agriculture
spokeswoman Tiffany Steele.

Lugar has said in the past that he could bring up the commodities bill that
passed the House 377-4, over Gramm's objections, and attach it to a federal
spending bill before Congress adjourns for the year.

""That's one of the options being considered,"" Steele said. The House bill
excludes OTC contracts from U.S. commodities laws, eases regulations for
U.S. futures exchanges and lifts the 18-year ban on single-stock futures.

The most recent statistics available placed the total estimated worldwide
notional value of outstanding over-the-counter derivatives contracts at $94
trillion at the end of June, according to the Bank for International
Settlements.

Ag Subcommittee Candidate Raises Eyebrows.
Wall Street Letter - November 13, 2000
By Dan Freed

One of the more interesting possibilities in the forthcoming appointment of
new committee leadership positions in the House of Representatives in the
wake of last week's elections - which has thus far escaped the notice of
many in Washington - involves a subcommittee chairmanship and a crucial
piece of legislation.  A number of committee leadership positions that are
critical to the interests of Wall Street are still considered to be open.

Nick Smith, R-Michigan, was one of only four members of the House of
Representatives who voted against the Commodity Futures Modernization Act
last month. Nevertheless, Smith is in the running to be appointed chairman
of the House Agriculture subcommittee for Risk Management, Research, and
Specialty Crops, which wrote the legislation. If the bill, which would
overhaul commodity trading regulations, doesn't pass Congress this year,
Smith could well find himself responsible for writing the next one.  A
spokesman for Smith did not provide an explanation for the congressman's
vote by press time, and he had no comment on whether Smith would pursue the
subcommittee chairmanship.

One lobbyist could not explain Smith's vote, but suggested that the
congressman didn't have a solid understanding of the issues surrounding the
legislation. ""He's very strange. He attends most of the hearings, but he
zeroes in on things that don't matter to many people - delivery points with
[Chicago Board of Trade] grain contracts. People in the audience snicker
when he asks questions."" The lobbyist conceded, however, that ""[Smith is]
always open to listening to everyone's concerns."" The Smith spokesman did
not return a call requesting a response to these comments.

Another lobbyist was less critical, pointing out that CBOT delivery points
are an important issue for Smith's constituents, as well as others in his
region. The first lobbyist doubted that Smith would get the chairmanship,
and seconded a House staff member's guess that the post would go to Frank
Lucas, it-Oklahoma, who represents both energy and agricultural interests,
giving him ties to the futures and over-the-counter communities. Other
possibilities are John Boehner, it-Ohio, and Terry Everett, R-Alabama.

Full Committee chairmanships said to be still undetermined in the House
include the two principal financial industry oversight committees, Banking
and Commerce.  Marge Roukema, R-New Jersey, has seniority in the Banking
Committee, but Richard Baker, R-Louisiana, is considered a contender.
Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, has also been rumored as a possible Banking chairman,
though he announced his candidacy for the Commerce position last week.  W.J.
""Billy"" Tauzin, R-Louisiana, has also staked a claim to Commerce, and his
battle with Oxley, which has flared up in public on occasion, will be
interesting to watch.  Chairmanship of the House Ways and Means committee
which is responsible for tax issues, is also in question.  Either Philip
Crane, R-Illinois, or William Thomas, R-California could get the nod.

SFE Cleared To Sell In US Markets Digest
Financial Times - November 15, 2000

SFE cleared to sell in US The Sydney Futures Exchange said yesterday it was
now permitted to directly offer its stock futures and options contracts to
US customers.

The exchange said it had obtained authorisation from US regulator, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and its Share Price Index 200 products
were now available to customers globally.

Introduced in May, the SPI 200 futures and options are based on the S&P/ASX
200 index, the new benchmark equity index for Australian markets. SFE's
interest rate and commodity products are already available for trading to
customers worldwide.

Meanwhile, the Australian Derivatives Exchange (ADX) said yesterday it was
confident it would be able to open for business within weeks and a firm
launch date would be announced as soon as possible.

The ADX said it believed it was in the final stages of satisfying the
information and documentation requirements of the Australian Securities and
Investment Commission, which was in the process of assessing the exchange's
market application.

Originally scheduled to be launched on October 20, the ADX had postponed its
launch date to the middle of November, saying more time was required to
complete the regulatory process.

ADX is intended to be a fully electronic derivatives exchange with a global
focus.


Levitt's Options Penny Postulation Too Pricey?
Wall Street Letter - November 13, 2000

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt's recent
suggestion that the Commission may ban trading and quoting of options
contracts in increments larger than a penny has drawn considerable
skepticism from a market data expert, who said that trading options in
pennies would cause a tremendous strain on industry information systems. Leo
McBlain, who chairs the Financial Information Forum, an industry
organization devoted to information systems matters, said that were the
Commission to mandate that options trade in pennies, it could
conceivably cause some firms to choose to abandon the product altogether, if
they determined that the cost of bringing systems up to speed outweighed the
revenue it generated.

During a speech delivered just over a week ago at the Fordham Law School in
New York City, Levitt suggested that the Commission might mandate penny
increments for options, just as it has for stocks.

McBlain explained that one equity stock can generate as many as 60 options
contracts, due to different information about prices and expiration dates.
He noted that options data already accounts for roughly 70% of all market
data generated in North America. Increasing the number of options pricing
possibilities by five or 10 times could generate far more message traffic
than current systems can handle. Updating those systems could be
tremendously costly, he said, though he wasn't aware that any cost estimates
have been made thus far.

John Panchery, who heads the Securities Industry Association's decimals
conversion project, said that industry attention is still focused on
ensuring that it will be able to handle the additional message traffic that
will be generated when Nasdaq converts to decimals in the spring. He said it
was too early to say whether trading options in pennies within a year was an
unrealistic goal, or whether such a mandate from the SEC might cause some
firms to choose not to trade options. An SEC spokeswoman declined to
comment, noting only that Levitt said in his speech that he ""did not
underestimate the technological and regulatory challenges [options] markets
face.""

invitation that will serve as a framework for our discussions.

The dates and locations are as follows:

Wednesday, May 2--London--UBS, 1 Finsbury Avenue
Friday, May 11--New York--AIG, 70 Pine Street
Tuesday, May 15--Tokyo--Royal Park Hotel, hosted by Sanwa Bank.

Each of the lunches is scheduled from 12:00 to 2:00.

I hope that you will, at a minimum, be able to attend the lunch that is
closest to your office. If you cannot attend in either New York or London,
we would be happy to invite someone in your office there who is responsible
for a significant area of the derivatives business. If so, please let me
have their contact details.

The Tokyo luncheon has traditionally focused on issues more specific to the
Tokyo market. Accordingly, with the exception of the chairman and
occasionally other Board members who happen to be in Tokyo at the time, past
attendees at the Tokyo luncheon have been the principal Japanese firms only.
This year, with the strategic planning session starting the next day in
Kyoto, we are hopeful that a number of you will be able to attend the
luncheon. Local Tokyo representatives of firms will not, however, be invited
to the Tokyo luncheon.

Please RSVP to Cynthia Richards to let us know which lunches you will be
attending.

such as zero-coupon bonds, low coupon bonds issued at a discount and
non-discounted bonds that accrete during their term.  ""The Convertibles
Supplement represents the consensus of a diverse range of constituents in
the credit derivatives markets, including portfolio managers, credit

ISDA Debuts Credit Derivatives Number at $631.5 billion in OTC Market Survey
ISDA Press Release - November 9, 2001
<http://www.isda.org/whatsnew/index.html>

NEW YORK, Friday, November 9, 2001 - The International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (ISDA) announced today that the global notional outstanding
volume of credit derivatives transactions was $631.497 billion for the first
half of 2001. While still modest in relation to interest rate products, this
figure is expected to remain on a strong upward trend compared to more
mature derivative product areas.

Polling member firms for the first time on credit derivatives transactions,
ISDA surveyed total notional outstanding volumes for single name credit
default swaps, default swaps on baskets of up to ten credits, and portfolio
transactions of ten credits and more. 83 ISDA member firms supplied data on
these products. Interest rate and currency derivatives growth was 3.573% in
the first half of the year among members that also reported to ISDA at
year-end 2000. For these firms, total notional outstanding volumes increased
from $53.267 trillion to $55.170 trillion. Total notional principle of
interest rate swaps, interest rate options and currency swaps for all
surveyed firms dipped to $57.305 trillion from $63.009 trillion last year.
Among top ten dealers, there was also a minor decrease in volume from
$35.648 trillion to $35.532 trillion.

""Shifting product use is a reflection of a more uncertain global market
environment,"" said Thomas K. Montag, Vice-Chairman of ISDA and Chair of the
Association's Market Survey Committee. ""The market for credit protection has
an obvious appeal during times of economic downturn,"" said Mr Montag, a
Managing Director of Global Interest Rate Products and Asia FICC, and
Co-President of Goldman Sachs (Japan), Ltd.

The survey, which is compiled twice yearly by Andersen LLP, is performed on
a confidential basis. It is complemented by the more comprehensive survey
produced quarterly by the Bank for International Settlements. Of the 83
member institutions providing outstanding notional volumes figures in the
ISDA interest rate and currency derivatives survey, 67 were participants in
the previous semi-annual survey.

707,"Background

The ISO presently uses the SLIC application in that Outage Coordination
operators manually enter outage information gathered from market
participants via fax, e-mail or phone call.  However, during the recent
power crisis, it was determined that several smaller units were actually out
of service simultaneously with other major outages and the lack of
coordination caused serious operational problems that could have been
avoided had the ISO had forehand knowledge of the market participant
requirements.  As a result, Executive Order D-23-01 was created by Governor
Gray Davis to enhance management of the ISO controlled grid by ordering the
ISO to request and coordinate the information of all generating facilities
within the state of California capable of providing 10MW of power or more.

In response to the critical problem at hand, the re-design and development
of a web-interface SLIC application was implemented to address the way the
outage information is collected and processed. This re-design proposes to
automate as much as possible the verification, management and processing of
outage requests and related information, with the objective of reducing
workload and eliminating the generation of errors.


How to Register as a SLIC user:

To connect to the ISO's SLIC system, all Outage Coordinators and Scheduling
Coordinators must first register their company information as well as
identify a person from within their company to act as a primary contact with
the ISO. The primary contact will be responsible for identifying personnel
from within their company who will be using SLIC and will require digital
certificates.

To register, please do the following:

* Complete and return the attached forms to the ISO (refer to return
address on page 2)

* Upon receipt and verification of this form, the ISO will forward a
Digital Certificate Request Form to the primary contact person identified
from within your company.

* The primary contact will then complete, and e-mail, the Digital
Certificate Request Form back to the ISO, identifying the personnel from
within their company requiring digital certificates.

* The ISO will process the requested Digital Certificates within 10
working days and Fed Ex them, along with the instructions for their use, to
the primary contact in your company.  Detailed instructions on using the
SLIC application will also be included in this mailing.


Full documentation for the program is being developed. The documentation
will include an implementation plan and user instructions. It is highly
important that we begin the security process as a soon as possible. Please
complete and return the forms by cob Friday, March 23,2001.

Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.

762,"The purpose of this note is to update you on travel related to the recruiting efforts of the Program.
 Over the weekend, President Bush asked all Americans to resume their activities, but to do so with the heightened awareness that the country is now at war with terrorists and with any country that supports their activities.  Enron's current position is that employees should avoid all non-essential business travel.  With these things in mind, and for the safety of our employees, I very strongly encourage you to consider alternatives to business travel for recruiting activities.  
 Earlier this year, we made the decision to emphasize real-time and direct recruiting methods, which by their design require less time and presence on campus.  I would now ask that each executive lead and recruiter carefully review their campus schedule / strategy and consider modifications.  Technology has given us the opportunity to use tools like video conferencing, telephone interviews, email, and CD based resume books.  The focusing benefits of these tools can significantly decrease the number of people required for on-campus presentations and interviews, and in some cases may even eliminate the need for these activities.  In addition to the primary concern of safety, a major disruption to the travel grid like that which occurred last week could strand critical Enron business personnel in relatively remote locations.
 Later this week we will make a decision regarding participation in the National Black MBA Conference in Orlando, Florida.

The Enron Corp.

The Policy includes a three page Executive Summary providing an overview of risk management practices for the four major types of risks addressed: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk, and this summary is attached to this e-mail for your convenience.  The credit policy was incorporated without change, and the Transaction Approval Process and Guarantee Approval Processes were also incorporated with updating for specific approval authorities. 

This e-mail message is being sent to the Enron Management Committee to highlight some key aspects of the Company's market risk management practices which may be of interest.  

The Policy established a new Risk Management Committee, members of which are the Chief Risk Officer and any others designated by the CEO of Enron Corp.  During this transition period, existing Commodity Group Limits as of August 14th remain in effect, and Enron Business Unit Limits are assigned accordingly.  These limits may be further adjusted by the Risk Management Committee and the CEO, and your market risk managers will be working with you to review the limit structure for your business unit's activities to facilitate compliance with the Policy and your business initiatives.  RAC is currently working with Global Risk Management Operations to develop appropriate risk reporting that meets the Policy requirements and the needs of business unit management.

All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.

INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom

reasonable offer at $60.   TLR's prevented any new schedules from being

After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our 
final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows:
We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts 
with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following 
the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for 
the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and 
default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights.
For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs 
covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4 
quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:

Input snapshots           Performance
1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end   12 
month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 2000
1999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end    12 month 
end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 2000
1999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end     12 month end 
performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 2000
1998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end    12 
month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000

We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the 
performance period.  Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+ 
days delinquency on any trade credit.
We have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big 
picture, it makes sense to spend  the extra amount to get the right data for 
analysis.
Please let me know your thoughts.  This will require D&B to give us a 
modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly.

Title: Iran: Conservatives Fighting Hard Against the Tide

***********************************************************************

IRAN'S POLITICAL MAP AND IMPLICATIONS FOR INVESTORS

Reading Iran's political map--always complex--is more so now because of the
contradictory nature of the short-term and long-term trends. The short term
offers tension and setbacks to the pro-reform elements. The long term offers
the potential for genuine change in the Iranian political scene.

*  Political tension is the result of Iran's peculiar and essentially unstable
power structure.

*  Despite the setbacks dealt to the reformist agenda defended by the Iranian
president, the conservatives are fighting against the tide.

*  In the short term the political tensions might delay the signing of some
contracts in the oil and gas sector and postpone foreign investment.

I change the storage model output to its total value versus the unit value 
before.
The total value refers to the total present value of the storage capacity at 
given
status (initial conditions).

The way I calculate the unit value is 

(Total PV - S*capacity taken)/total capacity

which could suffer some negative numbers since S, the spot price could be
very high.  The correct way is to define the S as the average injection gas 
price, but
 this would be troublesome to compute.

By switching to total PV, the delta can be interpreted as total commodity 
delta for the
hedge.  Actually, Duffie also suggested using the total PV as the output in 
his audit
review.

I have attached the XLL model below.

FEA has arrived at a very simple, direct, and inexpensive approach to
licensing our two VaR-related patents as a package.  I hope that you will
agree that our proposed license fee of $2,500 plus $1 per employee, with
licenses to go to all of your affiliates, would be an attractive offer.  I
would love to sign up Enron for this package as an early customer.  Do you
think you could forward the attached pdf license agreement to the

Enron wants to participate this deal by offer Promigas loan guarantee in 
exchange of call options
on 50% Promigas equity in TVCable.

Following suggestions have been made:

1) get a market quote for the loan guarantee;
    use credit risk model to price the guarantee internally;
    need to speak to Vasant

2) find a comparable company, study the volatility
    using company value histogram from economics model(crystal ball output), 
I can fit a lognormal
    distribution, then find the volatility

3)calcalte the call option value, find braek-even strike.


Any inputs are extremely welcome.

Also, after having a discussion with Andreas here in London we should 
probably reduce the vol we are using for TC - we are taking the Cu price 
vol as a proxy which is a too high. However, assuming the the other 
assumptions we have made around the TC ( ie simulating a parallel shift in 
the curve and 
including no term structure to the price curve) the vol estimate is a 
conservative one.

   A Study of the Enron Project 

   * Publishers: Orient Longman, New Delhi * Price: Rs. 195

   THE Enron power project at Dabhol in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra has 
been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the
   inception of the project proposal in 1992; and the sordid tale ends only 
in 1997, with the Supreme Court of India refusing to even
   admit an appeal against the Bombay High Court decision, of December 1996, 
which while commenting that ""This case has
   highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of Independence, 
political considerations outweigh the public interest and
   the interest of the State and to what extent the Government can go to 
justify its actions not only before the public but even before
   the courts of law"" - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the 
project on the (purely technical) ground of res judicata, even
   though new facts, new arguments, new evidence of the violation of the laws 
of the land had been advanced by the petitioners.

   The fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and 
recorded, despite the petitioners adducing the required
   evidence, can only be termed as strange, perhaps bizarre.

   Abhay Mehta's simple, factual documentation - in fact a chronological 
narration - of all events, including the process of bending all
   rules, of subverting the law for promoting a project involving 
unparalleled future liabilities for Maharashtra, indeed for the whole of
   India - is not only masterly, it is devastating.

   It is a short, pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by 
all thinking citizens of this country. Barring the
   concluding chapter, the epilogue, there are no personal comments, only 
facts, disseminated from the original papers, mostly 'secret'
   documents.

   All documentation has been carefully, faithfully recorded, including 
extracts from supposedly 'top secret' minutes of cabinet
   committee meetings; and the specific violations of the law (which were 
opposed by a few public spirited civil servants, much to
   their disadvantage) have been pointed up. Apart from an introductory 
'Primer on Electricity' - introduced for the benefit of the
   layman, explaining some technical issues relating to electricity 
generation, transmission and distribution - and the background of the
   events of 1991, the foreign exchange crisis, and the aftermath of the 
crisis, the other fifteen chapters, three appendices and fourteen
   annexes of the small book (of 226 pages) packs in an enormous volume of 
factual information. The strange saga of the Enron
   project, and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single 
project poses for the country, need to be briefly recounted
   here, for essentially, it is the coming generation which would have to 
face the problem.

   The MSEB has contracted to buy - and if not used, to pay for - 2000 MW of 
electricity (for a period of 20 years) from the
   Dabhol Power Company (the legal entity set up by Enron, as an unlimited 
liability company registered in India, through a maze of
   intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more 'front' 
companies registered in various tax-free havens.

   Abhay Mehta has indicated the total payments to Enron over 20 years amount 
to $ 35 billion (at 1998 exchange rates, around Rs.
   1,25,000 crores) over the life of the project. One must record that: (a) 
crude oil/oil product prices have as of writing, more than
   doubled since the above calculations were made. A per the 'doctored' 
figures presented by the company (and its advocate), the
   charge per unit of electricity supplied, at the 1998 level of prices, was 
to 4.39 cent (per unit) as 'capacity charge' and 3.43 cents
   (per unit) for 'energy costs'.

   The former is indexed to the US inflation rate, and the latter to 
international fuel prices. The former may be assumed to have gone
   up only marginally (rounded to 4.4 cents per unit); we know that fuel 
prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999.
   Assuming the 'fuel costs' to have increased less than 100 per cent - even 
though international prices have more than doubled - we
   may assume (for 1999) energy costs of 6.85 cents per units, making for a 
total payment of 11.25 US cents per unit of electricity
   supplied by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to MSEB in late 1999, in Phase 
I of the project.

   Within another two years, at 2000 MW, the annual offtake (for 365 days X 
24 hours/day) would be 17.52 billion KWH; and at
   11.25 cents per unit, the total payment amounts to $1.97 billion annually; 
for 20 years, this workout to $ 39.4 billion.

   This is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or 
capacity charge. At today's exchange rate - about Rs.43.5 per US
   dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than Rs. 175,000 crores (as 
compared to Rs. 125,000 crores indicated by Abhay
   Mehta). This is the cost to MSEB in rupee; and to the country in foreign 
exchange as payment to just one project authority, for
   supply of part of the power required in Maharashtra.

   The really significant point to note in this connection is that this 
payment - and considerably more, depending on (a) future increase
   in'capacity charges' depending on US inflation rate, and international 
prices of LNGaphtha (for 'fuel costs'), and (b) depreciation of
   the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis the US dollar - is obligatory; 
the assets of the MSEB, the Maharashtra government
   indeed, all assets of the Government of India (present and future) are 
mortgaged to Enron, by way of sovereign guarantees
   extended by both governments.

   The other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by 
all independent Indian experts as well as the World Bank -the
   Enron project he forced the MSEB to cut its offtake of Tata Electric 
Company's and its own much cheaper thermal power
   already; in a postscript dated August 1999, Abhay Mehta has indicated that 
already, the MSEB had stopped buying between 200
   and 250 MW of power from Tata Electric (available at Rs. 1.80 per unit) 
and has had to backdown its own Chandrapur thermal
   power station (cost of this power being Rs. 1.20 per unit), while forced 
to buy more expensive Enron power at Rs. 5 per unit.

   The loss to MSEB on this count alone comes to Rs. 460 crore per year.

   This had in fact, been predicted earlier even by the World Bank.

   It is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was 
contrived, by a deliberate campaign of 'disinformation', of
   blatant lies, of sidelining of expert opinion, not only of independent 
experts but also the GOI's own official advisers in this matter,
   namely, the Central Electricity Authority as well as that of the World 
Bank, which was resolutely opposed to this project. The
   detailed facts, the letters exchanged in the above context, the pressure 
tactics adopted, the flouting of all procedures norms, even
   statutory provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, are all carefully 
documented by Abhay Mehta.

   Mehta correctly concludes: ""We frequently blame external agencies - like 
the World Bank - for all our problems, when, as a
   matter of fact, we ourselves are our own worst enemies. In the instant 
case, the World Bank not only advised the Government of
   India against the project, it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of 
the total inadvisability of this project. In fact, one must note
   here that in 1996, neighbouring Pakistan, which had entered into a 
somewhat similar MoU with Enron, cancelled the project (and
   the Power Purchase Agreement with Enron), for a $ 670 million, 782 MW 
residual oil-fuelled power plant, even though that
   Agreement had stipulated Enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6.4 US 
cents per KWH over a 30 year period. (Note the
   estimated rate of 11.25 cents per KWH for Dabhol power for the MSEB in 
December 1999, which works out to around Rs. 5
   per unit).

   One could go on; but one must leave the reader to go through Abhay Mehta's 
crisp, factual, matter of fact narration of the Enron
   saga, and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the 
story, about 'The Next Round of Scams'.

   For quite some time, the ruling elite in India has been intent on 
'privatising' all public enterprises; and even 'utilities' are no
   exception. The 'unbundling' of infrastructure with a view to privatisation 
of all the 'profitable' segments. All this - as per the current
   'disinformation campaign' - is supposedly in the interest of 
rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply.

   The author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the 
Government - by the Torrent Group - of the Ahmedabad and
   Surat Electricity companies at less than one-tenth of the market value of 
the assets of thee facilities. Again, much like the Enron
   saga, all objections by the Finance Department of the Gujarat government 
were overruled.

   And, Abhay Mehta has predicated that this onslaught - the break-up of 
power utilities into three segments, generation, transmission
   and distribution, - with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the 
new thrust by the ruling elite, for reasons that do not require to
   be spelt out.

   Though Mehta had the examples of the Torrent Group takeover of Ahmedabad 
and Surat Electricity companies, and of the break
   up of the Orissa State Electricity Board before him, yet his statement can 
be stated today to be prophetic; the UPSEB is now on
   the firing line. The recent strike by the workers and engineers of the 
UPSEB in protest of the announced UP government decision
   to trifurcate the UPSEB; and the Union Minister of Power, Mr. Rangarajan 
Kumaramangalam's statement that the UPSEB is a
   loss making, inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities 
after the trifurcation - need to be noted.

   That 40 per cent of the dues of the UPSEB are from the UP Government; that 
tariffs for UP electricity supply are fixed by the UP
   government and not by the UPSEB; that the UPSEB does not have the cash 
even for routine maintenance as a result of the above
   - these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider. That the 
remedy for UPSEB lies in a different kind of reform and
   restructuring, is not even to be debated. The whole idea is to privatise 
the profitable segments, and to leave the public sector entity
   with all the problem areas, including rural energy supply. It is against 
this background that Abhay Mehta's book needs to be widely
   disseminated, read, and its implications understood.

   What is at stake is not a 'utility' here or a PSU there. What is at stake 
is the future of some 80 per cent of the have-nots in this
   country.

   What is at stake is the 'pillory' of the assets of the nation for private 
aggrandisement.

926,"Please find attached the code for the HJM simulation model for option pricing and other necessities.
The model takes as inputs prices and volatilities and generates a daily spot price grid and respective transition probabilities - a framework for pricing options of multiple kinds.
As it is, the model seems quite flexible and detailed. It takes care of fwd-fwd volatilities and uses different factor loadings for each month - this means that the model takes different PCAs as as the curve shrinks in time. Also, the user may define as many factors as the size of # of points in the fwd curve.
One interesting aspect is the way I evolved the spot price to provide convergence to the prompt month price as the month approaches its end. Before shocking prices (spot and fwds) I get the expected spot for the next day by linear interpolation with the prompt fwd. By ensuring convergence, however, the model creates a spot price vol that converges to the prompt month vol. The phenomena is illustrated in the spreadsheet example where I call the model for each day of the first month to calculate the respective daily expected prices and vols.
As usual, I put the whole project on o:\research\common\project\options\HJM. It is self-contained - no need for other files and the whole source code is there. To see the the spreadsheet you need to install the fwd-fwd vol function and the loading factor function. You will find these things on o:\research\custom. Note that this is not necessary to run the model itself. It just makes the spreadsheet more illustrative and the code more understandable.
Regarding the last, I tried as much as possible to make the code clear and lean hoping that you feel confortable with its pieces and usability.


         
These are the files:
	HJMsim.c - Main file
	HJM.c - Where the simulation is actully run
	Support.c - set of support functions for the simulation (fwd-fwd, PCA, etc...)
	NRC.c - set of NRC functions I used (changed variables from float to double)
	NRUTIL.c - modified to accomodate memory management of double tensors

I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.

I was under the impression I sent you a message regarding Brad Romine but
I cannot find a copy in my msg folder. There might have been a glitch in the

I wanted to make the following points:

1. Brad will not show up on March 15. He is still working on his dot-com 
business and wants to
pursue this opportunity.

2. My recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand. Either Brad 
or a stipend
refund check should show up on March 15.

3. I told Brad that  a failure to show up on March 15 will not imperil his 
future employment opportunities
with Enron. We just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource 
needs. If he decides to re-apply
at some point in the future, we shall not hold his  decision  to pursue him

                    mix reshaping energy market: Purchase of MG only a start 
in building
                    B2B platforms, writes Hillary Durgin:
                    99% match; Financial Times ; 16-Jun-2000 12:00:00 am ; 
604 words
                    By HILLARY DURGIN

                    If Jeffrey Skilling is right, 

                    Enron's acquisition of MG is only the tip of the iceberg. 
Enron's president and
                    chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental 
strategy shift at the
                    Houston energy company, aimed at making it a dominant 
""new economy""
                    player across various industrial markets. 

                    The Dollars 446m acquisition last month of MG, the 
UK-based metals trader,
                    is only the first of more than Dollars 1bn in estimated 
new investments the
                    company is targeting. It is seeking vehicles on which to 
build
                    business-to-business (B2B) platforms in sectors such as 
logistics, chemicals,
                    agricultural products and pulp & paper. 

                    Mr Skilling wants to take the business model the company 
developed in
                    natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale 
commodity markets. He
                    argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only 
become the principal
                    B2B sites for those sectors, but reshape those 
industries. 

                    As an example, he points to Enron's new e-commerce 
platform, EnronOnline,
                    which has changed the way the company does business with 
its customers
                    while significantly increasing sales. 

                    The company - the largest wholesale merchant of natural 
gas and power - saw
                    wholesale, physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53 
per cent in the first
                    quarter. 

                    Critics argue that Enron's move away from its familiar 
energy business into
                    new industries, where the learning curve is steep and the 
competition
                    entrenched, is risky. Yet a number of industry analysts 
point out Enron has
                    proved it understands markets and how to manage risks 
while becoming the
                    largest importer of coal in the UK, the largest trader of 
gas and power in the
                    US and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth. 

                    ""It's a prudent strategy, but it's got to be done in an 
orderly way,"" says Ronald
                    Barone, analyst with Paine-Webber in New York. ""What 
they're doing here is
                    what they've been incredibly successful at doing,"" he 
adds, noting that Enron
                    posted Dollars 1.3bn in earnings before interest and 
taxes (ebit) from its
                    wholesale energy and services business in 1999, up 34 per 
cent from the
                    previous year. 

                    Earnings from that division accounted for two-thirds of 
the company's overall
                    income before interest and taxes last year, and Mr Barone 
sees the unit's ebit
                    increasing 15-30 per cent annually over several years. 

                    As with gas and power and now broadband, where Enron is 
standardising
                    contracts and creating a market in bandwidth, it wants to 
create markets by
                    entering as a physical player and providing merchant, 
risk management and
                    financial services over the internet. 

                    ""We will provide electronic commerce, but we will provide 
liquidity and we will
                    provide settlement, or fulfilment of that contract,"" Mr 
Skilling says. ""That is an
                    extremely powerful model. If you look at other B2B sites, 
they don't do that."" 

                    Mr Skilling argues Enron's e-commerce platform will 
triumph over the other,
                    bulletin board-type exchanges, where striking a deal 
depends on two parties
                    hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing, 
price, credit and
                    fulfilment. 

                    Not everyone shares that view. Some energy companies, for 
example, would
                    rather not do business with a competitor. BP Amoco 
recently purchased a 3
                    per cent stake in Altra Energy Technologies, a Houston- 
based, neutral
                    wholesale energy exchange. With Koch Industries and 
American Electric
                    Power, it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of 
transactions on the
                    site to lend it liquidity. 

                    Just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals, 
Enron believes it
                    needs networks of strategic physical assets. In acquiring 
MG, Enron got a
                    stable of warehouses, lending it a strong physical 
position. 

                    ""It should provide (MG) with a more vibrant, more active 
physical spot market
                    in more markets in the world,"" says Greg Whalley, chief 
executive officer of
                    Enron Net Works, the new division Enron is launching to 
identify and enter
                    commodity markets. He argues that in metals and other 
markets, Enron will
                    deliver better pricing, price risk management services, 
cross-commodity
                    transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range 
of customers. 

                    Mr Skilling says there are significant rewards for 
restructuring an industry. 

                    ""If you can take that platform, and you use the 
capabilities the bricks bring to
                    the table, e-commerce the industry and change the 
structure, you're selling for
                    more than a 50 multiple.""

CONFERENCE THEMES & OBJECTIVES

E-Commerce is heading inextricably and rapidly toward an inevitable
shakeout and consolidation that tends to characterize every major new
industry.  This impact conference bringstogether a distinguished group of
industry and academic leaders to discuss what is required to survive the
E-Commerce shakeout, and what it takes to be a ""winner"" when the shakeout
hits, full-force.

Shakeouts are spawned in the boom-and-bust environment of hot emerging
markets.  An unsustainable glut of competitors is attacted by the
contagious enthusiasm for the emerging technology.  As competition
intensifies and falling prices put pressure on margins there is a wave of
ailures and mergers that removes the weaker players.

974,"California warns of possibility of rolling blackouts 
STEVE LAWRENCE, Associated Press Writer
Wednesday,?December 13, 2000 
,2000 Associated Press 
(12-13) 14:50 PST SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson ordered Northwest generators to sell electricity to California 
utilities Wednesday after state regulators warned that low power supplies 
could force rolling blackouts. 
The warning came from the Independent System Operator, keeper of California's 
power grid. It said that electricity supplies were so perilously low that it 
might declare a Stage 3 power emergency for only the second time ever. At 
Stage 3, the grid can impose blackouts. 
Richardson said at a Washington, D.C., news conference he was using emergency 
powers to force wholesalers to sell power to California at a price he deemed 
fair. He said he would also request that two large Pacific Northwest power 
generating associations send more power to California. 
``Our objective is to keep the lights on in California through this emergency 
situation,'' he said. ``We're dealing with a potentially very serious 
situation here.'' 
California has been caught in a power crunch over the past several days, in 
part because of cold weather in the Northwest -- where California buys much 
of its power -- and the shutdown of some generating plants for maintenance. 
California's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern 
California Edison, are near bankruptcy due to skyrocketing wholesale power 
costs, Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said at a 
Washington, D.C., news conference with Richardson. 
Davis and Feinstein asked federal regulators to set a regional price cap on 
wholesale electricity to prevent the high prices that have plagued 
California. On Friday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission lifted price 
caps in California. 
Record wholesale power prices followed, and PG&E warned it was in financial 
danger. 
The problem became especially acute when about a dozen suppliers began 
demanding cash before selling power to California, Kellan Fluckiger, the 
ISO's chief operating officer, said Wednesday. 
``The credit limits of utilities and what markets are willing to sell us have 
been reached and surpassed in many cases,'' Fluckiger said. ``There are 
questions about utility solvency. That has come to a head today.'' 
He said officials may have to interrupt power to as many as 4 million 
customers Wednesday afternoon and early evening, when people come home from 
work and power demand hits a peak. 
An unprecedented Stage 3 emergency was issued last Thursday, meaning reserves 
had fallen below 1.5 percent. But the state fended off rolling outages by 
turning off two power-sucking water pumps. 
This time, Fluckiger said any blackouts would probably last about an hour to 
90 minutes and occur mostly in Northern California. 
``It's a fairly bleak picture,'' he said. ``This thing will not change unless 
something is done to alleviate the credit situation.'' 
A Stage 1 alert was declared Wednesday morning, meaning power reserves were 
below 7 percent and all power users are asked to conserve. 
Stage 1 and Stage 2 emergencies, in which power reserves fall below 5 percent 
and large commercial customers can be forced to shut down, have become 
routine this month, but last Thursday's Stage 3 was the only time the threat 
of blackouts loomed. 
Contributing to the problem is a shortage of water to power hydroelectric 
generators in the Northwest and California, Fluckiger said. 
``We have reservoirs so low that we have people standing by them watching the 
situation to make sure it does not go below safe limits,'' he said. 
The power crunch over the past few months has been blamed in part on 
electricity deregulation. California approved a phased-in deregulation of the 
electricity market in 1996 to try to lower prices for consumers through 
competition, but so far it has led to higher energy prices. 
At the same time, wholesale power costs have been soaring, in large part 
because of skyrocketing prices for natural gas. Wall Street is worried about 
utilities' financial health, and on Tuesday, a consumer group urged the state 
to seize and run the strapped $20 billion electricity system.

977,"Below are details of new plan currently being created by California State 
Treasurer Phil Angelides and supported by Sen. Burton.  The plan is in the 
initial stages and is not currently on any legislative fast-track.  It is 
also not motivated by a desire to save SoCal from bankruptcy.  The creator's 
goal is to give Californians more control over their energy and electric 
futures as well as giving the tax/rate payers a share of the pie in return 
for money that has/will go to the utilities.  We will continue to monitor 
this plan, its supporters and progress.

Plan Z
  California State Treasurer Phil Angelides and a powerful group of 
legislators are finally taking action and are developing a plan to solve 
California's energy crisis this summer.  The group is comprised of leftish 
legislators, environmental advocates, in-state energy company executives and 
business leaders and they are pulling together a Plan Z.  At the core of the 
plan is the recently passed authorization to erect a California Public Power 
Authority that issues bonds, constructs new power plants and buys up 
transmission lines.  There is even talk within this group of using newly 
legislated authority to buy SoCal Edison for $3.5 billion (less than it owes) 
although they would face huge obstacles and receive strong opposition from 
power companies as well as Edison itself.
  The five-year goal is to have enough power generation capacity to guarantee 
a 5%-15% ""cushion"" against energy peak demand.  Angelides and Burton want to 
create enough capacity to form a buyer's market.  One of the points of the 
plan is to replace private sector generation with more public sector 
generation.  This plan may short-circuit private sector plans to build new 
plants, but the state has the ability to issue $5B in revenue-backed bonds 
(in addition to the $12B rate-backed bonds).    The second key element in the 
Angelides-Burton Plan Z is additional rate hikes for California's consumers 
and businesses.  Although discussions are still underway between this group 
and business leaders, Angelides is wanting to propose an additional 45% 
increase in residential and commercial electricity rates, however, there is 
immense sympathy for loading a disproportionate share of the burden on 
businesses.   This increase is on top of the 50%-60% already mandated by 
previous PUC decisions this year.  These rate increases will do two things: 
stop the immediate fiscal drain on the state of California and prevent 
emergency tax hikes (being serious considered last week).  
  Issues to consider in regards to this plan are: (1) how much will current 
shareholders be diluted in return for helping the utilities repay long-owed 
debts (or what would they get if the state decided to buy up all of SoCal 
Edison); and (2) how much will creditors have to ""eat"" in the legislated 
repayment plan?   In other words how big will the equity and bond haircuts 
be?  There is no answer to these questions right now as legislators work to 
cobble together a plan with numbers that work without triggering a massive 
and politically destructive rebellion by voters next year.",Phil Angelides Burton Angelides 50%-60,$3.5 billion 5B,SoCal SoCal Edison Edison Angelides-Burton Plan Z PUC
978,"Jeff and I met with Troy Blakney this morning - he has agreed to join the 
selection committee. We plan to meet tomorrow with Red Duke (lunch) and Roel 
Campos (breakfast). Jeff has spoken with Gerald Smith and he has also agreed 
to join the committee. 

In terms of an action plan:
Once we have finalized the committee members, I will schedule a meeting 
(preferably before the Febr. 1 scheduled news conference) with all members to 
offer them an opportunity to meet one another and discuss how we will proceed.
Next, I will begin scheduling meetings with some key people that  would 
provide the committee with important insight into the key issues facing the 
HFD. Jeff suggested possibly blocking out an entire day where the committee 
members would speak to these individuals back to back in 1 or 2 hour time 
slots.
Then, a full day will be blocked out where the committee members will 
interview the approximate 10 identified candidates.
The committee will then meet (half a day?) to narrow the list of 10 down to 3.
The three final candidates will be presented to the Mayor.

flexibility in considering control options other than SCR when determining 
the control requirements.

TNRCC Comments on Houston Non-attainment Regulations - Marc Phillips is 
preparing Enron's comments to TNRCC regarding their proposed regulations for 
the Houston Non-attainment area. Enron will be supporting the Business 
Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) comments, but will have additional comments on

will be circulated on Friday for submittal on Monday.

TNRCC Inspection of Mont Belvieu facility - Marc Phillips assisted plant 
personnel with a TNRCC air inspection of the Mont Belvieu underground storage 
facility.

Greenhouse Gas Emission Credits - Marc Phillips has been discussing a 
possible trade with Indaco, a company that surveys gas pipeline compressor 
stations for methane leaks. Indaco will perform a survey at a station in 
Kansas in return for greenhouse gas emission credits. He has been talking to 
Enron traders to determine the value of a greenhouse gas credit.

Enron Day of Caring - Russell Tucker provided employee safety oversight 
during the Enron Day of Caring activities at the Depelchan Children's Center. 
Safety concerns encountered ranged from the intended use of Benzene

recommend it. Linda Adels continues to work with EDS to get the CBT program 
installed and the workstation assessment available on the Internet for the 
Enron Building participants. EDS is requiring a security request be made for 
each person to load  the CD-ROM's and updating of the Internet browser on all 
the involved computers. None of these problems would be present with these 
programs installed and run from the Enron Intranet, which is the intended 
method should the program be adopted for global use. 

Environmental Notice on Corps of Engineers Revisions - Jim Peterson is 
preparing an Environmental Notice on the Corps of Engineers revisions to the 
nation-wide permit regulations.

visits, audits and action plans , contractor reviews were discussed  and 
agreed upon.

Cuiaba II - Joe Kolb  reports that OPIC release of funding for Cuiaba I is 
now the end of September.  This means that work on the compressor stations 
will not begin in earnest until then.  I expect to view proposed and 
alternate compressor station locations during next visit to area now expected 
to be in late October.  Edgar Zuleta (Corp EH&S) in Bolivia is providing 
valuable assistance in coordinating trip plans.

BMPs - Joe Kolb is waiting for a response from Norm Spalding (EE&CC) whom 
Jerry Martin assigned the proposed pipeline BMPs for review.  A message has 
been left with Norm.  A response was promised by the end of last week.   Bill 
Osborne (GPG) received feedback from Steenberg and Shafer in GPG.  All 
comments helpful and none propose significant changes to document.  Bill 
Osborne has sent BMPs to others within GPG.  GPG reorg may delay responses.  
Wilson Dietrich (Enron Broad Band) has indicated that he will be the proper 
person to review fiber optic BMPs.  The consultant is proceeding with work on 
the electric transmission and fiber optic BMPs.  Wilson will be sent draft as 
soon as it is received.

Project Dolphin - Joe Kolb met with Michael Johns (contact employee of EE&CC) 
to discuss status of environmental component of this middle eastern pipeline 
project.  Things are moving slowly.  An RFP has been sent out and responses 
from 7 environmental consulting firms  are being reviewed.  The RFP is for 
the EIA and EIA field work.  They expect to choose a consultant in about 2 
weeks.  Field work is expected to begin after the first of the year.  The 
project has been scaled back.

World Resources Institute Conference - Susan Worthen represented Enron at the 
WRI Conference in Washington, D.C., which featured panel discussions on a 
number of environmental and social issues facing corporations.  Besides 
corporate representatives, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, The Nature 
Conservancy, Habitat for Animals, World Wildlife Fund, Conservation 
International and the NRDC.  Many recognized and applauded Enron for its 
first appearance and partication.  There may be potential interest in working 
with WRI on future projects.

Environmental Policy Center - We have subscribed to a trial subscription of  
EPC's environmental and safety regulatory and legislative monitoring service 
for Brazil and U.K. and have received the first electronic report.  We are 
now awaiting feedback from regional reviewers to determine if there is 
anything we would like to enhance or change prior to signing an agreement for 
continued and expanded service.  This service will allow the Reg/Leg, 
Environmental Strategies, and regional EHS personnel to track pending and 
proposed legislation in other countries.

relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the

1019,"Folks -- 

Had a good discussion with a Senior Staff member at FERC in preparation for 
the Pipelines Outreach meeting next week.  He told me that the two issues on 
the gas side that are of primary concern to the Commission are 1) Marketing 
Affiliates and potential abuse on the pipelines (Think El Paso); and 2) the 
failure of CFTC and/or SEC to more closely oversee derivative trading. 

Apparently, staff is considering whether to ban all transactions by marketers 
on an affiliated pipeline, and some form of filing/reporting requirement to 
better understand the derivative market.  Due to a lack of information, some 
at FERC are assuming the worst.    

I believe these proposals are in the formative stage and have not been 
presented to Senior Staff or Commissioners as a recommendation.  I think 
Staff would appreciate some information (ammo) to refute the need to further 
regulate marketing affiliates or delve into derivative trading.

INGAA filed comments and a study concerning Marketers' use of affiliated 
pipelines in response to the Marketing Affiliate Conference at FERC.  These 
are attached.   Staff questions whether the underlying information remains 
accurate.  We are considering whether to update the underlying information 
used in the INGAA Study and how best to address these issues (probably during 
Q&As) during the Staff Outreach.

I believe it would be helpful to put back together the coalition that Leslie 
Lawner used at the last Market Affiliate conference to request a meeting as 
part of the current Staff Outreach to discuss Staff's concerns.  In addition, 
I think it would be helpful to request a separate ENRON meeting with Staff to 
discuss how the derivative market works and why FERC does not need to 
establish ongoing reporting requirements or otherwise become involved in 
these markets.  Unfortunately, in this meeting we would probably be asked 
about our involvement in the El Paso Merchant Transportation deal into 
California, in light of Peggy Hegg's comment on the Frontline Show that El 
Paso hedged some of the risk with Enron.  

We can discuss further on Friday's call.  Later Joe

8 State Power Contracts Seen as Bad Deals
Energy: The long-term pacts require the purchase of too much electricity at too high a price for too long, a study finds. Immediate renegotiation is urged.
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL
Times Staff Writers

September 30 2001

SACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated, according to a new, detailed study. 

The biggest problems are so-called ""take or pay"" clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it, the study said. 

The contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price, according to the analysis, which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer, environmental and renewable energy groups. 

Between January and September, the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities, which have been unable to buy power on their own. The longest of the contracts would last 20 years, and overall, the pacts are estimated to cost $43 billion over the next two decades. 

Power generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts, but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state. 

""If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts, we will consider it,"" said Joe Ronan, a senior vice president for San Jose-based Calpine Corp. But, he said, the company has ""no intention of asking for renegotiation"" on its own. 

Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association for electricity generating companies, said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation. So far, he said, ""I don't see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction."" 

And he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table. ""We'd take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations,"" he said. 

For his part, Gov. Gray Davis would be open to renegotiations, said his spokesman, Steve Maviglio, but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table. 

""Would we love to get a better deal?"" Maviglio said. ""Of course we would, but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now, and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts, we'd be the first ones at the table."" 

S. David Freeman, who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state, said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements. When the state began negotiating contracts, California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts. The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat, he said. 

""Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit,"" said Freeman, ""but it's a good thing to have."" 

But William B. Marcus, chief economist for JBS Energy, which conducted the three-month study, noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined. 

The study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a $200,000 grant from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation. It was conducted by JBS, a consulting group. 

The study singled out for criticism: 

* A deal with Sempra Energy, parent company to San Diego Gas & Electric, which Marcus called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts. Over the life of the pact, he calculated, Sempra would earn $1.2 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost. 

The contract lasts until 2011. For each year, it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether it's needed or not. 

* A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co. that have yet to be built. The plants will be ""peakers,"" designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight, such as on hot summer afternoons. The state agreed to pay Calpine $90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity. 

""They get $90 million a year on plants that cost $250 million,"" said Marcus. ""That's huge. You get your money out in three years. If a utility had built these power plants, they would have charged half as much."" 

* A deal with Alliance-Colton LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County. The deal commits the state to pay $207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity. 

* An agreement to pay $150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp. of Atlanta owns in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

* A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp, a private utility based in Portland, Ore. Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of $70 per megawatt-hour. That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winter's crisis, but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed. 

* Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants. The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts, the study said. 

One of the marketers, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., agreed to sell from 150 to 1,000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight $61 per megawatt-hour. 

But a second marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for $62.50 to $87 per megawatt-hour. 

""When you compare those two contracts,"" Marcus said, ""you know you've got a dog here. I think Williams showed up earlier, and the state was desperate."" 

* An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of Houston that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, Marcus said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go. 

* A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

Marcus, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer. 

Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices. 

""The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty,"" said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. ""To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas."" 

When the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire. 

Marcus was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring. 

Another weakness of the contracts, Marcus said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said. 

Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added. 

""I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy,"" Marcus said. 

""I don't want to pay Williams $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin.""

NEGOTIATIONS HIT SNAG: PG&E, Edison want end to price freeze if they sell 
transmission lines to state David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, March 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/21/M
N114450.DTL 
California's near-bankrupt utilities are demanding that higher electric rates 
be a part of any deal to sell the state their power lines, The Chronicle has 
learned. 
A rate increase -- perhaps of more than 50 percent, according to earlier 
industry estimates -- would certainly draw a firestorm of protest from 
consumer groups and force Gov. Gray Davis to backtrack from earlier pledges 
that rates would remain unchanged. 
Nevertheless, sources close to negotiations on the deal said Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison are attempting to make higher 
rates a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell 
the state their transmission systems and some land. 
The sources said the talks hit a new snag this week when state officials 
realized that fine print sought by the companies could require the Public 
Utilities Commission to pass along all of the utilities' costs to ratepayers. 
The sources said this would end a rate freeze that shields consumers from 
runaway wholesale electricity prices. 
The inclusion of potential rate increases in the talks reflects the growing 
complexity of a deal originally intended by Davis to stabilize the finances 
of PG&E and Edison so banks would resume loans to the cash-strapped 
utilities. 
The negotiations subsequently have expanded to involve a state purchase of 
the utilities' transmission networks and acquisition of utility-owned land, 
including spectacular coastal property near PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear 
power plant. 
Now they also have embraced further deregulation of California's 
dysfunctional electricity market. 
""Clearly, one of the terms being discussed is the regulatory environment,"" 
said Joseph Fichera, head of Saber Partners, a New York investment bank that 
is advising Davis in the talks. 
""The past situation has not worked well,"" he added. ""The utilities want some 
certainty about their future."" 
TENTATIVE DEAL WITH EDISON
To date, the governor has announced a tentative agreement with Edison for the 
state to buy the utility's power lines for almost $3 billion. Discussions 
with PG&E for a similar accord have dragged on for weeks. 
An Edison official, asking that his name be withheld, acknowledged yesterday 
that an end to the rate freeze is an expected result of the power- line sale. 
""Once the details of the pact are complete, dominoes will fall,"" the official 
said. ""One of the dominoes is the rate freeze."" 
A PG&E spokesman declined to comment. 
In fact, both Edison and PG&E have been aggressively seeking an end to the 
rate freeze for months. 
The two utilities have a lawsuit pending in federal court demanding that the 
PUC immediately raise rates so the utilities can recover almost $13 billion 
in debt accrued as a result of the freeze. 
""They have been trying a lot of things to get the rate freeze ended in 
various forms,"" said Carl Wood, who sits on the PUC. ""Adding it to the 
present talks is consistent with past behavior."" 
Wall Street has taken note that the negotiations no longer appear to be 
making progress. 
Paul Patterson, an energy industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, 
told clients on Monday that the discussions ""may have lost some momentum in 
recent days."" He did not give a reason. 
For his part, the governor sounded unusually cautious about the course of the 
talks when asked late last week if a breakthrough was imminent. 
SECRET STICKING POINTS
""We are going to take the transmission systems and the land that's deeded, 
and we will work out an agreement,"" Davis said at an appearance in San Jose. 
""But there are a number of sticking points in the talks with PG&E that I'm 
not going to reveal."" 
One of those sticking points apparently is an insistence that the sale of 
utility assets include a long-sought lifting of the rate freeze. 
Sources said lawyers from both PG&E and Edison had inserted the related terms 
into draft accords affecting each utility, and that the full impact of the 
additions was not realized by state officials until this week. 
One source said the language was just convoluted enough to slip beneath the 
radar screen of state negotiators. But the upshot, once the words had been 
parsed, was that the PUC effectively would lose control over power rates. 
CREDITWORTHINESS ON THE TABLE
In Edison's case, the terms of the tentative deal include the governor asking 
the PUC ""to support the creditworthiness"" of the utility. 
""This would ensure that future investments in both utility distribution and 
utility generation plants are provided fair returns of and on capital, 
consistent with current authorized returns and capital structure provisions,"" 
it says. 
Sources said the provision could be interpreted as a guarantee from the state 
that Edison would be permitted to recoup all outstanding costs from 
ratepayers. 
""There may be some assumptions about this language that the rate freeze ends 
if it is adopted,"" the Edison official said, adding that he saw no reason to 
disagree with such assumptions. 
But Fichera, Davis' adviser in the talks, insisted that nothing is set in 
stone, and that the negotiations are proceeding without a hitch. 
""This is a very complex transaction,"" he said. ""God and the devil are in the 
details.""

1026,"THE LEGISLATURE
No material change from the last update.  
The Legislature is in recess and the two bills that passed the Senate--SB 78 and SB 18--continue to sit in the Assembly, waiting for the Assembly to return on August 20th.
Support for the two bills in Assembly is currently very weak.
A handful of Democratic Assembly legislators and staff have been meeting over the recess to determine whether they can 1) reach agreement on the bill that the Assembly's been working on (AB 82), and 2) reach agreement with the Democrats in the Senate.
We will distribute the output of those meetings as soon as it is available.
The key features of SB 78 would: 
allow Edison to recover $2.5 of the $3.5 B of payables. 
earmark the $2.5 B to pay the banks and the QFs.  
leave Edison to figure out how to cover the remaining $1B in payables to suppliers (including Enron).
single out the largest business customers to pay for 100% of the $2.5 B in payables.
give the State the option to buy Edison's transmission assets at book.
do nothing to ensure Direct Access is maintained.
The key features of AB 82 would:
maintain a week form of Direct Access, though the bill doesn't go nearly far enough with respect to DA.
adopt some of SB 78's the onerous features (e.g., no authorization to pay back suppliers; force the biggest business customers to pay down Edison's debt to the banks and QFs).
The key features of SB 18 would:
restructure the way in which the upcoming bond issuance is financed by creating a ""dedicated utility rate component"" (i.e., a fixed charge) to service the bonds.
de-link payments to suppliers holding DWR contracts from payments to service the bonds to pay back the General Fund.
allow the PUC to hold a public hearing on DWR's contracts.

A consortium of small and large businesses and business associations sent a strongly worded letter today to Davis and all members of the CA Legislature expressing extreme opposition to both 78 and 82.  I have a copy of the letter and will distribute to anyone who would like to see it.
In the same letter, the business consortium strongly supports SB 18 because they fear they will get stuck with any out-of-the-money DWR contracts.
The consortium is lobbying hard to have the DWR contracts nullified or re-negotiated.
The Treasurer and the Governor oppose SB 18 because they believe 1) it would constitute contract breach, and 2) the contract provisions require the state to pay the present value of the contract plus LD in the event of a breach.
Calpine, who holds about 50% of the DWR contract volume, is also opposed to SB 18.
Opposition to any form of ""Edison bailout"" is increasing among policy makers, opinion leaders and the press
There is currently a 50-50 or better chance that the Legislature will NOT pass an Edison MOU before the session ends, though that could change.

THE CALIFORNIA PUC
Since the legislature has failed to pass comprehensive legislation addressing CA's crisis, the issues now revert back to the PUC.
In particular, the PUC is slated to rule on August 23rd on whether Direct Access should be suspended.
The Treasurer has said that DA must be suspended in order to remove any risk that DA might create with respect to impairing the revenue stream necessary to service the bonds.
AB 1X, the law that authorized DWR to buy power, gives the PUC the authority to suspend Direct Access.
Enron is leading a large group of customers and suppliers in an effort to stop the PUC from suspending Direct Access.
The group is writing a letter to Davis, the PUC, the Treasurer, DWR and the Legislature urging them to maintain Direct Access.
That letter should be released Friday or Monday.
The group is also making a submission to the PUC as early as Monday to provide the Commission with practical alternatives that would permit the the PUC to maintain Direct Access.
The group is also mounting a PR campaign that it wil launch simultaneously with the release of the letter and the submission to the PUC.
Currently, the chances that the PUC will suspend Direct Access on the 23rd is better than 50 percent, but a considerable effort is underway to reverse the situation.

1.   SBSC PRESIDENT TESTIFIES BEFORE CONGRESS ON BEST POLICIES FOR ECONOMY AND SMALL BUSINESS
 
SBSC President Darrell McKigney testified before the House Small Business Committee on October 10.  McKigney explained the important role that small business plays in the economy, and laid out a pro-small business policy agenda that featured speeding up and making permanent the tax cuts passed earlier this year; cutting or eliminating the capital gains tax; granting the President trade promotion authority; and enacting an energy plan that frees up domestic energy producers.

2.  SBSC ADDRESSES MEDIA ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
 
On October 11, SBSC Chairman Karen Kerrigan, President Darrell McKigney, and Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating discussed the state of small business and the economy in a tele-conference call with reporters from Newsweek, Business Week, Newsday, Human Events, CNSNews.com, Baltimore Sun, Arizona Republic and the Orange County Register.
 
 
2.   FREE TRADE FOR SMALL BUSINESS, TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY FOR THE PRESIDENT
 
SBSC chief economist Raymond J. Keating wrote a new report--""International Trade: The Business of Small Business""-that explains the importance of free and open trade for our economy and for the small business community.  Keating lays out a pro-free trade agenda, featuring passage of trade promotion authority for the President.
 
SBSC's report ""International Trade: The Business of Small Business"" can be downloaded from the front page at <http://www.sbsc.org/> under the ""21st Century Small Business Policy Series.""
 
3.   SBSC AND OTHER GROUPS URGE CONGRESS TO GRANT TPA TO PRESIDENT BUSH
 
SBSC Chairman Karen Kerrigan signed an October 9 letter to Congress urging passage of trade promotion authority (TPA) for the President.  In part, the letter said: ""World trade is increasingly important to small business.  Nearly one-third of all U.S. merchandise export sales -- the stuff whose labels read, ""Made in America""-- are produced by companies with less than 500 people on their payrolls.  Two-thirds of the firms participating in the export economy actually have less than 20 employees. What's more, the overall value of small-business exports has increased by 300 percent since the mid-1990s, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration.  Between 1987 and 1997, the number of U.S. small business exporters tripled from 65,900 to 202,185, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.  That number will grow substantially if President Bush were given Trade Promotion Authority.""

8. SBSC ORGANIZES ALLIES TO OPPOSE ""ONE-WATT"" MANDATES IN SENATE ENERGY LEGISLATION 
 
In an October 5 letter to Congress, SBSC Chairman Karen Kerrigan and representatives from other groups wrote: ""While it is still uncertain whether the Senate will consider comprehensive energy legislation, we are writing to alert you to our concern about a specific provision that could undermine the current work of the Congress to bring stability and growth to our nation's economy.  As this important legislation is being debated, we urge you to proceed with caution in imposing new burdens on businesses and consumers through mandates and regulations.  Specifically, we are asking that you reject the onerous ""one-watt"" provisions similar to those slipped into the House Energy bill, H.R. 4.  If enacted, these one-watt restrictions will cost consumers money and convenience, place undue burdens on businesses, while creating a new layer of government bureaucracy.""

The CDWR idea has already been implemented. Today the ISO couldn't get supply 
from the market and informed market participants that CDWR would sleeve deals 
to the ISO. This occurred at a time when CA was in Stage 3 emergency (only 
the second one ever) and anticipating rolling blackouts this evening. Enron 
and other suppliers began to aggregate supply to sell to CDWR presumably to 
go to the ISO.  Belden was concerned that Gray Davis may just withhold 
payment through CDWR when settlements are due. This concern prompted us to 
require paper confirms for hourly deals and a discussion between Christian 
Yoder and Steve Hall (Stoel Rives) with the assistant director at CDWR to 
make sure CDWR management was on board - which they confirmed verbally. 
Regardless of all of this we still have some paranoia about getting paid. Is 
Gray Davis willing to confirm that no payment issue through CDWR will occur? 
We are currently continuing to aggregate supply through the day but are 
hesitant to increase quantities without such assurance. Other suppliers 
appeared hesitant as well as they wouldn't sleeve the deals to CDWR.",Steve Gray Davis Yoder Steve Hall Stoel Rives,,CDWR ISO Enron

",Jim,,FYI
1050,"1.  I just met with Phil Cassidy of the Business Council about our 
invitations.  We discussed several backup options in anticipation that the 
new Administration might be difficult to enlist as speakers.  So far we have 
invited Powell, Rumsfeld, O'Neill, Ashcroft, Whitman, and Abraham, having 
previously been turned down by the congressional leaders.  Phil and I decided 
we should in light of the tight time left before the meeting, extend 
invitations to Greenspan and Larry Lindsey.  I also have a long list of third 
tier invites, many of whom come from the media.  Lora Sullivan and I will be 
making numerous follow up calls this week to the cabinet invitees.  Early 
next week I anticipate that we will need to start reaching out to 
nongovernment types, such as the media.  I will let you know.  We may also 
decide early next week to extend invites to a few interesting congressional 
committee leaders, such as Bill Thomas.  

2.  I had several meetings on the Hill Friday with Jeff Skilling.  He was 
very good, although he may have been a little taken back with my unabashed 
coaching at the start of the day.  If you get any feedback on his impression 
of the Hill meetings or the inauguration, I'd love to know how we can do 
things differently and better.  We met with Dick Armey, Don Nickles, Rob 
Portman, and Charlie Stenholm.  Of particular note, contrary to what he has 
always told Ken, namely that he would not get active on behalf of a company 
in Tom Delay's area, Dick Armey was very interested in what Jeff had to say 
and promised to spend personal time getting up to speed on electric 
restructuring and would assign a staff person to work the issue.  Jeff 
attended and thoroughly networked all of the Enron inaugural events, 
including our private dinner Saturday night with Reps. Blunt and Barton.  
Jeff was our star Enron attraction, given that Ken was sick and did not 
attend the dinner.   At the conclusion of our activities yesterday, I 
suggested to Jeff that he spend a day in DC every quarter or perhaps three 
times a year.  He seemed to like the idea, but stressed the importance of 
getting this travel on his calendar well in advance.  Ideally, we might marry 
this up with his trips to New York.  We could perhaps structure an evening 
dinner in DC coupled with a one-half day schedule with the 
Executive/congressional branches.  Jeff could then spend the rest of the day 
in NY.   Regardless of the time allotted, we can structure worthwhile time 
for Jeff in DC.  This will both raise and strengthen his profile.  Also I 
will be forwarding shortly notes from Jeff to the Members with whom he met.  

3.  I met with Rep. Culberson last Thursday.  As I Emailed earlier, he wants 
to start a campaign for Ken as NASA chair.  I owe Culberson a response on 
this.  I thought I would run into to Ken at one of Enron's inaugural events.  
I did not.  So I need to bug you for an answer on this.  Do you want me to 
kill this idea?   Also per Culberson's request, we have scheduled a one-half 
day tour for the Congressman in our office for Feb. 23.  

4.  Our inaugural events were extremely well attended and I think quite 
successful.  If you hear anything differently from any of our executives, I 
would be pleased to track down any problems. 

5.  Should I now follow up with Ken's office on the best way to be involved 
in Ken's DC efforts?  I am glad to do so, but I do not want to overstep.

offer them an opportunity to meet one another and discuss how we will proceed.
Next, I will begin scheduling meetings with some key people that  would

members would speak to these individuals back to back in 1 or 2 hour time

Then, a full day will be blocked out where the committee members will

Team--attached are my group's top 10 objectives at the headquarters level and 
at the in-country level for the international PR, marketing communication and 
social responsibility areas.  

How we prioritize

We arrive at these objectives after discussion with heads of the business 
units and senior management, and we focus on goals that support the priority 
business goals of the company and build/protect the reputation of the company 
as a whole.  On a quarterly basis (at least) we review these top objectives 
and ensure that we are staying on target.  Internationally, we are faced with 
numerous issues and crises which must be dealt with and they also take on a 
priority spot when they occur.  

There is an issue with prioritization that we must constantly deal with.  
Some of our clients are PR savvy and wish to use our services, which should 
please us except that sometimes small, low priority and visibility projects 
use too much of our time that should be spent elsewhere.  Conversely, we 
sometimes have important projects that the developer wishes to keep low 
budget and we are not allowed to have the level of input that we should. 

How human and financial resources are allocated

The bulk of our human resources currently are allocated to the regions, and 
the structure is an area in transition since the reorganization and in light 
of several open positions that we have.  We determine in conjunction with the 
business units the proper number and level of staff.  The regional PR head 
determines how his or her junior people are assigned.  At the headquarters 
level, we focus on the activities that benefit the company overall as well as 
top priority countries.  Marketing communication maintains adequate staff to 
meet customer demands, and adds temporary staff during peak periods.  

We all work on the highest priority items for the year, but also tend to 
focus on issues of the moment that are of greatest significance to the 
business unit leaders.   My goal is to keep people focused on the long-term 
objectives for the year and not get caught up in the day to day operations 
without this long term focus.  If there is an area I would like to further 
refine, it is making sure that we are better deploying our human resources on 
what is important.

How financial resources are allocated

We have a PR budget for each operating company, for international 
headquarters, for marketing services and for sustainable development.  At the 
regional level, figures are projected for each country and/or project and 
these are discussed with the various country leaders.  Headquarters budget is 
used for activities that benefit all areas and not one region or country.  

Marketing communication budget is on a bill-back basis (the most difficult to 
predict because it is comprised of costs for developing presentations and 
other marketing/sales tools.  This has been a trait of the former EI and is 
the expectation of developers--if you need it for marketing purposes you do 
it.)  As you will note in my objectives, I would like this department to 
arrange a billing system including their time and fixed costs that allows 
them to be completely self-supporting rather than allocating across business 
units.  This will encourage people to use their services more wisely.

When a new project is being pursued, budgets are approved for all aspects of 
the project including PR, employee communication and social responsibility.  
The social responsibility budgets typically fall short or are non-existent, 
and this is another area that we will be focusing on changing this year.

How this fits with budgeting process

Our allocation of resources is linked directly with our budgeting process.  
There are two exceptions:  

1--pursuing major projects that were not planned at the beginning of the 
year.  Budgets for these new pursuits are approved during the overall project 
approval process, and again, we must work to have greater input in this 
process.

2--costs for resolving major crises such as Cuiaba and Human Rights Watch 
have been significant and were not pre-budgeted.

1066,"Electricity prices soar as changes take hold: Tab skyrockets under rule 
easing wholesale controls
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published Dec. 12, 2000) 
Some wholesale electricity prices on California's Power Exchange nearly 
tripled between Friday and Monday and others nearly quadrupled, while 
officials declared another electric emergency. 
In the first full business day under new, sharply disputed trading rules 
aimed at averting blackouts, prices of electricity on the Power Exchange, 
where the bulk of California's electricity is bought and sold, surged far 
above Friday's $250 per megawatt hour. 
The day's first PX auction produced average prices of $904 per megawatt hour, 
and a second auction used to adjust transmission line use produced prices of 
$668. 
One year ago, the average PX price was about $30, Power Exchange spokesman 
Jesus Arredondo said. 
""Prices were crazy yesterday and they're crazier today,"" Arredondo said. 
""This will be the most expensive month ever in California, I'm sure of it."" 
The California Independent System Operator blamed high natural gas costs and 
strong electric demand throughout the West for Monday's price run-up, but 
critics suggested it was early evidence that the new trading rules have 
backfired. 
At the ISO's request, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission late Friday 
gave permission to lift a $250 price cap and replace it with a requirement 
that power sellers who set prices higher than $250 must explain them later. 
The ISO said the changes would improve the grid's stability by attracting 
more power to California, repaying plant owners for high natural gas costs 
and reducing last-minute deals. 
The rules were immediately attacked by Gov. Gray Davis and state regulators, 
who argued that the rules would drive up prices without solving the other 
problems. 
That's just what happened Monday, said Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Davis. 
""Price gouging has reached a new level,"" he said. ""It's not surprising. It's 
exactly what the governor predicted."" 
In addition, a ""glitch"" in the way the ISO and the PX use two-stage 
electricity auctions to ease congestion on transmission lines will 
temporarily spur more last-minute trading instead of less, according to power 
plant owners and the ISO. 
ISO officials, who have long warned that last-minute deals can hurt the 
stability of the electric grid, said the effect will be minimal, but Power 
Exchange officials predict it could be massive. The test will come today. 
In an effort to solve the problem, the PX late Monday asked FERC to make 
another emergency change in trading rules, lifting caps on the second round 
of power auctions, which are used to set ""congestion"" pricing. 
The PX buys electricity from power plant owners and sells it to buyers, 
almost universally the utilities, which then turn around and supply 
Californians power. The ISO was created to control the transmission grid, but 
it has emerged as the buyer of about one-fourth of California's power when 
stability problems arise, and it then resells that power to utilities. 
Meanwhile, the ISO declared another ""stage two"" electric emergency Monday 
afternoon -- the 12th since Nov. 1 -- and pleaded for continued conservation. 
Some big power users were told to reduce consumption, although the ISO said 
generally the outlook has improved slightly. 
About 8,700 megawatts of power were off line Monday, compared with a high of 
more than 11,000 last week. A megawatt can supply about 300 to 1,000 
households, depending on season and location. 
The ISO blames the almost unheard of cold-weather emergencies on an unusual 
number of power plants down for repairs and growth in other regions that 
compete with California for electricity. 
""It's a very tough problem right now,"" ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said. 
""I almost could look back and say summer was fun."" 
The governor, PUC president Loretta Lynch, consumer advocates and others 
blame the deregulated electric market for the cold-weather power crunches. 
As that controversy raged on, state officials who are monitoring the 
increasingly chaotic electricity situation began toting up the costs of last 
week's runaway prices. 
On Friday alone, according to the California Electricity Oversight Board, it 
cost $212 million to deliver power through the ISO-controlled grid, which 
serves about three-fourths of the state's electric consumers. 
That would be enough to fully pay for a new, cleaner-burning 500-megawatt 
power plant about every two days. 
Monday's bill won't be fully computed for another few days, but it appears 
that it will be significantly higher, according to the oversight board. 
""We have a huge transfer of wealth going on, and we're not getting anything 
for it,"" Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. spokesman Gregg Pruett said. 
Meanwhile, financial analysts Monday warned investors that the state's two 
largest utilities are finding it increasingly difficult to bridge the gap 
between frozen rates and power costs that escalate nearly daily. 
Credit rating agency Fitch Inc. on Monday lowered its long-term and 
short-term debt ratings for PG&E and Southern California Edison, as well as 
the latter's parent company, Edison International. Fitch cited ""increased 
liquidity pressure"" and uncertainty about the utilities' ability to recover 
the costs of their power purchases. 
The rating downgrades mean it will be more expensive for the utilities to 
borrow money in the future. 
Also on Monday, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and Banc of America 
Securities lowered their ratings on PG&E Corp.'s stock, which fell Monday to 
$21.94 a share, down $1.63, nearly 7 percent. The firm also lowered its 
rating for Edison International, whose stock closed at $18.63 a share, down 
$1.81, nearly 9 percent. 
Moody's Investors Service put the securities of PG&E and its parent PG&E 
Corp. on watch for a downgrade. 
PG&E estimates that at the end of November it had paid out $4.6 billion more 
for power than it has been able to collect, although consumer advocates 
disagree, pointing out that that number is significantly offset by utility 
revenues in other special accounts. 
Before the December run-up in wholesale prices, PG&E had requested a 17.5 
percent rate increase, which state regulators put on hold. Now the rate 
increase needed to cover its costs appears to be increasing daily, Pruett 
said, but he declined to say how much PG&E might seek. 
Although consumer advocates oppose a rate increase, some are beginning to 
talk quietly about increases being inevitable if wholesale prices cannot be 
brought back down. 
""It's not sustainable,"" said Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform 
Network and a member of the ISO board. ""It has to stop.""

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing
broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: ""Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue.""
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.",Copp swain Franz Houston Ballet William atre Imp Karen Dacko Frederic Franklin Peter Farmer Anne Heaton Desmond Heeley Carl Cunningham,,"AZURIX ENRON Corporate Sponsors Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre

What We're Reading[IMAGE]  Pearl Harbor: The Day of Infamy - An Illustrated History 
by Dan Van Der Vat
 President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously declared December 7, 1941 as ""A day that will live in infamy,"" the day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, pulling the U.S. into World War II. This visually stunning book, by noted historian Dan van der Vat, features groundbreaking research, over 250 images, including previously unpublished personal photos from the perspective of both Americans on the ground and Japanese in the air, as well as a moment-by-moment breakdown of the attack. There are also numerous personal accounts, memorabilia, and illustrations by Tom Freeman. A major achievement.

by Tom Brokaw
 As he's done in his immensely popular Greatest Generation volumes, Tom Brokaw again celebrates the trials and triumphs of the Americans who experienced the Depression and World War II. Album of Memories is a collection of letters written to Brokaw by those who lived during this period, and in some cases, their children. Complete with photographs and memorabilia, the overall emotional impact of these letters is intense. To read them is both a moving experience and an opportunity to experience history at its most intimate.

by Dan Kurzman
 Just after 5 a.m. on April 18, 1906, an earthquake measuring 8.3 on the Richter scale ripped through sleeping San Francisco, toppling buildings, exploding gas mains, and trapping thousands of citizens beneath tons of stone, broken wood, and twisted metal. Drawing on meticulously researched and eye-witness accounts, Dan Kurzman re-creates one of the most horrific events of the 20th century. More riveting than fiction but incredibly true, Disaster! is unforgettable history--a masterful account of the calamitous demise and astonishing resurrection of an American city. --From the publisher

History Bestsellers[IMAGE]  Time Lord : Sir Sanford Fleming and the Creation of Standard Time 
by Clark Blaise
 The remarkable story of Sandford Fleming, the man who created and then convinced all the nations of the world to adopt a unified standard for telling time. Standard Time was one of the crowning achievements of Victorian progressiveness and one of the few Victorian innovations to have survived practically unchanged into our era. Few technological inventions have proven to be both as invisible and as important. In Time Lord, Clark Blaise introduces us to an almost-forgotten figure, who saw the world as a whole and overcame traditional and national objections to the rational accounting of time. --From the publisher
  Our Price: $19.20  You Save: $4.80  (20%)     [IMAGE]  April 1865 : The Month That Saved America 
by Jay Winik
 April 1865 is one of those rare, shining books that takes a new look at an old subject and changes the way we think about it. Jay Winik shows that there was nothing inevitable about the end of the Civil War, from the fall of Richmond to the surrender at Appomattox to the murder of Lincoln. Readers will come away with a new appreciation for that momentous month and a sharpened understanding of why and how the Civil War was fought. This is a magnificent work--surely the best book on the Civil War to be published in some time.

 A no-holds-barred examination of the National Security Agency packed with startling secrets about its past, newsbreaking revelations about its present-day activities, and chilling predictions about its future powers and reach. James Bamford first penetrated the wall of silence surrounding the NSA in 1982, with the much-talked-about bestseller, The Puzzle Palace. In Body of Secrets, he offers shocking new details about the inner workings of the agency, gathered through unique access to thousands of internal documents and interviews with current and former officials. --From the publisher

MILITARY RESALE GROUP, as a private company with limited

MILITARY RESALE GROUP ADDS BAYER, A MAJOR BRAND, TO ITS
PRODUCT LINE

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.--Oct. 22, 2001--Military Resale
Group, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL) announced today that the Bayer
Corporation, a leader in the health and beauty aid
industry, has been added to its product supplier network.

Bayer is a very well recognized brand name in its market
categories, nationally and internationally. It is estimated
that sales of Bayer's products can add about $300,000
annually to revenues of Military Resale Group.

President Ethan D. Hokit commented: ``Military Resale Group
is pleased and complimented to have become able to
represent such a prestigious manufacturer as Bayer in our
distribution activities. We have previously forecast that
we expect MRG's sales to increase from $4.5 million in 2000
to reach $5.5 million over the next year. Bayer's new
presence is expected to make a major contribution to this
$1 million increase in annual sales that we foresee.''

Military Resale Group, Inc. was incorporated in 1997 when
it acquired a 50-year-old distributor to the Military
Resale Market. At that time, MRG's annual sales were
$750,000 and they have since soared five-fold in three
years to $4.5 million in 2000. Military Resale Group is now
a publicly owned company as a result of its recent
acquisition by Bactrol Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL).

The Military Resale Market is a $15 billion niche market,
with 13,000,000 authorized patrons, which operates under
the aegis of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), a
Department of Defense agency. The DOD's objective, in this
area, is to operate resale store systems, which sell
groceries (at commissaries) and general merchandise (at
exchanges, i.e., PXs) at the lowest possible prices. The
resulting average cost savings of about 25% are a major
fringe benefit (untaxed) to military personnel. The
competitive structure of the Military Resale Market
consists of a few large distributors, who do not dominate
the industry, and hundreds of small ones. The post-
acquisition strategy of MRG is to grow, primarily, by
acquiring other small distributors and, secondarily, by
internal growth.

1103,"After talking further with MISO folks about the new attachment M, it appears that the MISO will _effectively_ be requiring physical losses, although they don't come out and say that. Financial losses are essentially at the option of the TO, so we ""may"" be able to do Financial losses if the TOs want to offer the service.

In more detail, this is how the process will work:

TCs will use the MISO's loss calculator to identify impacted TOs
If ALL TOs have provided financial loss pricing information, then it will be possible to buy losses
If not, the TC will be required to self supply

TOs can change their loss pricing (or desire to offer financial losses) every 12 hours.  Effectively, this means it will be difficult at best to manage risk associated with having the FIN rug pulled out from under us at scheduling time.  I will continue to work on this issue with Mike  and push for a financial solution that provides for our needs.

 Kevin,   <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:of=

EWC requires three clarifications to the PPA in order to get the project fi=
nanced and sold.  All previously requested amendments proposed by the equit=
y purchaser have been dropped, and EWC will take the resulting pricing redu=
ction. =20

I want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are=
.   These clarifications conform to the original deal and are NOT changes t=
o the deal. =20

 1.  Banking Provisions.   EWC and EPMI agreed that energy and renewable en=
ergy credits (""RECS"") produced by the Indian Mesa II wind generating facili=
ty in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would, on a cumulat=
ive basis, offset any deficiencies of energy and RECS in subsequent years. =
Section 4.04 of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carry=
over mechanism which was contemplated by the parties. (This section origina=
lly provided for the carryover, but in an effort to simplify the language, =
the aggregate carryover concept was clouded.)  Both the project lenders and=
 the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified.  =
There has never been a disagreement between EPMI and EWC on the intention o=
f the carryover banking provisions. EPMI's most recent refusal to make this=
 clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal

 2.  Grid Curtailment EWC and EPMI  drafted the contract  with specific pro=
visions relating to  termination resulting from grid curtailment, Section 5=
.04  .  There is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covere=
d  under the termination provision relating  to force majeure under Section=
 5.02.  This  inconsistency is the problem.  Neither EWC nor EPMI were to p=
ay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment.  The propos=
ed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of  t=
he PPA  be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would =
not give rise to termination payments.  This clarification is consistent wi=
th the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal.

 3.  EPMI Credit Support.  EPMI's obligations under the PPA are guaranteed =
by Enron.  The Indian Mesa II PPA permits EPMI to assign the PPA to certain=
 affiliates without consent of the seller.   Any assignment by EPMI would n=
ot relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract, and the Enr=
on guarantee would remain in place.  However, the project lenders have requ=
ired clarification that the Enron guarantee would either explicitly remain =
in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good =
as Enron Corp's credit quality.  The project lender's have also requested t=
hat the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any sub=
stitute PPA used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be w=
ith a party that had a credit quality similar to Enron Corp's, since that i=
s the credit that is supporting the Indian Mesa II PPA.  This will not affe=
ct the value of the contract to a third party since Enron bears this obliga=
tion unless released by the project.

Under the dispute resolution provisions of the PPA we could certainly pursu=
e declaratory relief under arbitration.  Our sense is that this does nothin=
g but ensure delay.

 From an Enron perspective:

?     The sale of the equity and the financing of the non-recourse debt on =
the Indian Mesa II project is currently at a standstill due to issues surro=
unding the ambiguities in the PPA

?      While the debt financing for the Indian Mesa I project is in place (=
different offtaker) the proposed equity sale to AEP is linked to the sale o=
f the Indian Mesa II project.

?     If Enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within=
 the next month, Enron will likely end up with approximately $153M less cas=
h at year end than it counted on in its plan, in addition to any decrease i=
n planned earnings

?    The after-tax return to Enron in a ""hold"" situation is 0%, due to Enro=
n being in the Alternative Minimum Tax position, i.e. it cannot use the tax=
 benefits.

It was clear in the discussions with the City of San Antonio that these cla=
rifications would have had no affect on value.  =20

Louise,

Attached is the original email from Dave Delainey and John Lavorato. In my opinion, utilities and municipalities do not fall within the EES target market of being ""less energy intensive and less sophisticated in their management of energy"" (see below). Neither would aggregators fall into this category.

I am also concerned about the principle of EES approaching utilities to encourage them to act as an EES sales agent. I believe this ultimately results in little more than aggregation of load into wholesale levels - and in any case, results in multiple representatives from Enron pitching products which achieve similar results from the customer's perspective.

In addition, providing EES load management solutions may jeopordize other ENA projects which require that load (services deals, plant construction, etc. in addition to the usual wholesale product suite). I am concerned about the risk (however slight) posed by the EES activity as ENA actively tries to develop relationships with these customers and to close substantial wholesale transactions.

I'll wait for your thoughts on Monday before I go to EES with these concerns.

Thanks,

Dave

Saw in the WSJ today that the judge allowed Enron to ""end"" 600-700 supply
contracts. Is that EES? If so are they going to still be in business? I ask
because of my question from yesterday re the annual load carve-out. Is there
anything left to carve out??

1129,"Executive Summary:

Bottom line- QFs better off today, utilities in worse shape
After passing Senate, the QF Bill fails on technical grounds in Assembly
Cal Energy ruling provides possible escape for QFs from utility commitments
California net short gas supply for the summer worsens if QFs break contracts
Hedge funds acquiring utility commercial paper, further litigation expected

1.	QF Bill Fails In Surprise Twist

AB 8X (the QF  bill) failed in the Assembly (48-24). The Republicans were opposed because three  measures, the SDG&E fix, the AB 1X fix, and the QF fix were all rolled  into one bill by the Senate. They want the three measures split up. Concern  was raised by San Diego members regarding those provisions and they wanted to  see it separately in the bill form that it is currently in SB 43X.   As noted yesterday, the QFs will now await a CPUC ruling on Tuesday.

2.	Cal Energy Ruling Sets Stage for ""Dozens"" of Similar Q.F. Suits
 
The CPUC ruling is now less important because of the Cal Energy ruling yesterday, which gave the QFs another tactic to escape their commitments to the near bankrupt utilities. Cal Energy reportedly would have filed an  involuntary bankruptcy tomorrow (Friday) had they not won their law  suit.  Dozens, if not hundreds of suits identical to  that filed by CalEnergy can now be expected from the other QFs.  The QFs  reportedly see themselves as free from the utilities now and want to sell direct  into the merchant market, possibly out-of-state.  They also want to avoid  any deal whereby the state would force them to supply power in a Stage 2 or  Stage 3 alert, and will contest any such measure with the FERC.
 
3.	Summer Outlook Worsens

 The outlook for the summer now appears much  grimmer for the state.  If the gas-fired QFs alone manage to extricate  themselves from their contracts with the utilities, the state will be a net  10,000 MW short for the summer rather than 5,000 MW.  This is a much larger  net short position to fill, and will be much harder for State Treasurer Angelides to sell to  Wall Street.  If all of the QFs break their contracts, the state will be  14,000 to 15,000 MW short.  Essentially, if the QFs are successful in court  (as it appears they would be), they are no longer part of the pool of low,  fixed-rate power that the state can count on.  The onus now appears to be on Treasurer Angelides  to come up with a rate schedule.  The QFs may go to him and ask for the  state to act as forward cover for their gas contracts (the state would, of  course, charge for this privilege) and negotiate a more flexible rate  structure.  

4	Pressure Mounts on Utilities

None of this helps the utilities'  situation.  In fact, now that the QFs have a way out of their contracts  through the courts, it appears that the business base of the utilities is  reduced, so they are actually in a worse situation.  Reportedly some of the utilities' commercial  paper now has been sold to hedge funds.  As one source put it, ""the vultures  have moved in.""  These are ""the types of people who litigate.""

We are an early stage e-commerce company that offers the
world's largest selection of wildlife merchandise. We are ready
to obtain our first round of financing.  We would like
to have 5 co-branding partners who would receive equity positions in
our company.  We would incorporate their logo throughout our site and
include their PR materials with each order shipped.  Target partners
would include the utility and energy companies.  Since your
company is active in this market, you may know of someone who can assist
us.

We see utility/energy companies as a compatable fit because of their
interest in projecting a positive wildlife/environmental image.

About our company:

WildlifeCollectibles.Com is a specialty catalog company featuring
wildlife merchandise.  We have the world's largest selection of wildlife
merchandise.  Currently in the wildlife merchandise niche
there are no entities offering broad merchandise selections for each
animal specie.  We are filling this void by operating 22 ""sub-niche""
stores under the WildlifeCollectibles.Com brand.  These 22 storefronts
will represent 105 wildlife species.  Seven of these storefronts are
operational and the backend inventory systems are complete for the other
15.  We are in the process of loading them on the Internet.

One major component not yet installed on our site is our ""Facts About
the Specie"" page.  We will have reference information available for
every wildlife specie listed on our site.  At present,
there is no central repository of reference material available for most
species.  Britanica.com has reference information available for only 11
species.  This will attract school age children with their parents
tagging along.

We are looking for a total of 5 million dollars.  In order to assist
companies in purchasing an equity position/co-branded arrangement with
us, we are willing to finance their investment.  We will take $25,000.00
a month for 40 months from 5 corporate partners.  This will allow them
to budget the expense through Public Relations or Marketing.

I hope I have given you enough information to understand what
we would like to do, so you can either assist us or point us in the
right direction.  We would pay a commission and provide a small equity
stake in our company to the individual who signs on the utility/energy
companies for us.

Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

Texas Instruments' High-Performance 4-20mA Transmitter Targets
Temperature And Bridge Sensors=1D'Smart' Programmable Device Reduces Manufa=
cturing
Costs By Offering Digitally-Controlled Adjustments

TUCSON, Ariz., Jun 1, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Texas Instruments
Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) (TI) today announced a ""smart"" programmable 4-20mA
current-loop transmitter from the company's Burr-Brown product line designe=
d for
temperature and bridge sensor applications, as well as remote data acquisit=
ion,
weighing systems, and industrial process control. See
http://www.ti.com/sc/aap6372u.

The high-performance XTR108 allows for digital calibration of sensor and
transmitter errors via a standard digital serial interface, eliminating
expensive potentiometers or circuit value changes. Calibration settings can=
 be
stored in an inexpensive external EEPROM for easy retrieval during routine
operation.

Digitally-controlled adjustments dramatically reduce manufacturing costs an=
d
allow companies to build a single sensor design to serve a wide range of ne=
eds.
Individual units can be stocked and later programmed and reprogrammed for a=
ny of
hundreds of possible end-customer specifications (special temperature range=
s,
etc.). Sensors can also be reprogrammed in the field, if necessary.

""By allowing the user to digitally adjust the gain, offset and linearity of=
 the
analog output, the XTR108 eliminates the need for manual trimming of
potentiometers and the costs associated with this process,"" said John Brown=
,
strategic marketing engineer for TI's High-Performance Linear products.
""Furthermore, among the very few similar ICs on the market, the XTR108 prov=
ides
more versatile multi-channel input and excitation multiplexing.""

The XTR108's wide programmable gain amplifier (PGA) range allows full- scal=
e
inputs from 5 to 320mV. The all-analog signal path contains a built-in
sub-regulator, voltage reference, input multiplexer, autozeroed PGA, dual
programmable current-sources, linearization circuit, internal oscillator,
control logic, and an output current amplifier.

Current sources directed through the multiplexer can be used to excite RTD
temperature sensors, pressure bridges, or other types of transducers. The
XTR108's uncommitted op amp can be used to convert current into a voltage, =
or
for four-wire RTD circuits.

Functionally, a 4-20mA transmitter provides accurate transmission of analog
signals from sensors (used to monitor physical parameters in industrial
processes such as temperature and pressure) to remotely located measurement
equipment. The sensor signal is amplified, linearized, and transmitted in t=
he
form of current with no power supply required at the transmitter site. 4-20=
mA
current loops are not affected by line resistance and are much more immune =
to
electrical interference.

Available Today

The XTR108 is available now and is packaged in an SSOP-24. Suggested resale
pricing is $3.45 in 1,000 piece quantities. The device is specified for -40
degrees Celsius to +85 degrees Celsius temperature range.

Texas Instruments Incorporated is the world leader in digital signal proces=
sing
and analog technologies, the semiconductor engines of the Internet age. The
company's businesses also include sensors and controls, and educational and
productivity solutions. TI is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and has
manufacturing or sales operations in more than 25 countries.

Market Watch

*** ""Hope"" was the big story yesterday, hope that Intel
would offer up some encouraging comments in its late
afternoon conference call.

*** Hopeful investors bought stocks in sufficient
quantities to carry the Dow Jones industrial average to a
20-point gain and to spur the NASDAQ to a 46-point advance.
After the close of regular trading, Intel announced that
its business is awful, but not disastrous. Investors
responded jubilantly to the not-miserable news. Shares of
Intel, which rose $1.32 to $31.14 ahead of the midquarter
conference call, rose another dollar or so, in after-hours
trading.

*** As Hank Herrmann, chief financial officer at Waddell &
Reed Financial Services, tells smartmoney.com, ""The market
is putting its hands over its eyes and saying 'It looks
good to me.'""

*** Bill Fleckenstein offers a similarly skeptical reaction
to the notion that the tech sector is recovering, ""Today,
retail companies with PC exposure gave a first-hand view of
souring conditions. Circuit City (CC) released its same-
store sales, which were down 25% year-over-year, led by
poor PC sales. And Ingram Micro (IM) announced layoffs. It
is no secret that demand stinks and PC inventories are up.
There is not one single shred of evidence that anything is
getting better for Intel.""

*** Nor for anyone else. Yesterday's employment data, for
example, showed initial jobless claims rose yet again to
432,000 for the week ended June 2nd - the worst number since
Sept. '92. Continuing claims for unemployment benefits
spiked more than 7% in a single week.

*** A few of the newly unemployed came from Wall Street's
ranks. So far this year, Wall Street firms have announced
plans to eliminate more than 10,000 jobs.

*** Given J.P. Morgan's dire earnings forecast two days
ago, it is certainly not the only Wall Street firm that
might be going on a ""Slimfast"" diet.

*** Says Goldman Sachs chief executive, Henry Paulson, ""We
are clearly in a down cycle, and I think you'll get worse
before it gets better."" Already, Goldman Sachs has
announced plans to reduce its work force by 12%.

*** The slowdown affects numerous dependent industries of
all sizes. At Patroon's restaurant, a popular midtown
Manhattan venue for ""deal-closing"" dinners, owner Ken
Aretsky misses the dot.com bubble. ""The days when $1,000
bottles of wine flowed like water are gone,"" he tells
Bloomberg News.

*** Still, the average fund manager made $436,000 last
year, up from $322,500 in '99. The average fund investor,
by contrast, lost 17%.

*** The days of Manhattan office rents soaring ever higher
are also gone. Yesterday, a commercial real estate broker
e-mailed a brochure to me advertising office space from a
""motivated sublessor"" at nearby 14 Wall Street. (This
building is directly across Broad Street from the Grant's
Investor offices at 30 Wall). It turns out that the
motivated sublessor is none other than the struggling
financial website, thestreet.com.

*** The revenue-starved enterprise is offering the entire
14th floor - 34,719 square feet - on a five-year sublet for
about $30 per foot. All told that would be more than $1
million per year - money that the Street.com would rather
not have to pay. Were somebody's eyes bigger than their e-
stomach?

*** US hotel room revenues are experiencing their largest
decline in a decade. Likewise, airline revenues are
experiencing extreme turbulence.

*** May was a particularly cruel month for the commercial
carriers, to judge from Continental's harrowing 10% revenue
decline last month. According to the Air Transport
Association, domestic airline revenues have been in a
tailspin since January.

*** Move over N.I.M.B.Y.s! Make way for Russian
""I.M.B.Y.s."" NIMBY a popular acronym for ""not-in-my-back-
yard,"" refers to folks who prefer not to live near
industrial facilities like nuclear power plants and the
like. But Russia's parliament, the Duma, has adopted a more
pragmatic and, yes, capitalistic philosophy. (See, they're
learning!) The Duma approved a bitterly contested plan in
which Russia may earn about $20 billion over ten years by
importing and processing spent nuclear fuel.

*** While Lady Liberty tells the world, ""Give me your
tired, your poor, your huddled masses,"" Mother Russia says,
""Bring me your highly toxic, your glowing, your radioactive
waste masses.""

Eric Fry

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * **

And more notes...from Bill back in Paris

*** ""Almost every statistic that involves consumer health
is horrible and getting worse,"" write Chad Hudson of the
Prudentbear.com. Consumers continue to spend money they
don't have, while their incomes go down and their costs of
living go up.

*** Brian Nottage, with Economy.com, argues that the
consumer is facing a second major crisis. After the blow-up
of the dot.com bubble comes the explosion of the ""lifestyle
bubble"" in which consumers have been living for the last
few years.

*** But when the lifestyle bubble pops, corporate earnings
and stock prices must fall. Consumers must reduce
spending...pay down debt...and build savings. While there
is no sure way of knowing when this will happen...or even
if it will happen....it leaves stock market investors in a
dangerously exposed position. ""High risk, no return...no
thanks,"" concludes Peter Bernstein.

*** What's the alternative? How about Morocco, Egypt,
Jordan and other Middle Eastern markets? ""There is a very
low correlation between the Middle East and the rest of the
world,"" says a broker quoted in Forbes. How about CIB, an
international bank in Egypt? ""It's like being able to buy
J.P. Morgan Chase with an 11% dividend yield and a P/E of 5
times 20001 earnings."" Or, Eastern Tobacco, another
Egyptian company, it can be yours for only 4 times
earnings.

*** Meanwhile, in the Western Hemisphere...""Haiti is an
embarassment."" wrote my friend Doug Casey on a recent trip
there. ""Although, the quality of the cuisine is at least as
good as that in France, dining out at the few restaurants
that are still open is about all that passes for
entertainment these days; the lack of tourists and
abundance of crime combine to severely limit possibilities.
So does the fact electricity is predictably out at least
several hours every day; every home and business must have
its own generator. And crime really is a problem."" (see:
Zombies Workers and The Fight For Survival
http;//ww.dailyreckoning.com/body_headline.cfm?id=1206)

*** Tony Blair, of course, won yesterday's vote in Britain.
""I just forgot to vote,"" said a friend in London, ""the
whole thing just didn't seem to make any difference."" And
this from my friend, Martin Spring: ""Britain's election
campaign is so boring that watching paint dry is more
exciting. That's not a throwaway line - investigators
actually compared the pulse rate and blood pressure of a
test group watching vinyl emulsion drying on a wall and
vote-chasing politicians, and got higher readings for the
paint.""

GOD, MAN, AND ALAN GREENSPAN

""Tell me why do fools fall in love...""
fragment of popular song from the late '50s

Why must stocks fall in price?

I pose the question again today, dear reader, because I
know it interests you, as it does me. If stocks do not have
to fall in price, we could buy the big names of the S&P -
even at 28 times earnings. Maybe they would rise
higher...and stay higher...forever.

Stock prices rise from time to time - as if on an
irregular, unpredictable ocean tide. Waves of bullishness
rise up...between troughs of despair...and crash into the
rocky shoreline. No matter how high the waves, nor how low
the tide might ebb, sooner or later, as Jeremy Grantham
reminds us - stock prices regress to sea level.
The memory of man runneth not to the contrary.

Theory confirms experience, in this case as in others.
After all, Why should investors be willing to pay more for
a dollar of earnings this year than they were 5 years ago?
Why would they settle for a return of 5% on one investment
when they could get 10% on another?

Stocks are nothing more than partial ownership of
businesses. People rarely buy businesses for fun. They buy
them for the income they will produce and let the price of
shares rise and fall along with business earnings.

Over time, share prices tend to rise...but only in line
with increased and accumulated earnings. If there were no
competition and no alternatives, businesses might increase
profit margins year after year. But that would be a
different world than the one we live in. Without
alternatives, there would be no stock market and no
decisions for an investor to make.

As it is, competition holds profits down and directs
investors' money so as force all investment profits down to
the same sea level of returns, adjusted for risk and other
variables.

Over time, an article in this month's Fortune tells us,
companies' earnings grow alongside GDP, inflation, and
stock prices. Investors should expect only about 6% per
year...plus dividends of, currently, only 1.2%.

But during a 17-year bull market, stock market returns rose
far above the mean. A drop back to sea level requires
either a long period of low or zero returns...as long as 10
to 15 years. Or, stocks could fall sharply - with the S&P
down about 60% estimates Fortune, reducing P/Es from 28 to
about 10 - and then resume its normal rate of return.

But, look carefully. For there, standing on the beach, an
aged, care-worn little man holds out a staff. It is King
Alan Greenspan Canute, bidding the waters to hold fast.
'Stay where you are,' he commands. ""Resist the tug of the
business cycle, ignore the tilt of the credit cycle, and
ignore the lunatic phases of investor sentiment...that
inconstant moon of irrational exuberance and unreasonable
gloom....""

""It takes faith to believe in the invisible hand,"" said
Mark Skousen at last week's lecture in Paris. ""You can't
see it. And yet, we know it works.""

Everyone has faith in something, dear reader. Some have
faith in Adam Smith's 'invisible hand"" of God. Others have
faith in Mr. Greenspan's wrinkled mitts.

Some people believe they can think their way to the truth.
Others wait for it to be revealed to them. But one way or
another, we arrive at a truth we find convenient and hold
to it...until the real thing finally falls upon us.

Your correspondent...
Waiting for the truth to fall upon him

Bill Bonner

P.S. ""Did you miss us?"" asked Maria, upon our return from
London.

""Well, it just wasn't the same without you,"" came her
mother's careful reply.

Get Better ""Insider"" Information Than Alan Greenspan!

Seven days before PG&E announced that California was headed
for an energy crisis, the ""Volume Spike"" trading system
started flashing. Two tiny companies (that provide
technology for the electricity giants) appeared on its
radar screen. The ""Volume Spike"" detected inside activity
just before the stocks rose 339% and 300%! You could have
profited along with them. With 16 more states warning about
summer crises, you could make huge gains over the next 4
months.

1203,"I consulted with Kevin before I took the oars in trying to answer your 
question, as well as the questions raised in Drew's e-mail.  Here's what we 
found out...

Steve's question:

What economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New 
Mexico (maybe 3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us 
expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California?

What you're really asking here is ""What are the comparative economics of 
energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline?""  In this 
analysis, there are a few considerations -- (1) original capital cost to 
construct facilities, (2) the operating cost of the facilities, including 
energy loss, and (3) environmental and other permitting considerations. 

 Engineers tell us that, as a rule of thumb, high voltage transmission lines 
and tower facilities cost approximately $800,000 to $1MM/mile to construct 
turnkey.  This figure is comparable to the $1MM/mile ""rule of thumb"" we use 
for turnkey construction of mainline diameter (30-36"") high-pressure steel 
pipeline.  

In terms of operating costs, for anything over 100 miles in length, there are 
three (3) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission: (1) 
transformation loss, (2) radiation loss (EFM) and (3) heat loss across the 
conductors.  A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3%.  This 
number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on 
Transwestern's pipeline.   

The most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission 
lines is in the area of permitting.  There just aren't many new transmission 
lines being approved.  It was suggested by more than one source that an 
electric transmission project on the order posited in your example, could 
take anywhere from 6 to 10 years to secure authorization.  The issues of 
electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation around high voltage power lines, along 
with other wildlife endangerment concerns, are significant obstacles in 
securing permits for right-of-way.

In short, the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be 
comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and 
electric transmission lines, the protracted permitting process for electric 
transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate 
returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure.


Drew's questions:

1. What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts 
his plant?

For purposes of this exercise, I'm assuming we're talking gas-fired 
generation.  Developers generally describe four considerations in deciding 
where to site a new electric power plant:
 1. Market area demand (distributive) and/or Transmission access to market
 2. Water rights for turbine cooling
 3. Ease of permitting (environmental, encroachment, fed/state/local 
regulations, affected agencies/jurisdiction)
 4. Proximity to natural gas pipeline/supply infrastructure  


2. Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various 
utilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much 
the same all over?

FERC Order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of 
conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and 
between other utilities and/or power pools in the various operating regions.  
FERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission 
access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate 
their transmission/reliability functions from their wholesale merchant 
functions. The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under 
FERC Order 436/500/636 affecting interstate natural gas pipelines.  It's 
pretty obvious from the California example this past summer, that with 
respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual 
states, particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of 
Independent System Operators (ISO's), there is substantial room for 
improvement (and possible further FERC involvement).
 
""In the open access final rule (Order No. 888), the Commission issues a 
single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of 
service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission 
service.  All public utilities that own, control, or operate interstate 
transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro 
forma tariff.  They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own 
wholesale energy sales and purchases.  Order No. 888 also provides for the 
full recovery of stranded costs--that is, costs that were prudently incurred 
to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use 
open access to move to another supplier.""  


3.  How do IPP's decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy 
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc. 
separately)?

In my experience, there is no ""one size fits all"" formula or strategy.  For 
example, in the past we've seen Calpine take a very hands-on approach to 
supplying its IPP projects.  In the mid to late '80's, during the build out 
of several QF's (cogens), Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground 
and dedicated them to the project.  In today's market, Calpine has scavenged 
the gas and basis traders from Statoil and set-up a natural gas desk for the 
purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western 
U.S. power projects.  In other projects, developer/owners and their lenders 
are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply/transportation 
to the project.  In short, projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply/ 
transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics 
and secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFP's for gas 
supply/transportation, or whether to take a more hands-on approach ala 
Calpine.


4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care?

Last December, the FERC issued Order No. 2000, a final rule on Regional 
Transmission Organizations (RTO's).  Order 2000 builds on the foundation of 
Orders 888 and 889 (issued in 1996).  According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker, 
Order 2000 makes ""a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations 
from the influence of electricity market participants.""  Therefore, Order 
2000 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the 
functional unbundling adopted in Orders 888 and 889, continuing balkanization 
of the electric transmission grid based on corporate, not state or regional 
boundaries, as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of 
privately-owned transmission companies.  

FERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation.  The order 
initiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation.  The 
Order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned ""public 
utilities"" that are subject to FERC jurisdiction, and requires these private 
utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate 
the needs of transmission owning state/municipal, cooperative and federally 
owned systems.  FERC believes that, regardless of format, RTO's will offer 
the following benefits: (1) alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused 
by structural changes in the industry, (2) improve efficiencies in 
transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion 
management, (3) improve grid reliability, (4) remove remaining opportunities 
for discriminatory practices, (5) improve market performance, (6) increase 
coordination among state regulatory agencies, (7) cut transaction costs, (8) 
facilitate the success of state retail access programs, and (9) facilitate 
lighter-handed regulation. 

Critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility, voluntary RTO 
formation and transmission rate reforms (i.e., incentives), Order 2000 defers 
for case-specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved 
in order to create an operational RTO.   Moreover, Order 2000 does not compel 
any transmission owner to join an RTO, but provides only regulatory guidance 
and incentives for willing participants, as well as a veiled threat of 
further consequences for the hold-outs. 

As to the final part of the question (""why should we care?""), presumably, the 
development of a fully-functioning RTO network will promote both the 
efficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders.  As 
FERC reads it, the future of gas-fired generation for both merchant and 
utility systems, depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission 
system.  Therefore, the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and 
the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure.  Unfortunately, 
sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately 
cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals.  


5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?

Natural gas prices of $5/MMBtu can only ""kill"" gas-fired power plants in 
those instances where (1) there are more economical alternatives to natural 
gas fuel, (2) demand for electric power is offset through demand side 
management or (3) natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly 
prohibited from use as a power plant fuel.  In the Western U.S. marketplace, 
particularly in California, I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel 
for electric power generation.  Renewable resources currently meet less than 
5% of the total electric resource requirements.  $32/barrel oil prices give 
fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas (even at a $5/MMBtu 
price).  Moreover, California environmental and permitting regulations make 
the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than 
natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible.   While demand 
side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting 
resource needs, historically, they have served only a minor role in 
offsetting the growth in electric power.  As to the final point, I'm unable 
to comment on the risk of future legal/regulatory restrictions governing the 
use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel.

Reliant Energy Plans to Form Two Public Companies

Reliant Energy said it plans to file with the Texas Public Utility
Commission a business separation plan under which it would divide into two
publicly traded companies to separate its unregulated businesses from its
regulated businesses.

The company plans an initial public offering of approximately 20% of the
common stock of its unregulated operations late this year or early in 2001,
assuming market conditions remain favorable. The company expects the IPO to
be followed by a distribution to shareholders of the remaining stock of the
unregulated company within 12 months. The remaining businesses, which are
predominately regulated, will be structured as a holding company.

The unregulated company will own Reliant Energy's unregulated power
generation and related energy trading and marketing operations, its
unregulated retail businesses, which currently include energy,
telecommunications and internet services, and the company's European
electric generating and trading/marketing operations. The plan also
contemplates that in 2004 the unregulated company will receive from the
regulated company cash equal to the market value of the regulated company's
interest in its Texas regulated generation operations. In addition, the
unregulated company will have an option to purchase the regulated company's
interest in these operations at a price equal to the market value.

The regulated company will include Reliant Energy's electricity and natural
gas companies, which serve about four million customers in the U.S. and
include Reliant Energy HL&P/Entex, Reliant Energy Arkla, Reliant Energy
Entex and Reliant Energy Minnegasco. Other operations in the entity will
include its U.S. interstate pipelines, its interests in Latin America and,
initially, its Texas regulated generation.

1241,"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Pompano refuses $10,000 `gift' from Texas firm that wants power-plant OK 

By LISA J. HURIASH Sun-Sentinel?????? 
Web-posted: 11:43 p.m. Dec. 7, 2000

???POMPANO BEACH -- The city has returned a $10,000 check to a powerful 
Texas-based company that wants to build a controversial power plant here.
???Enron North America, one of the world's largest energy conglomerates, has 
proposed a 510-megawatt plant for a 30-acre site south of Sample Road and 
east of Florida's Turnpike. 
???Company officials hand-delivered the check last Friday, requesting that 
the money be used for cultural arts programs. The city manager returned it on 
Tuesday. 
???""While your donation is believed to be a genuine and unrelated corporate 
support of the community, the timing of your donation has the potential of 
creating a false impression and perception of its intent and purpose,"" City 
Manager C. William Hargett Jr. wrote in a letter to Steve Krimsky, director 
of Enron. 
???""Therefore, I am returning your check."" 
???The company is planning to pitch its development project to the city's 
Planning and Zoning Board later this month. Eventually the issue will come 
before the City Commission.
???The company hopes to start construction in April and begin operating the 
plant on May 1, 2002. It would be the fifth power plant in Broward County, 
and the third largest.
???City officials applauded returning the check to Enron.
???""I think their intentions were very questionable,"" said Commissioner Kay 
McGinn. ""The city did the honorable thing in returning the check.""
???""We have been talking about cultural arts. But did they do it for 
something in return?"" asked Mayor Bill Griffin. ""The best thing we did was to 
return the check.""
???There wasn't anything improper about the gift, said Eric Thode, spokesman 
for Enron.
???""The city has a right to its opinion. I would say Enron nationwide has 
been recognized for its philanthropic activities. We want to be a good 
corporate citizen and support the community. These are not political 
contributions. Supporting cultural activities, children's activities, these 
are things we have typically supported in various areas where we do 
business,"" he said.
???When the company built a plant in Illinois, for example, it also built a 
playground in that city, Thode said.
???Two cities near the Pompano site, Margate and Coconut Creek, have 
expressed concern about the plant and air-quality regulators, worry it would 
rely too heavily on diesel fuel. Diesel fuel releases nitrogen oxide, a 
leading cause of smog, which can worsen asthma, bronchitis and other 
breathing problems. 
???The plant would burn diesel fuel up to 1,500 hours a year, according to 
its permit application to the state Department of Environmental Protection.
???Hargett said in his letter that he hopes when the plant controversy is 
over, and the timing is better, Enron will come through financially.
???""Hopefully, Enron will continue its support of the community and consider 
a future donation following completion of the various matters pending before 
the city,"" he wrote in his letter to Krimsky.
???Thode noted that the check was not written to the city.
???""We would not cut a check directly to a city government,"" he said. ""Our 
budget has standards.""
???The check was made payable to the non-profit Pompano Beach Cultural Arts 
Foundation, which raises money for city-sponsored cultural programs. The five 
city commissioners, who will vote on the power plant, act as the foundation's 
directors.
???Enron officials met with Coconut Creek City Manager John Kelly and his 
staff Thursday to discuss their concerns about the plant's impact. Because of 
the area's wind conditions, the gases from the plant's 80-foot stacks would 
blow in the general direction of Margate, Coconut Creek, Coral Springs and 
Parkland.
???Kelly said it was a ""good exchange of information"" and he expects future 
meetings.
???""They're trying to be the good neighbor and get into the community,"" Kelly 
said, referring to the returned check. ""It probably came off the wrong way.""
???He added that he was relieved Pompano Beach returned the money.
???""It gives us all a comfort level we're going to deal with it objectively,"" 
he said. ""Checks don't make the air better.""

_______________________________________________________________

Here are my comments on the draft received earlier today: (1) Sect. 1.9.
The second to last sentence in the definition of Cumulative Net Revenues
duplicates part (but not all) of the first sentence of Section 7.2 with
regard to what is included in Cumulative Net Revenue. (I don't believe the
language of Sect. 7.2 regarding the make-up of Cumulative Net Revenue is
intended to be only ""for purposes of Section 7.1"" as the wording of 7.2
suggests, so this could be confusing.) Perhaps the make-up of Cumulative
Net Revenue should be covered in just one place or, as an alternative, the
definition 1.9 could cross-reference 7.2. Also, the last sentence of 1.9 is
confusing. I believe this means the same thing as is stated expressly in
the last sentence of Sect. 7.2, i.e., ""Cumulative Net Revenues includes
uncollectable accounts receivable for which Peoples has assumed credit risk
pursuant to Section 2.10."" As I understand it, the second part of the
sentence means: ""Cumumlative Net Revenues shall not be adjusted to reflect
revenues refunded in accordance with Section 3.3, unless the refund is
attributable to (see my comment below re use of the word ""knowing"")
application by MEH, without the knowledge or consent of Peoples, of a rate
which exceeds the maximum rate allowed under Peoples' applicable FERC
Tariffs."" Perhaps we could state this more clearly in 1.9 or
cross-reference 7.2. (2) Sect. 3.3. I would delete part (i) if the last
sentence. It would be illegal and contrary to this Agreement for MEH (or
Peoples) to charge a rate above the maximum, so it seems inappropriate to
suggest that MEH can collect a fee for doing this. Also in this Section,
Part (ii) of the third sentence was modified to add the word ""knowingly"" to
describe the situation where MEH would be responsible to pay a refund.
Because this is not something MEH can legally do, it seems inappropriate to
have a provision addressing it. The Agreement can properly address the
responsibility for refund of an inadvertent overcharge, which is how I
interpreted this provision of 3.3 in the last draft. Perhaps we should just
make Peoples responsible for all refunds. Let me know what you think. (3)
Sect. 7.2. As indicated above, I am not sure that these provisions re
Cumulative Net Revenue are only ""for purposes of Section 7.1"". I would
suggest a clarification of how this works as indictaed in point 1 above.
Also, 6 lines from the end of 7.2, I think the reference to 7.2 (ii) is a
typo. I believe it's just 7.2.(4) Sect. 18.3. Do we want to include any
work related to the Governmental Approval as ""ordinary course""? If so,
there is some suggested language in an e-mail I sent dated Aug. 28. It
suggests a revision to item (vi).",,,Sect Peoples Cumumlative Net Revenues MEH FERC the Governmental Approval

	By James Covert 
	Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Despite an increasing emphasis on wholesale trading 
rather than asset ownership in its electricity operations, Enron Corp. (ENE, 
news, msgs) will continue to develop and purchase power plants, president 
Jeffrey Skilling told Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday. 
	""Generation assets are essential to a successful trading operation,"" Skilling 
said, responding to recent trade reports that the company plans to exit the 
power generation business. The Houston-based energy company is ""absolutely 
not"" selling its power plants as part of its strategy, he said. 
	Enron will continue to build and purchase natural gas-fired ""peaking plants,"" 
which produce power only during times of high demand and wholesale prices, 
Skilling said. 
	Enron has begun construction of a few such projects in the U.S. Midwest and 
South, and will continue development chiefly in the U.S and Europe, he said. 
	""The margins are higher (in wholesale power markets) in Europe,"" Skilling 
said. ""The market there is more fractional, and that creates more 
opportunities for someone who's playing across the board."" 
	Developments in Europe, particularly in southern Europe, also offer a higher 
per-unit rate of return, Skilling said. 
	Nonetheless, Skilling did confirm that the company isn't interested in 
building larger-sized plants in any country, and that its construction goals 
may not be as lofty as those of other energy companies. 
	""We are not interested in building base-load plants,"" Skilling said, 
referring to large power plants that produce power in steady quantities 
around the clock. 
	""Base load simply delivers megawatts - that's a bulky, undifferentiated 
commodity,"" Skilling said. ""But peaking plants allow us to play on the shape 
of the market of that commodity."" 
	Skilling declined to give any projections or figures related to Enron's 
future development plans, saying that they weren't set in stone. 
	But Skilling said the company generally aims to site power plants where there 
are bottlenecks in the transmission system, and that Enron isn't focused on 
any one geographic region as opposed to others. 
	""There are companies out there saying they're going to build 40,000 
megwawatts by such-and-such a date, and I don't really see how that's 
possible,"" Skilling said. ""There are just too many variables to approach 
markets like that.""

1306,"Ben,

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.

I look forward to your comments.

1311,"I think that is a great observation.  I would suggest that the language be 
fairly broad to include both potential assignees and potential 
investors/joint-venturers.  You might also consider anticipating some of our 
counterparties' concerns by including a provision like this  . . . . so long 
as such potential assignee or potential investor/joint venturer enters into 
an agreement to protect the confidentiality of such information.  This is an 
easy give because we always get a CA in place before disclosing information.  
I would steer clear of any modification to that provision which requires (i) 
a minimum term for the CA, (ii) agreement by the counterparty to the form of 
CA or (iii) the proposed assignee or potential investor to put itself in 
direct privity with the counterparty.

1346,"Hello - In order to cross one more item off of the enovate setup list, I 
would like to pursue the initial capital contribution required under the LLC 
agreement of $100,000 from each member.  Although we do not have loan 
facilities in place or final cash management protocol, I believe the initial 
funding can still take place.  If anyone has any other thoughts please let me 
know.  If not, I would like to schedule the initial funding for Friday, 
October 6th.  I believe that Mary Lynne will prepare the necessary vouchers

funding enovate, L.L.C.  Does ENA then fund Enron MW, L.L.C.? (Kay? Mary

As an update - Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4th to approve the 
risk management policy.  Assuming approval, enovate will be free to transact 
with third parties.  Therefore, depending on payment terms, money will begin 
flowing through the enovate account.  Therefore, any loan docs and service

         I sent to you and Kay by email yesterday morning, the initial plan
for the first phase of the discovery process along with time frames for
preparation and a request for authorization to proceed.   We would like to
issue the discovery as soon as reasonably possible after authorization,
given the relatively short time frame until the Pompano Beach hearing.   Kay
wants to discuss the discovery proposal and I expect that we will be doing
so sometime very soon.  (Kay, I am available all afternoon and also
available for most of the day tomorrow).   
        The discovery efforts proposed are independent of DEP.  Thus, we
will not be tied to or delayed by DEP, should the agency fail to undertake
the discovery that is needed.   Ryan Reetz of my office will be the lead
attorney responsible for that effort.   The petitioning municipalities and
Broward County agencies will likely conduct their own discovery, which may
include seeking to depose  Enron's experts and/or an Enron corporate
representative.   
        With respect to our experts, I had previously asked that Dave
Kellermeyer identify certain expert witnesses that we may need to sustain
the issuance of the permit.   By copy of this email, I am asking that Dave
contact me to advise me of the status of his efforts to date.

Form of consent to assignment agreement (draft circulated) - to be used for

soon:

follows:

a.   Tax language-  I have sent a prior version of Rev 4 jr to Matt G asking 
him to call me to let me know when he can talk with GE tax rep.  Steve Swifit 
and I are in London and would like to sit in on that call.

b.   Insurance Language review.   I sent same version to David Marshall and 
Paul Parrish asking for their reviews and opinion as to whether 7FA's are new 
technology.

c.   I ""volunteered"" to look at the termination language in world hunger, GE 
had some problems, and I had the same problem with the ARCOs contract.   I 
drafted a fix last Friday, sent to Kay M for comment.  I have included my 
suggested changes in the attached redline.  I have forwarded same fix to GE 
at end Friday for Arcos.    I have asked Kay if she still has a concern with 
the Limit of Liability as it relates to termination.  I think it works.

d.  I ""volunteered"" to work over Article 10, Exhibit B-3 and Exhibit B-6 in 
relation to Guarantees and liquidated damages.  I have done that in the 
attached redline of the T&C and Exhibits.

e. Some time ago I volunteered to resurrect the language associated with the 
reduction in the LD refund in Section 10.9.8.   I had sent out a couple weeks 
ago but received no reaction.    I have entered that fix in the attached 
redline.

f.  I have made several minor changes to definitions associated with 
performance.

Attached is Rev4-JR version of GE T&C's and Exhibits for world hunger.  They 
start from the clean rev 4 version of the T&Cs that Peter forwarded to me at 
my request.  The attached are redlined to show my changes.

I have not sent any of this to GE except for the termination language fix.   
I suggest that the Enron team give these a quick read before the World hunger 
call.  I can print same here and share with GE during the call unless there 
is an objection.  

I hope this will help to advance the process.  My earlier emails to Paul and

ignore those and for the above purposes use the attached files.

has a better chance of being executed in a timely manner, which is the

As for the termination agreement, here's what I suggest:



Do we want to address the purchaser's parent guaranty in both of the 
contracts, or just the consolidation agreement?  I would suggest that we make 
the guaranty a deliverable 30 days after execution of the contracts, which 
gives us time to get the Mitsui assignment done, as we expect to assign the 
contracts immediately.  That way, Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if 
necessary.  If ENA does provide the guaranty, we would want to have the 
ability to have it replaced with a suitable substitute guaranty from Mitsui.

1432,"Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side:
I haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times 
there are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency 
power to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would 
want the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to 
replace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get 
this agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).  
I would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you.
Interconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting 
transmission.  It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its 
network transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have 
to purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the 
plant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to 
supply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin 
Presto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's 
network transmission to delivery to third parties.
Is this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent 
rulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While 
VEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that 
you do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to 
transmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only 
way to ensure deliverability to third parties.
3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an 
increase.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other 
sources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission 
and subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on 
best/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase 
daily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of 
receipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as 
non-firm.)
12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that 
has not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since 
FERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant 
changes in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining 
transmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this 
contract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price 
covers that circumstance.
Underlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at 
most any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any 
current transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will 
pay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this 
contract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.

GO SPECIAL FORCES!!!

Special warriors' role: to terrorize terrorists

By STEPHEN HARRIMAN, The Norfolk Virginian-Pilot ? September 29, 2001

This week, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld told Americans and others
on a war watch not to expect a ``D-Day.'' In others words, don't look for
aircraft, ships and cruise missiles to suddenly light up the sky over
Afghanistan like they did in Baghdad in the first hours of the Gulf War.

Expect instead, the administration has been saying, a much more targeted
campaign aimed at ``smoking out'' individuals and cells of terrorists from
their mountainous hideouts.

Those who specialize in that sort of covert operation are the unconventional
warriors of the U.S. Special Operations Command. They are likely to play a
big role in this first war of the 21st century. Their mission will be to
terrorize the terrorists.

What follows is a profile of special operation forces -- units from the
Navy, Army and Air Force with a combined troop strength of between 45,000
and 50,000. The information was gleaned from publicly available material
including official Web sites.

The Army's 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (Delta Force),
headquartered in a remote section of sprawling Fort Bragg, N.C., is, like
the Naval Special Warfare Development Group (Dev Group), one of the U.S.
government's principal units charged with worldwide counter-terrorist
operations.

Both select experienced men from other special operation forces. There are
no women in special forces. Their methods of operation, too, are similar:
small groups, in and out quickly, often under the cover of darkness,
striking with speed, surprise and extreme violence.

Delta Force was created by Army Col. Charles Beckwith in 1977 in response to
numerous, well-publicized terrorist incidents in the 1970s. It is organized
into three operating squadrons, all of which are subdivided into small
groups known as troops, which can each be further divided into smaller units
as needed to fit mission requirements.

Delta also maintains support units which handle selection and training,
logistics, finance, and the units' medical requirements. Within this
grouping is a little-known but vital technical unit responsible for covert
eavesdropping and intelligence gathering.

Delta troopers are also equipped with the most advanced weaponry and
equipment available. A significant portion of their gear is highly
customized and cannot be found anywhere but in Deltas' lockers.

The Navy's Dev Group, based at the Navy facility at Dam Neck in Virginia
Beach, is an evolution of Seal Team 6, the existence of which the Navy has
never confirmed. Organization and manpower of the group is classified.
However, it is estimated that it now numbers approximately 200 operators.
There is also an administrative and testing section, which numbers
approximately 300 personnel.

It has been rumored that the unit maintains or has maintained a small number
of Black Hawk helicopters, but the majority of aviation requirements are
provided by the Army's 160th Special Operation Aviation Regiment, especially
in support of ship assaults, which frequently make use of the small MH-6
``Little Bird'' helicopters operated exclusively by the 160th.

The group is reportedly divided into five teams: Gold, Blue and Red for
assault, Gray for transportation and Black for reconnaissance and
surveillance; a sixth, the Green team, is for new personnel in training.

The Navy also brings to the table six Seal Teams with special covert
capabilities on sea, air and land. Teams 1, 3 and 5 are based at San Diego,
Teams 2, 4 and 8 at Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base. Each team has a
headquarters element and eight platoons (except for Seal Team 4, which has
10) of about a dozen men each, depending on the mission.

The Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) provides
aviation support to special operation forces. The Regiment consists of
modified Little Bird light observation helicopters, Black Hawk helicopters,
and Chinook medium-lift helicopters.

The regiment is trained to work in conjunction with other special operation
forces, especially to insert, extract and resupply them, and to conduct
armed escort, reconnaissance, surveillance, and electronic warfare in
support of their missions. Its focus on night operations resulted in the
nickname ``The Night Stalkers.''

Three battalions are based at Fort Campbell, Ky., home of the 101st Airborne
Division (Air Assault), and a fourth at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia. The
75th Ranger Regiment is the largest ground component of the special
operation forces. It is the premier airfield seizure and raid unit in the
Army. One of its first targets could be the large former Soviet base at
Bagram. The base, Afghanistan's only all-weather airfield, would make an
ideal forward operations base for special forces. The regiment is made up of
three 580-member Ranger battalions, based at Hunter Army Airfield, Fort
Lewis, Wash., and Fort Benning, Ga.

Each of the battalions has three 152-member rifle companies and a
headquarters element. Their capabilities include: infiltrating and getting
back out by land, sea, and air; conducting raids; recovery of personnel and
equipment, and conducting conventional or special light-infantry operations.

Ranger units have a limited anti-armor capability. Their only air defense
artillery system is the shoulder-fired Stinger missile. Ranger units
generally deploy with five days of supplies. The Army's Special Forces
soldiers (Green Berets) are carefully selected, specially trained, and
capable of extended operations in extremely remote and hostile territory.

``Foreign internal defense'' operations are designed to help friendly
developing nations by working with their military and paramilitary forces.
The Green Berets are likely to work with the various disaffected indigenous
people of the region to establish reliable intelligence.

The Special Forces Command is divided into five groups. The 5th Special
Forces Group (Airborne), based at Fort Campbell, focuses on Southwest Asia
and Northeastern Africa.

A Special Forces group has a headquarters element, a support element and
three battalions. Each battalion consists of 39 officers, 24 warrant
officers and 320 enlisted soldiers. A Special Forces company consists of
eight officers, seven warrant officers and 67 enlisted soldiers. Green
Berets are most frequently deployed in even smaller units called A
Detachments or teams of a dozen men. The Air Force 16th Special Operations
Wing is that service's major component in the U.S. Special Operations
Command, with a fleet of more than 90 aircraft, mostly MC-130s, that work
closely with Army and Navy forces in the support of unconventional warfare
missions.

Modifications to the MC-130 allow aircrews to perform clandestine missions
minimizing the chances of being detected by hostile radar systems.

The 352nd Special Operations Group, based in England, works with special
operation activities throughout the U.S. European Command and U.S. Central
Command. Other ground units that are trained to conduct similar covert
missions include Army Long Range Surveillance Units (LRSUs), the 10th
Mountain Division based at Fort Drum, N.Y., the 82nd Airborne Division based
at Fort Bragg, and the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) based at Fort
Campbell.

LRSUs are specially trained and equipped to collect human intelligence. They
observe and report enemy dispositions, movements and activities, and
battlefield conditions avoiding contact with the enemy and local civilians.

The 10th, 82nd and 101st divisions are large units that would be deployed
only if an extended ground war developed. All are light divisions and are
supposed to be deployed quickly; it took 60 days to deploy the 101st and all
its helicopters during the buildup to the allied strikes against Iraqi
forces in the Gulf War.

The Marines also have special training in special operations. Each deployed
Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) -- a reinforced battalion, a composite
aircraft squadron and a service support group with about 2,200 personnel --
is certified capable of special operations.

Each MEU contains a sub-unit whose tasks include deep reconnaissance and
surveillance, hostage rescue, and demolition.","STEPHEN HARRIMAN Donald H. Rumsfeld Charles Beckwith Fort

      As of today, El Paso's offer stands at $550m., and our value (Rod's and Corps.) stands at $800m.  Rod has been told by El Paso that the deal (if any) is on hold.  Due to the value gap, we're skeptical that we'd reach terms that we could submit to a Trustee.  As for the PSA, Staci has only prepared an outline of the necessary terms and has been told to slow play this one due to the value gap and El Paso's signal that this is on hold for the time being.
      If you'd like us to turn up the fire on this, we can.  I am a bit unclear (especially based on McMahon's comments on Sunday as to what is core, how we might restructure, and that asset sales were not on the front burner) as to what our key priorities are besides running the going concerns and preservation of value.

As I am sure you are aware, we are facing some significant challenges with

PG&E Gas Transmission Puts New Line in Service, Files 2003 Expansion 
PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) already has started deliveries through a 21-mile section of its 2002 mainline expansion project, and is making significant progress on proposed future expansions. The new 21-mile pipe section put into service last Friday increases the company's ability to deliver natural gas to western markets by 42,000 Dth/d a year earlier than expected and in time for the 2001 winter heating season. 
""We applaud the efforts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite the permitting process so that some of this new capacity could be in service before the winter heating season,"" said Thomas B. King, president and COO of PG&E National Energy Group's West Region, which includes subsidiary GTN. 
The new 42-inch pipe is in Spokane County, WA, and Kootenai County, ID, and represents the first installation of a third pipe, known as the C line, in GTN's mainline right of way. The new pipe became operational last Friday. GTN's 2002 Expansion Project also will include new 19,500 hp compressor units at five existing stations on the GTN mainline, which will increases its capacity by 220,000 Dth/d, mainly to serve power generation projects planned by Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine. Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. 
GTN also has filed with FERC for a certificate to build a second expansion for service commencing in the fall of 2003. The proposed 2003 expansion project would add another 143,000 Dth/d beginning in the fall of 2003, plus an additional 20,000 Dth/d of winter-only service. The 2003 expansion project calls for an additional 53 miles of new C line pipe, plus the installation of one 19,500 hp compressor unit on the mainline system. Combined, the 2002 and 2003 expansion projects would put the total GTN capacity at nearly 3,100,000 Dth/d. 
""The 2002 and 2003 expansion projects will provide much-needed natural gas transmission capacity to supply electric generation projects already in construction or advanced development in California and the Pacific Northwest,"" King said. 
In addition, GTN is exploring the possibility of building a pipeline lateral from its mainline system near Spokane, WA, to the Interstate 5 corridor near Seattle/Tacoma. The company has been in discussions with potential shippers about the Washington lateral project since an open season was completed in June 2001.  ""There is clearly market interest in this project,"" King said. ""We have successfully completed much of the initial feasibility studies for the Washington lateral project and are ready to move to development when the market indicates it is ready."" 
The GTN system went into service on Dec. 2, 1961, with initial capacity of 580,000 Dth/d. The original system, inaugurated as Pacific Gas Transmission Co., consisted of one 36-inch pipe, the A line. The mainline system grew over the last four decades, first through the addition of a second pipe, the B line, measuring 42-inches, and now with the beginning of the C line. The system includes 1,356 miles of pipeline along a 612-mile route which begins at the Idaho/British Columbia border, traversing through northern Idaho, southeastern Washington and central Oregon, and terminates at the Oregon/California border, where it interconnects with the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. pipeline system and Tuscarora Gas Transmission.

Subject: Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Fundraising

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously 
submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code 
and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into 
SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by 
Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically 
routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved 
(again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?

1510,"Hey Guys. 

We have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north. Right now 
Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule 12MW on the tie so do not try to 
schedule any more (The tie is only good for 17MW).

- Either do a export from SP15 to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at 
Silverpeak(From PV or FC).
- Buy transmission from SPP from  (www.swoasis.com ) CONTROL TO HILLTOP. 
($6.90 on-peak, $3.90 off-peak)
- Buy transmission from PAC from MAL2 TO MAL5. ($5.84)
- Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account 
numbers below).

We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin. 

THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY 
ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS 
SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. Call and confirm the request with both PAC 
and Sierra.



Also do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do 
not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I 
guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want 
competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they 
are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  

It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can.
If you have any questions over the weekend call me.

We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.

Sorry for the delay but Gerald and I were out all of last week and returned 
from vacation today.  

My understanding of the process is the counterparty applies for 
access/password with the password application....he's approved and given an 
USERID and password....and then when he accesses the site for the 1st time, 
the software will route him to the OUA which he must agree to on-line before 
he is allowed to carry out operations/nominations through the website.  On 
subsequent visits to the site the software will recognize that the 
Counterparty has previously agreed to the OUA and will not route him 
automatically to the agreement.  

In response to your questions:
(1) The check verification option (exchange or view access) has been deleted 
from the password application
(2) My understanding was that the site would be used only by current HPL 
customers with existing contracts, if that's not the case we need to tweak 
the agreement.
(3) The formatting errors have been corrected.

We'll discuss at our meeting tomorrow at 9:00a.m.  Thanks,

I wanted you both to have the following information: (i) the legal/regulatory research questions that the Upstream Storage Group (Paul Bieniawski, Miguel Vasquez & Eva Rainer) have posed to LeBoeuf Lamb (law firm) and Brown Williams (rate consultant) and (ii) the two Reports produced in response to such questions.  The Reports were delivered to the Storage Group personnel Friday, July 27, 2001, and were forwarded to me by Bob Neustaedter last Friday, August 3, 2001.  

The cost of this work was borne jointly by Jean Mrha's Upstream Group and the Regulatory Affairs Group; Donna Fulton, Sarah Novosel, and Bob Neustaedter are the Regulatory/Governmental Affairs individuals involved in retaining Brown Williams and in recommending Larry Acker at LeBoeuf to conduct the legal/regulatory research.  I reviewed the engagement letters on behalf of the Regulatory Affairs Department.  The combined cost of these reports is about $100,000.

I've done the best I can to be sure that the Upstream Storage Group does not ""overlook"" the Legal Department as it forges ahead into a transactional arena fraught with significant regulatory and accounting risks and traps.  Gerald, as you have become involved with the development scenarios that involve a compression component, I think it would be wise to become familiar with the contents of both the LeBoeuf Lamb and Brown Williams Reports.

If either of you would like to discuss the legal, regulatory or political implications of the attached, please feel free to give me a call.

1612,"By now you have probably heard about three memos that discuss questionable trading strategies at Enron involving the California market. The memos were brought to the Board's attention several days ago, and the Board voted on Sunday to waive the attorney-client privilege with respect to those documents. On Monday, we turned the memos over to the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission and other appropriate agencies. There are likely to be a number of investigations into this issue, and as we have with all current investigations, we will cooperate fully with these efforts. If you should be contacted in regard to this matter, I encourage you to contact Bob Williams in our legal group at 713-345-2402.

Master contracts that were not in Enfolio II format. The spreadsheet attached

determine where we might want to replace the old version contracts with new 
Enfolios (especially with the potential trade volume out on EOL). This was 
not stated to be a 'hot item', but with the potential exposure on EOL it was

1618,"Debra:

As Debra and I discussed, we are  currently preparing a GISB contract for GPU 
Services Company, as agent for ______.  I mentioned to Debra that when we 
have a counterparty who is represented in transactions by an agent, we  work 
to include the attached agency riders in the master agreement.  These riders 
include reps and warranties relating to the agent's authority as well as an 
acknowledgment by the principal relating to same.  I propose that you all 
consider the attached riders when preparing master agreements in an agency 
context.  

To the extent that the counterparty is amenable, I strongly urge you to 
propose that the principal enter into the contract on its own behalf and that 
the contract merely recite that the agent is authorized to enter into 
transactions pursuant to the agreement for and on behalf of the principal.  
This is the approach I am going to try with GPU.  If an agent represents 
multiple principals, try to enter into a separate master with each principal. 

However, to the extent the counterparty absolutely refuses this approach, at 
the very least I would include the riders and get acknowledgments from the 
principal(s).  If there are multiple principals, try to get a separate 
agreement with the agent for each principal (as opposed to one master with an 
agent on behalf of numerous principals) to avoid questions about allocation 
of transactions and credit exposures.

Please feel free to follow up with any questions or comments.

I have also attached for your reference a memorandum I prepared some time ago 
regarding various issues to consider when dealing with an agency relationship.

Just to clarify, Enron's international business model and North American business model are quite different.   I work in the Enron North American business unit which has been extremely profitable and has pioneered the deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in the US.   Enron NA's focus has been on creating efficient wholesale markets in gas, power, crude, pulp & paper, metals, etc and then providing the market with a logistical delivery and price risk management intermediation function.   We are very cost effective in this function because we achieve huge scale and scope in the market with minimal fixed costs.

Enron's international business model, on the other hand, entailed constructing capital intensive infrastructure power and gas projects with leveraged project financing (with project financing supported by long term sales to government utilities).   This model is OK provided the business risk, currency risk, international risk, change in law risk, legal risk, etc. is priced properly by the debt and equity providers.

I will let you conclude which business model is better.   I think you will see Enron applying our successful NA model into the international markets that have an economy and regulatory environment that supports a ""free-market"" model.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

1646,"yeah! it IS you.

and alaska in july with rodney yee! i'm jealous. i haven't taken a class
with him, but many months ago i checked out some of his videos from the
public library. i don't use the videos anymore, given that i like going to
actual classes so much more, but it was a good way to ease back into
practicing. i would love to take a class with him. whenever i check the
schedule for piedmont yoga though, he's off in some far-flung place. maybe
i'll just have to do one of the workshops with him someday...when exactly is
the one in alaska?

here, i usually go to the mill valley yoga studio, which is close to my
house. there are 2 teachers there who i really like. they're very different,
which is part of what i like. one sounds like your portland teacher. the
other is more gentle. there's also another one who is such a lively spirit
that her classes are fun and invigorating, even if less focused or rigorous.

it sounds like you've gotten quite serious about yoga. do you practice every
day?

my brother scott (who i think you met once) also does a lot of yoga. now
that he's moved back here from new mexico, after a sad divorce, i'm always
trying to get him to talk with some of the cute, sexy women in the yoga
classes, but, like you, he's very  shy....

speaking of which, being ""a fool"" is a good thing in my book, if by that you
mean romantic and dreamy. but just remember, bold fools have more fun. do
you remember that borges poem i had on my desk? the one that started (in
translation): ""if i had my life to live over again, i'd make more
mistakes..."" and then there's goethe, who wrote the oft-quoted:  ""whatever
you dream you can do, begin it. boldness has genuis, power and magic in it.
begin it now.""

anyway...i'm babbling, as i'm prone to do. i'll write again soon and promise
to answer more of your questions (i.e. about my work, jake's activities,
etc.). in the meantime, i need to get back to work.

i will definitely stay in touch. we miss seeing you too. wouldn't it be
great to have dinner again at that old picnic table outside, overlooking a
garden in its prime? (to answer one more question, i do have a garden now, a
small one, but it's in shade much of the day, so it's full of flowers rather
than veggies. it's also got a large redwood and an inviting hammock
underneath. and this time, instead of lily the dog as frequent visitor, we
get oscar the cat).

keep watering those plants.

=)

love,

jules

only that.....he's good for a laugh.  The guy who loves Hawaiin shirts and 
loves to cycle - interesting combination.  He's also a big-league fundraiser, 
and has now just crossed the $20,000 mark.  My wish for you is that you get 
to $6,000 so that you can can enjoy the Tour of Champions in Sedona with Dan 
and the gang.  It'll be a trip you'll never forget -- the mountain biking 
maybe -- but the Hawaiin shirts never!  100 miles or 50 miles - your choice 
for this weekend.

Saturday - April 8

    1. The 100-mile ride will start at 8:00 AM sharp from Tomball Middle 
School/Jr. High on FM2920(which is the main street of Tomball) about a mile 
east of TX249. To get there either take TX 249 north to FM 2920 and turn 
right and go about a mile east or take I45 North to FM 2920 and go west until 
you hit Tomball and go through town to the start point.  It will go north 
through Egypt and Honea up to Montgomery and then north and west to Richards 
in Grimes County via the Sam Houston National Forest.  It will then loop west 
and south coming back via Dacus and Dobbin.  This century will get you ready 
for the big ride. 

   2. The main ride will be a fairly hilly century, designed to get you ready 
for the150 the following weekend, but the map provided at the start will also 
show a 50 mile route that is only lightly hilled.

P.S. - Dan won't be in the office this week, so if you have any questions, 
too bad!  Just kidding - call me and I'll see if I can help.

Peter",,,
1670,"I know the following goes without saying, but I wanted to highlight a few 
specific points relevant to this transaction.

As all of you know, the sale of Brownsville and Caledonia to Cinergy was 
recently announced.  As the press release indicated, the terms of the 
transaction were not released.  While Allegheny (with the sale of the 2000s) 
took the same position in its announcement, the purchase price was 
subsequently released to the market (by Allegheny).  Cinergy and Enron both 
agreed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, to not release the price and terms 
without the other's consent (i.e. THE PRICE AND TERMS WILL REMAIN 
CONFIDENTIAL). 

To the extent legally permitted, Cinergy will not release the price as part 
of its regulatory filings, and in fact, will redact the price from all of its 
filings.  If, through your involvement in this process, you inadvertently 
learned the price, you must keep it to yourself.  As we all know, information 
moves around this organization very quickly.  With two deals on very similar 
assets in the market at once (Allegheny and Cinergy), it only makes sense to 
contain the external flow of information.

By the way, both transactions should close March/April 2001.

Thanks for your help in this process, and your co-operation in keeping this 
information confidential.

1. 11x17 map showing Tennessee routing through Colonial system
2. 8x14 map showing the various upgrades under discussion w/Boston Gas
3. recent information from Boston Gas on capacity/delivery pressure from BG.


Our understanding/expectation is that Tennessee will be increasing its line
pressure to accomadate potential back hauls now that Maritimes is tied in.  
The
expected pressure on TGP is expected to rise over 600 psi.  This will have a 
big
impact on deliverability.  Colonial serves ULP by drawing from Tennessee at
Tewksbury, and also has a LNG facility at that site.  In order to ensure that
LNG can always be injected into their system, BG needs to regulate pressure to
no more than 600psi at the city gate.  Currently the line is running from 
300psi
to 600psi throughout the year.

Can you confirm our assumptions?

We are looking at the various options, but clearly option 3 looks best.  We 
will
be sending follow up questions tomorrow on quality of service (pressure drop,
""firm"" service), throughput charges, and other clarifications.

We are asking BG for a meeting date next week, on either March 29 or 30; we

1685,"Hey Ben,

How is life in Texas?  Have you met that guy Rob McDonald I know from DC?
He is good friends with my cousin Eddy Quinn.  Life has gotten rather boring
out here. We have a ton of work to do and work long hours with no days off.
This work style in the beginning made time fly but recently the monotony of
the routine has gotten mundane.  We all live for port calls and push the
envelope of ethical billing while in port.  I have been shot down by every
school I applied for.  How about you?  They can all blow me as I would
probably outperform all of those faggots with high GMATs.  That has been my
achilles heel.  Right now I am focused on the summer and getting off this
ship.

I hope I get in the marathon because I have been training for so long.
There is nothing else to do except that in my free time.  If I don't have a
goal to shoot for then I could never keep up this training on land.  The
summer will be the hardest because I am going to want to travel and visit
people when I get back.  Any plans to be in NY this summer?

I have been messing around with stocks too.  I have made only a little since
the tech crash.  I stay away from those Internet companies so I didn't get
killed.  See you in the summer.

1708,"Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball

Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We 
should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I 
definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we 
bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a 
pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer 
combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA 
economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way 
to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels 
where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  
price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so 
this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of 
course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. 
of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most 
other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an 
increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so 
you could take it with
a grain of salt.

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved (again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

had given me).  Beatty demurred.  Renfrew is still out of the country  and
will be until the 22nd of January.

For scheduling purposes, be advised I have just been re-set for trial in
another case on February 26, so we need to avoid that week for the hearing.

Thanks for the quick response yesterday regarding my previous ""e mail"".  Since the NYMEX has just announced that they are going to continue the shortened trading hours (10:45 to 1:45 PM Eastern Time) for next week I was wondering what the AGA's plans are for releasing the Storage Report for the week ending September 21, 2001.
Since the normal release time is 2:00 PM Eastern Time this release will be after the NYMEX Close.  This will be especially critical since Wednesday September 26, 2001 is the Settlement Day for the October NYMEX contract.  Which means it is the last day the October contract will trade.  The Storage information will be very important to the Market.  Delaying it until Thursday would not be prudent in my mind.  Since we are aware of this situation today I would think all involved would want to decide early what is to be done and to inform all Industry Participants on Monday September 24, 2001 so that everyone has ample time to prepare for whatever is decided.  Your help is very much appreciated.

RE:  Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day


Please be reminded that Thursday, May 31, 2001, is the First Notice Day, for
the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of June 2001
(the new spot month).

On Wednesday, May 30, 2001, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all Brokers and
Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"")
system trained representative available until such time as the Exchange
deems necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a
diligent effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to show due
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

The issue which we discussed is authority.  The Merced resolution of March

provide appropriate information, and certifications for completing Master 
Trading (ISDA) Agreements with energy vendors and execute Master Trading 
(ISDA) Agreements and appropriate vendor Schedules to the ISDA Agreement for 
the purpose of acquiring energy and stabilizing energy costs.  Such 
executions are subject to Counsel review of the agreement and schedules as to 
form.""  There is no specific mention of authority to enter into transactions 
(by Merced's traders).
Intuitively one could draw the conclusion that the ISDA Master contemplates 
transactions, Merced authorized the ISDA Master and therefore Merced 
authorized transactions under the ISDA Master.  Since Merced is a 
governmental entity, the safer view is that we should not assume that Merced 
authorized transactions.  Merced probably intended to authorize transactions, 
and if so, should not have an issue with specifically providing a clarifying 
resolution.

Tony Soter: Return of an Oregon Native 
 by Cole Danehower, Oregon Wine Report
Tony Soter is one of the most respected winemakers in the business. His consulting clients have included such elite California labels as Araujo Estate, Niebaum-Coppola, Dalla Valle, Moraga Vineyards, Spottswoode, and Viader Vineyard-not to mention his own Pinot noir-focused creation, Etude Winery (recently sold to Beringer Blass).

 NW Wine of the Week from Andy Perdue: Powers Parallel 46
 This affordable red blend was ranked No. 1 last week at the annual Pacific Northwest Wine Fair in Toronto. Other wines in the judging included 97 Ridge Montebello, 1998 Hedges Red Mountain Reserve, Gordon Brothers Tradition, and pepper Bridge Cabernet Sauvignon. At $30, the Powers wine was the least expensive of the entrants! Gorgeous bottle, too.

 Chris Camarda's delicious and hard to get Merlots- 2000 vintage is  made from ""his best fruit ever"".
Robert Parker says of Chris's wines: ""Andrew Will's wines have virtually perfect tannins. They are present but buffered by the loads of dominating sweet fruit. Furthermore, what is amazing about Chris Camarda's wines is that they are concentrated yet grateful. Camarda's (wines) blend power with elegance, concentration with finesse, and supersweet fruit with definition. Chris Camarda is a brilliant winemaker.""

they are going to fax it on Monday when the requisite operations person 
returns.  Once this last statement is executed on Monday they will be able to 
stall the equipment.  

They further indicated that, in practical terms, there overnight should not 
cause any further delay because they are just shipping the equipment today

1793,"Hey Stephanie, we need to revise this list because it does not make sense at 
least with respect to ENA.  It does not list key people (e.g. Gary) and it is 
inconsistent with the resolutions.  For example, the resolutions say that a 
managing director and treasurer can be a designated person to open an account 
but ENA does not have such an officer.  There are MD's and then there is a VP 
and Treasurer.  There are I think other inconsistencies we need to clear up 
to avoid having the accounts invalidated.  Having these points clear is 
especially important where, like now, we won't have Gary or Mark Frevert sign 
because they are out of town and we need to open the account right away.  

I know you are swamped so I will work tonight on revising the List for ENA 
tonight and give the revisions to do first thing in the morning.

Can you revise the List for ECT today (or just doublecheck it) so that we do 
not have a hold up in executing the Goldman International account for ECT 
first thing in the morning.  I promised Sheila Glover we would execute it 
right away.

Did we open any ENA accounts in the past two weeks and if so, just to be 
clear, can we send them a list that includes Gary's name and title if he 
signed.

1795,"Re the inquiries directed to me in your Raptor Memo distributed this 
afternoon, I understand that the option to purchase up to 535,715 shares of 
Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. Class B Preferred Stock granted under the 
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement in the 1997 Catalytica transaction, as 
modified by the September 2000 Omnibus Agreement to provide for its cashless 
exercise for CCSI common stock only on a 1 for 1 basis ( assuming no 
adjustments for CCSI recapitalization and the like under the adjustment 
provisions in the Stock Purchase Agreement occur prior to the exercise ), is 
to be included in the Raptor transaction. I'm not sure I'm the party to say 
whether it should be or not, however. 

I noted in a memo received earlier today from Stuart Zisman that the option 
shares were not included in the shareholdings total in that memo, and perhaps 
a separate memo will be prepared for the option itself as it is my 
understanding the option or the shares underlying it are part of our 
valuation of the CCSI holdings. I was advised prior to finalizing the Omnibus 
Agreement that the CCSI shares and the option are held by Sundance Assets, 
L.P., an Enron affiliate and transferee from Enron Ventures, Inc. ( the party 
to the 1997 Stock Purchase Agreement).

The Stock Purchase Agreement, the Omnibus Agreement and CCSI's pending form 
S-1 registration statement ,filed last week with the SEC, and CCSI's parent's 
form of merger proxy statement, also filed with the SEC last week, all have 
been forwarded to Sara. The SEC filings were required in connection with the 
contemplated spin off of Cataltyca's CCSI holdings to Cataltyica's 
stockholders in connection with the acquisition of Cataltyica by DSM, 
anticipated to be closed by year end or shortly thereafter.

The following items are outstanding issues with respect to the 
above-referenced ISDA:

1. Arizona Public Service Company plans on executing the ISDA as Arizona 
Public Service Company, on behalf of its Bulk Power Marketing Resource 
Operations Division (""BPMROD"").  It is APSC's intent in the future to create 
a new entity for this division, such new entity to enter into all trading 
transactions.  As a result, it is ASPC's desire to  modify the definition of 
""Specified Transaction"" to only include transactions between Party A and 
BPMROD.

2. Procedures for Entering into Transactions - ASPC would like 5 days to 
dispute or accept confirmations.  Apparently, all of their agreements provide 
for 5 days, therefore any shorter time period could cause problems for them.  
I had previously offered 3 days.

3. Part 5 (f) Recording - ASPC wants to consent to recordings on ""trading 
lines only"".  They do not want to consent to officers (non-traders) being 
recorded if the communication does not occur on a trading line.

4. Part 5 (g)(B) - Setoff -  ASPC wants to delete ""or any of its Affiliates"" 
from this section.  ASPC thinks this issue is related to their issue in #1 
above.  I don't see why.  What do you think?  I assume that we are not 
willing to strike ""or any of its Affiliates"".

The only other issue is a credit issue which I am handling with Paul Radous.  
So, we're close.  Let me know what you think.

Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.  

To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th

appear to be the flavor of the day counterparty.  Has a decision been made to 
only have one ISDA master between Barep and ENA and to the extent Europe 
wants to trade with Barep we will back to back the trade through ENA to 
ECTRIC?  I would rather do this than have two masters in place with the same 
counterparty.  In the US we do not use novation agreements we use assignment 
agreements.  I know several years ago when I worked at Salomon I had to use 
novation agreements with UK counterparties because of some oblique tax 
problem, is this still a requirement?  

I am attaching a general form of assignment agreement used by the swap group 
if that form is acceptable otherwise I am sure Paul has an appropriate form.

1822,"Deregulation not to blame but Davis is: His inaction allowed a problem to 
become a power, and fiscal, crisis
By Pete Wilson 
(Published June 3, 2001) 

The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of 
hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a 
sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand. Five years ago, when 
deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature 
(and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer, 
including then-Lt. Gov. Gray Davis), California enjoyed an excess of supply 
over demand amounting to some 30 percent. 
Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition; first, to drive 
down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and, 
second, to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new 
generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and 
keep in California all the jobs that it would produce. 
And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in 
applications to build power plants, especially after the effective date of 
the legislation in 1998 and the defeat that year by California voters of 
Prop. 9 (which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation). The total megawattage 
of the filings for 1998 doubled that for 1997. After the effective date 
(March 1998) of the deregulation legislation, AB 1890, and the defeat of 
Proposition 9 (November 1998), removing the threat of repeal, the total for 
1999 was double that of 1998 -- exceeding the 5,000 MW mark in '99 alone. 

Just look at the filings for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 in the California 
Energy Commission graph (above). Far from causing the problem of energy 
shortage, as the Davis administration charges, deregulation caused providers 
to file -- by mid-2000 -- applications to build new power plants that 
promised to add 10,000 megawatts to California's power supply. 
That's why I signed it. 
I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB 1890 -- 
just as I (and every other governor in history) signed other bills which, 
though imperfect, promised significant and needed beneficial change from the 
status quo, which was certainly true of deregulation. 
No one could have anticipated in 1996 the combination of factors -- less 
hydroelectric output in the West, warmer summers, sharply higher electricity 
demand, constraints on natural gas supply -- that turned an electricity 
surplus into an electricity problem by 2000. The reason we will suffer power 
blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction 
allowed a problem to become a crisis. Now the power crisis threatens to 
become a state fiscal crisis. 
Governor Davis has been quoted as saying, ""If I wanted to raise rates, I 
could have solved this problem in 20 minutes."" Sadly, by temporizing on 
needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis, he 
made crisis inevitable. As a result, California bonds have suffered two 
downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies, and he has put in jeopardy state 
spending for parks, schools, transportation and other capital needs. He has 
been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state 
budget. 
The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in 
electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years, which 
gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation, or 
the curtailment of production of natural gas, which led to price spikes in 
recent years. It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting 
agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century. 
It ignored a 1998 warning by the California Energy Commission of possible 
energy shortages by as early as 2000. And when possibility became hard, hot 
reality in San Diego in 2000, it continued to ignore it, putting in place a 
political, palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem. 
Fully a year ago, or earlier had he chosen to do so, Governor Davis could 
have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of 
California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency, including 
explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy. These powers 
include the suspension of statute and regulation. It was this power that I 
used after the Northridge earthquake in 1994 to rebuild and reopen Los 
Angeles' shattered freeways -- just 64 days after their destruction, instead 
of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required 
by law. 
Fully a year ago, Davis could have acted unilaterally, without the 
Legislature, to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investor-owned 
utilities (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) recently complain of but eagerly requested at 
the time of enactment. 
He could have, by decree, suspended the provision that prohibited the 
utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers. 
He could have, by executive order, suspended and truncated the nightmarish 
process required by state law for approval of siting. Had he done so early 
enough, when he might even have made a difference this summer, and done so 
not just with peaker plants but also with large plants, he might have greatly 
accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow 
us to escape from blackouts, power price spikes and the severe job loss and 
economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither 
reliable nor affordable. 
All these actions, Governor Davis could have taken a year ago -- or earlier: 
A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to 
prevent it. He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it. 
Had the governor heeded the early warnings -- about hot weather, or the 
threat of insolvency to the utilities -- and had he acted, using the full 
range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have, he could 
have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become. 
We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast 
enough to avoid blackouts this summer. 
PG&E would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern 
California Edison would not be teetering on the brink. 
Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels. 
The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers' dollars. 
And California's jobs would not be threatened, as they are, by raiders from 
other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California 
employers to their states and steal our jobs. 
The blame game waged by the governor's office adds insult to injury. It will 
provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer. But it 
does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to 
mislead those who are not aware of the real, unhappy facts of California's 
present crisis. 
The honest explanation for it is simple, not rocket science: State government 
cannot ignore the law of supply and demand. It is not the state's 
responsibility to build power plants. But it is its responsibility to create 
a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers 
to do so. Deregulation, even with imperfections that the governor could have 
cured by fiat if the need arose, was a significant advance in achieving that 
incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest. 
The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of 
Governor Davis' failure to act. That is the plain, unhappy truth of the 
matter. I take no joy in saying so. I have been prepared to be helpful to the 
governor during this very serious challenge to our state's well-being, just 
as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition 
39 (the school bond issue) in the most recent election. 
Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him 
then, I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and 
a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in 
order to shift the blame for his own inaction.

regulatory person in Toronto.  We are leaning towards starting with a new 
face.  Give me a call to discuss.

1826,"Today, FERC Staff held its conference to discuss what regulatory changes are 
necessary to promote further market liquidity.  The conference was fairly 
well attended by FERC staff, including Dan Larcamp and  Shelton Cannon.  

Some common themes:
Gas markets are generally well functioning and major changes are not 
necessary.
Commodity markets are very liquid.
FERC policies, GISB and Order 637 have helped to make capacity markets more 
liquid.
Shippers are unhappy with tighter tolerances and new balancing services in 
Order No. 637 compliance filings.
Standardization is necessary to promote liquidity (with pipelines making the 
distinction that standardization of transactional protocols is a good idea, 
standardization of product offerings is not).
There is very little consensus on further areas for change.  In nearly every 
case, a change advocated by one shipper group is opposed by another.  
In any event, most said that now is not the time for sweeping changes.

Areas without consensus:
Shipper-must-have-title rule.  LDCs argue it should be removed; while Process 
Gas and producers think that removal will undermine the capacity release 
market.
Production area rate design.  LDCs argued that they need the ability to buy 
service downstrream of a market pool.  Reliant and Koch also argued that 
pipelines should have to have separately stated production and market rates.  
The producers opposed any attempt to shift costs to the production area.
SFV.  East Coast LDCs, Michcon, and APGA argued for moving off of SFV.  The 
producers and industrials oppose.  Illinois Power/Dynegy also argued for 
moving off SFV.  


LDC Positions
The LDCs main themes were removing the shipper-must-have-title and enabling 
LDCs to hold space downstream of market centers.  However, they also argued 
that  pipelines should not be permitted to offer new services to the electric 
generation market that reduce the flexibilities LDCs have historically 
enjoyed since the system was built for LDCs .   This is the point that AGA 
raised in the blanket intervention to all Order 637 compliance filings.    
Carl Levander of Columbia did a nice job of refuting the notion that LDCs are 
entitled to unwritten flexibility that they have enjoyed in the past on a 
best efforts basis, perhaps in part due to the fact that the pipeline may not 
have been fully subscribed.  LDCs, generally stating that 637 compliance 
filings did a poor job of allowing capacity segmentation, continued to stress 
the need for segmentation, including ""geographical segmentation of ROFR 
capacity.""  

Some Specific Proposals
NGSA called for more targeted information to be included in Form 2 filings.  
A number of customer groups noted the need for more and better information, 
though specific needs were not well defined.
Several parties ask FERC to reconsider national standardized penalties 
(especially given expected high prices this winter and the possibility for 
arbitrage).
Alliance of Energy Suppliers (marketing arm of EEI) called for a dialogue 
between power generators and INGAA to develop a new firm tariff with hourly 
variability.  They also called for a change in GISB nomination deadlines to 
match the power grid (Dan Larcamp asked whether EEI is open to efforts to 
standardize scheduling times across the power grid as well).
The GISB End-User group (represented by Salt River Project)  complained about 
the need to standardize the confirmation process and called for gas 
transactions to be ""tagged"" like electric transactions.  

E-Commerce and Capacity Trading
Dave Neubaurer did a great job of driving home the themes that capacity 
trading can occur if FERC and industry are willing to allow more speedy 
transactions, remove posting periods and long contract execution periods.  He 
made an effective case that no major regulatory changes are necessary.  
Robert Levin of the NY Mercantile Exchange echoed this theme, admonishing the 
FERC not to micro-manage the types of trading platforms or to try to insist 
on a single platform.  He said that liquidity cannot be legislated.  From his 
perspective, natural gas markets are the best functioning commodity markets 
in the world.  FERC should worry about transferring the ""good stuff"" from 
natural gas to electric markets, not the reverse.",Dan Larcamp Shelton Cannon Koch Carl Levander Dave Neubaurer Robert Levin,,"FERC Staff FERC GISB APGA SFV Illinois Power/Dynegy AGA Columbia ROFR

Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission issued a staff report on electricity restructuring issues.  It is an update of the July 2000 report done at the request of House Energy Chairman Tauzin and Subcommittee Chairman Barton.  They requested the report be updated.  A summary of the report and the full 80+ page text is on the FTC web site at www.ftc.gov on the upper left side of the home page.

I read the summary and will read the balance.  So far, so good.  It basically says that even states that have opened up to retail competition are in transition with a hybrid of regulation and competition, thus the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged.  However, the report states that nothing to date indicates that competition, once the transition period is over, will not produce additional benefits for consumers.  The report's major conclusion is that competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets.  

The summary includes something that sounds promising on RTO policy, saying ""And as wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful.""",Tauzin Barton,,the Federal Trade Commission House Energy FTC
1828,"Unlike TX, creditworthiness standards for Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers (ARES) in IL is not uniform accross utility lines. The creditworthiness standards vary by utility, and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES. However, the single billing option (SBO) has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria. All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative.

Enron's Credit Rating of BBB(S&P), and Baa2(Moody's)
General Creditworthiness: Under Section 451.50 Subchapter C of the IL Admin. Code, as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement. In IL, EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of 1MW or more. To secure this license, EES was required to post bond in the sum of $30,000. The bond is valid for one year, and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES. If the license bond is cancelled, modified, expires or is drawn upon, EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond, such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount. The EES license bond expired on June 2001. EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June 2002, and annually thereafter.

Registration Under SubPart B:
EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section 451.100 - expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only non-residential customers with maximum demand of  1MW or more. Subpart B has additional financial qualifications
	1. To maintain certification under Subpart B, EES needs to maintain at least one of the following long-term credit ratings of BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody's), BBB- (Duff 	& Phelps), or BBB- (Fitch); or

	2.  Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings. The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall 
	not be less than $500,000 or 5% of EES' revenue for last fiscal year; or
	
	3. Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC, in an amount not less than  	$500,000 or 5% of EES's revenue for the last fiscal year; or

	4. Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES' contractual failure. This certification shall be 	covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC in the sum of 1080 times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next 12 months, multiplied by the 	average of the 45 highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year; or
	
	5. EES maintains a  line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of $500,000 or 5% of its revenue for last fiscal year, from an ""A"" rated financial 	insitution; or
	
	6. EES earns 12 points on the financial ratios - pre-tax interest coverage, funds from operations interest coverage, funds from operations to total debt, and total debt 	to total capital.

Enron's Credit Rating and downgrades: To satisfy the Subpart B requirements, EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp. Given our current credit rating of BBB(S&P) and Baa2 (Moody's), that guaranty is still valid. However, if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level, EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness.

IMPACT: The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EES's ability to do business in IL. Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license. This will trigger contractual default for all our customers, both financial and physical. Please note that, EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP.

Single Bill Option:
Pursuant to Section 451.500, Subpart F, any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option (SBO), must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities, monies that it collects under the SBO tariff. To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards, EES must either:
	1. Post and maintain bond in the amount of 15% of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO

	2. Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an ""A"" rating

	3. Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings, a BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody's), BBB-(duff &Phelps, BBB- (Fitch)
	
	4. Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings.
Enron's Current Rating: EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff. This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in 3, or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings. EES is not rated. However, given Enron Corp's current credit rating of BBB and Baa2, a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff. 

Further Downgrades: If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings, EES will need to provide a bond or LC, or forego the SBO option.

IMPACT: EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES. Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical. However, there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation, particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables.

Instrument Fund Charges: (akin to stranded costs)
Under the Illinois tariffs, EES can choose annually, one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges. (1) To remit IFC charges within 7 days of receipt of customer payment, or more frequently as required; or (2) within 15 days of utility invoicing, whether or not customer has paid. If EES chooses the 2nd option, it has to provide a security deposit equal to one month's estimated IFC charges for all EES' customers. Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage, and the IFC charge per KWH. If the expected IFC charge for EES' customers is $5,000,000 or more, this deposit amount will be revised monthly.

If EES chooses the 2nd option - remittance of bills within 15 days of utility invoicing, we will be required to provide the deposit.

IMPACT: This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd. For ComEd, IFC charges nets out to zero, and customers do not pay those charges. EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IP's service territory, and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement. If EES chooses the first remittance option, it will avoid the deposit requirement. However, this may have operational implications.",Baa2,"30,000 less than $500,000 500,000 5,000,000",Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers ARES SBO Enron Credit Rating the IL Admin EES Moody's Fitch LC IL Enron Corp.

1840,"Hey Guys,
I probably will need one more spot.  We have been talking about moving Cora into a little different position so that she can handle the Peoples and Chicago office activity.  This means that I will need another scheduler to replace her.  Hunter/Laura do you want Cora with the traders or with the schedulers?  I have told Rain already and have put the spot with the schedulers.  Let me know if you need something different.

KUDLOW'S TAKE
By Lawrence Kudlow

TEMPERING THE TERMINATOR
There's more to making money, Alan.


July 23, 2001 8:35 a.m.



Alan Greenspan went through his Terminator III act last week, pledging to
the Congress and the nation that he and the Federal Reserve will do all that
it takes to finance economic recovery. Of course, the heavyweight central
banker has already reneged on his earlier forecast that recovery would come
in the second half. It's now July, which begins the second half, and there
is no recovery.

And, in a rare moment of candor, he told the House Financial Services
Committee that the U.S. economy is ""not out of the woods yet."" So the great
monetary leader left the door wide open for additional easing moves.

During his testimony Greenspan was especially proud of Fed efforts to
reignite money-supply growth as a pro-recovery measure. This is a good
thing, because it was the Fed's massive deflation of money last year that
completely leveled the stock markets and put us in the fix we are in today.

The trouble with all this macho money-creation is that you can lead a horse
to water but you can't make him drink. While the Fed is beginning to pump
more high-powered cash into the economy, a public that is still reeling from
the after-effects of stock-market shock refuses to put any of that money to
productive use in the economy. Investors recoiling from a vicious 70% NASDAQ
drop, and an even worse total wipe out of the dot-coms, are not yet willing
to take any economic risks. As a result, things like venture-capital funds
and initial public offerings - the capital-investment seed corn that funds
the most innovative and risky new enterprises necessary to move the country
to the next level of technology-driven prosperity - aren't being financed.
Nobody, it seems, wants to commit the first new dollar. This is what John
Maynard Keynes meant when he talked about sagging animal spirits in the
1930s.

So where's all the Fed's new cash going? Money-market funds, where savers
get a risk-free, guaranteed return.

Year to date, retail and institutional money funds are rising at an
eye-popping 38% annual rate, or just about $50 billion a month. This is more
than twice last year's pace. Trouble is, this sort of investment is
basically for little old ladies in tennis shoes. It's not the aggressive,
high-tech, entrepreneurial risk taking that will fund the next great idea,
the one that could transform the economy and increase productivity. Until
this moss-covered, risk-averse psychology changes, the Fed can drop interest
rates to zero and dump cash into the economy by the wheelbarrow. But the
economy will not improve.

So how might government policy makers turn this story around? If they
provided new tax-cut incentives for investment, they might just unlock
risk-taking spirits and get the Fed's money working productively in the
economy. The odd part about Bush's tax-cut plan is that the expected flood
of rebates this year is designed to stimulate consumer spending; the
investment incentive-effects from lower tax rates don't kick in for another
4-5 years. But consumer spending isn't the problem. In fact, that's the only
area keeping us out of recession. It's the collapse of business-investment
spending that has been the principal economic illness - especially
technology-related investments which have completely dried up.

Policy makers should be focused on the supply side of the economy, not the
demand side. ""Clever use of further tax cuts - this time to encourage
capital spending - may help prevent those widespread job cuts that would
ultimately guarantee a recession,"" writes Brian Nottage of The Dismal
Scientist. Nottage recommends accelerated depreciation allowances that would
permit a quick write-off for companies investing in new equipment.

This is exactly what former Reagan Treasury advisor Steve Entin supports.
Mr. Entin is backing the High Productivity Investment Act, a bi-partisan
bill crafted by Reps. Phillip English (R., Pa.), and Richard Neal (D.,
Mass.). This measure would let businesses claim the full cost of their
investment in high-tech equipment as a business expense in the year it was
purchased, and would also shorten the time period for all other equipment
purchases. According to Entin, faster write-offs would ""lower the cost of
utilizing equipment and increase capital formation, resulting in higher
labor productivity, real wages, and employment.""

Another tax-cut measure that would surely reawaken investment spirits would
be a reduction in the tax rate on capital gains. ""An increase in the
after-tax return of investing in securities also implies a decrease in the
expected profits investors require from currently hurting companies,"" writes
the dismal scientist, Mr. Nottage.

The self-financing capital-gains tax cut in the mid-1990s provided a booster
rocket to stock markets and economic growth.

Investment tax cuts would encourage savers to take new risks and would put
Fed money creation to real work. Whenever after-tax rewards are sweetened,
more investment is sure to follow. With energy costs coming down, along with
lower inflation and interest rates, the sickly economy will surely mend over
time. But the question is how quickly and at what pace will this economic
mending occur.

A new round of investment tax cuts will give Terminator III Greenspan some
real clout.

1872,"The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London.  Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk 
and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk 
activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new 
assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

1895,"As per our discussion, I have done the following to fix the issues with Questar data:

-  dumped data from 02/04/2001 -> present, for all cycles
-  fixed the transform component to pull the proper column for utilized capacity and also to assign the correct effective date for each value
-  re-transformed and re-loaded ALL cycle 5 data (from the *htm files we have)

Now, in loading the 86 or so days back into the DB, approx. 3603 PRIMARY KEY violations were logged...this means that they are duplicating point data within the same day, same cycle, etc.  If this data could be examined more closely in the reports that are subsequently generated, we can make sure that things are truly copacetic from our side (a ""surface"" scan of the *.htm files shows that they are indeed duplicating points, usually with different names...the utilized capacity associated with these points is the same though, so this doesn't appear to be a big issue, except for the fact that we will continue to have primary key violations being logged).

As always, any questions, just ask.

Thanks,

1898,"Well if you're still there, I hope the studying is going well.  Malo means 
bad.  I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system.  
The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and 
either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.  Neither of us wanted to do it, 
and Ted got stuck with it.  Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 
2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.  Socal can be 
high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most 
expensive gas in the country.  Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.  It's 
not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.  I think I 
might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for 
error because neither of us have done it in a while.  I feel bad.  
Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.  Of 
course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!  

Anwyay, it looks like I'm about done here, so I have one last word for 
you..........................Adios.

Here's the information for the Portland database:

Machine name:  napdx-sql1

password:  fundamentals

The Access database I created is located at:  O:\\fundy_ops\west 
desk\generation database\power_link_database.mdb

The qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using (although it only has 
fields for today and yesterday, and i think i need more).  The tables for the 
query are dbo_LkpOUT_PlantCharacteristics and dbo_LkpOUT_PlantOutage.

In general, I think I need two tables.  One needs to show each plant and the 
other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type (both in the 
Plant table).  I don't really have a query that prepares the data for the 
summary table.  the other two queries in the Access database are a start.  
The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the 
report to look like.  It might be good to group the first table by region and 
then fuel type as well.  When you have a chance to look this stuff over, I'd 
be happy to discuss it further.  Thanks.

1922,"Yesterday afternoon, September 17, the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the 45-day mediation session.  Although not unexpected, but still disappointing, the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs.  This market design proposal encompasses a long, drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like (minimum 12 months) before work begins to develop the new RTO.  The target implementation date of the ISOs is November, 2004, but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is ""subject to extension"" if new design requirements are introduced.  We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures.  A copy of the Judge's report and the Business Plan are attached.

One good aspect of the Judge's report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance.  We too believe this is necessary.  It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities (or the New England ISO) on market design or governance.  We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system, with enhancements where possible.  Others, relying on the ambiguity in FERC's orders, argued that FERC really intended to create a new system, using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs, regardless of time or complication of creating this new market.  We need FERC direction on this, and the Judge makes this clear.

Background

The Judge's primary goal of this 45-day mediation process was simply to establish a ""business plan"" which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created.  Enron, along with many other participants, opposed this approach, arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the Commission.  The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly.  Although the majority of the Judge's report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan, he does discuss two substantive issues:  market design and governance.

Market Design

At the beginning of the mediation, PJM, NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO.  This proposal envisions a time-intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders, with an implementation date in 3-4 years (""Option 1-M""of the Business Plan).  This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs - PJM has its own approach (see below).  The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years (""Option 2-M"" of the Business Plan).   PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 (""Option 3-M"" of the Business Plan).  

We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers, generators, PJM TOs, industrials, and other end use customers (The One RTO Coalition) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJM's system by December 2002, but no later than May, 2003.  Although we (Enron) believe PJM's November 2003 time frame is too conservative, the coalition supports Option 3-M (PJM's approach) since it achieves the Coalition's goals, albeit on a slower timetable.  

As noted above, the Judge endorses Option 1-M, in part because it has a built-in a process for determining ""Best Practices.""  Although PJM also conducted a ""best practices"" analysis, the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJM's determinations of what practices from their ISOs are ""best practices.""  

The Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M (the PJM plan) ""far outstrips"" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support.  However, the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England, even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM.  The Judge states that ""impatience, haste and greed"" should not be permitted to drive the RTO process ""at the expense of sound policy"" and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to ""exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint."" See Report, page 18.

Governance

The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance:  interim governance, final governance, board make-up and stakeholder process.  The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead, he discusses the pros and cons of each option.  Here again, the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commission's preferred governance approach.  The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures.

PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 (and certainly earlier), PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO.  PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs:  5 from PJM, 3 from New York, and 2 from New England.  The Board elects a voting CEO (assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins).  

NY ISO, New England ISO, NY PSC, NY TOs and New England TOs, along with other entities (primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC) all support equal representation on the new Board.  One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO.  The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders.  

We support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system.

Post Mediation

The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge.  

The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants, but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment.  We are working on two sets of comments now, one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition.  We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared.

Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal, we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned (even conservative) approach to reaching that goal.  Therefore, even though the Judge sided with New York, we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal.

Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report.

PJM is reducing the time required to request a change to an existing 
interchange transaction and purchase hourly transmission from 30 to 20 
minutes. 
Changes to interchange transactions will continue to be guaranteed with 30 
minutes notice.

Crazy Caught in California

Peak power prices for Thursday delivery were mostly lower across the West
Wednesday on revised weather forecasts and lower spot gas prices.  On
Tuesday, some forecasts were calling for Arctic air to descend upon northern
areas of the WSCC in the coming days, but on Wednesday most forecasts were
toting less severe warnings.  ""A day ago they were saying we would get hit
by a blast of Arctic air, and now they are saying we will get some cooler
air, but not of the Arctic variety,"" said one Northwest utility trader.  The
revised forecasts also helped to lower balance-of-the-month contract costs
at all of the major Western hubs.  ""I was shocked that the dailies and the
balance traded lower today, we were expecting at least a little upside after
yesterday's session,"" said one surprised marketer.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas
contracts settled lower Wednesday despite a supportive AGA inventory report,
largely due to concerns surrounding high storage levels.  February and March
Hub gas contracts fell 5.3 cents each to settle at 2.228 and 2.232$/mmBtu,
respectively.  Wednesday's AGA report indicated that 190 bcf were pulled out
of storage last week, well above industry estimates calling for a 175-bcf
draw.  Total U.S. inventories stand at 2.666 tcf, 1.014 tcf, or 71 percent
of full.  Of the 190-bcf drawn last week only seven were taken from the
Western Consuming Region.  Total Western stocks stand at 407 bcf, or 81
percent of full.  Western stocks were at 277 bcf on the same week last year,
and have averaged 313 bcf over the past five years.  In news of the weird, a
recently fired employee of California nuclear power plant San Onofre (2,150
MW total) was arrested on Wednesday for making death threats against his
former boss and coworkers.  Law enforcement investigators found over 200
guns, rifles, and munitions in his home and more when they searched a nearby
storage locker.  Two officers were briefly hospitalized after inhaling an
unknown yellow gas released from a canister in the storage locker.
Officials said the arrest was not terrorist-related, and with the suspect in
custody no further threat was posed to the power plant.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were steady to slightly higher on
Wednesday, to the surprise of many.  On Tuesday, regional forecasts were
revised to reflect the anticipated arrival of Arctic air, which pushed the
dailies higher.  Wednesday brought about another forecast revision, this
time in the opposite direction.  While longer-term forecasts continued to
call for below-normal temperatures for much of the region, the extent of the
cooling was not expected to be as severe as previously anticipated.  Flow
forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised slightly lower on Wednesday, coming
in at 75 kcfs through Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 90 kcfs
Monday, and 85 kcfs next Tuesday and Wednesday.  The lower flows partly
reflected the return of cooler temperatures, which have curtailed recent
snowmelt, reducing side flows in turn.  On the topic of water, the Northwest
River Forecast Center slightly lowered its runoff forecast for this year at
some of the region's large Columbia River Dams.  Nonetheless, it appeared
likely that the Northwest would still have much healthier water levels in
2002 compared to last year's ""drought-like"" conditions.  April through
September supplies at Grand Coulee were forecast to be 94 percent of normal,
while The Dalles was expected to be about 93 percent of normal for the same
period.  In unit news, Colstrip #4 (700 MW) tripped late Tuesday or early
Wednesday due to a suspected tube leak, and was reportedly given a 48-hour
turnaround time.

Day-ahead electricity prices were mostly lower in California on Wednesday
amid warmer weather for much of the state.  NP15 and SP15 traded almost flat
to each other, while COB traded about two dollars lower.  Balance of January
at NP15 slipped with the rest of the West on Wednesday, trading between 20.5
and 22.5$/MWh and losing its premium over the day-ahead prices.  In
political news, the CPUC said they wanted more input in the PG&E
reorganization proposal.  Specifically, the commission thinks parent PG&E
Corp. should be required to invest a more substantial stake in the repayment
process.  The FERC judge who originally ruled in favor of El Paso Corp.
officially reopened the anti-competitive case against the energy firm,
saying new evidence could make him change his recommendation.  The company
was accused of withholding transmission on its natural gas pipelines into
California during last year's energy crisis.  In unit news, Moss Landing #6
(739 MW) was operating at 300 MW on Wednesday for planned reasons.  There
was talk that one of the two Intermountain units (820 each) was coming off
this weekend for annual maintenance, while other sources said it wasn't
exiting the grid until early February, but no official word was available as
of this writing.  Above-normal temperatures were expected to continue on
Thursday, with forecasts calling for highs in the mid-50s to mid-60s at
mid-state load centers, and in the low-70s in the south.  Highs in the Bay
area were expected to drop about ten degrees on Friday, but otherwise little
change was expected in the Golden State through Sunday.  The most current
six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from January 15 to 19.

It was a buyers market in the Southwest on Wednesday, with several players
reporting that sellers were coming out of the woodwork.  ""We tried to sell
early, but everyone told us to call back if we needed any power.  Later on
we did call some people back because prices fell below the marginal costs of
some of our less-efficient units,"" said one Arizona-based trader.  Daytime
highs in Phoenix hit 81 degrees on Tuesday, while overnight lows were
hovering mainly in the 50s.  Utilities were still seeing loads pick up in
the late evening and early morning hours, but the patterns were said to be
more reminiscent of spring than winter.  In unit news, Four Corners #5 (750
MW) was still operating at 550 MW on Wednesday due to an air preheater
problem.  The New-Mexico based unit was scheduled to come down for annual
maintenance on January 15, and not return until March 14.  Weather forecasts
called for above-normal temperatures though the week in the region's major
load centers, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was prediction normal
temperatures from January 15 through 19.

said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact

Not to back-pass the issue, I think this is generally a Legal question.  From 
the Credit perspective, our concern is Enron's ability to:
- Call for collateral
- Receive it and hold it
- Have title to it/perfect it in case of default
- Retain it in the case of bankruptcy to offset exposures

If we agree to accept it in yen or dollars, in Japan or the U.S., from my 
perspective, it is important that we simply identify the necessary legal, tax 
and operational procedures, then implement the processes that allow Enron to 
accomplish the above criteria.

If I need to address these issues in greater detail, or if you need anything 
further, please let me know.

comments.  I see no problems except:

1.  The document is expressed to be governed by the law of the""United
Kingdom.""   I have never seen this formulation and think it should say
""England,"" as I believe there are in fact multiple legal systems (e.g.,
Scottish) within the U.K.

2.  I am not sure why all collateral except LCs was deleted.  Was this
agreed by EFR?  If so, OK.  If not, could the CSA provide for other
collateral as Gordon requested.  It is unusual for SR entities to use LCs
in non-reinsurance situations and would probably cost them less to post
Treasuries.  Here it is of course unlikely that EFR will have to post
anything, since EFR will always be in the money to some extent.

3. Did you switch to the English law form of CSA?

2007,"Patti/Janie:

To recap the billing issue between EPMI and ENA with respect to the Harbor 
deal, as indicated on the attached spreadsheet, I believe EPMI ordered 
292,500 MMBtu at an average price of $4.65/MMBtu for a total of $1,360,125.   
Harbor Cogen used 288,574 MMBtu (this usage will be in the ENA SoCalGas 
imbalance statement).  ENA delivered 297,348 MMBtu in a pattern that resulted 
in a price above $4.65/MMBtu.  In the system right now, ENA is trying to bill 
EPMI 297,348 MMBtu at this higher price.  

So, there are two issues.  First, does Janie agree with my statement as to 
what EPMI bought, given that the Gas Daily arithmetic seems to be indicating 
a higher weighted average price than $4.65.   If not, let's get that on the 
table.  Janie could you let me know on that?  Secondly, how can we deal with 
this volume issue?  ENA can bill based on deliveries as this is how gas is 
typically sold.  ENA can bill based on usage as we do with accounts such as 
Jefferson Smurfit and Filtrol.  The concept of billing based on ordered is 
troublesome as if ENA were to try to bill on what EPMI ordered, this would 
make the imbalance calculation that Sherry A. does out of wack.    

So, to keep this simple, to address this volume issue on a go forward basis, 
an approach that might work is that ENA would bill EPMI on usage at the
