morning to go to Vail.  Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point on 
v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily trade on 
value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between 
hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k cash will average 3 
cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet that's what it is 
worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get there k/m=3.  The 
same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will be exceptionally 
strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last year.  But cal 2 will 
lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are selling right now because 
every equity analyst and even Pira are telling their customers that cal 2 
will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j 
blow out.  After this winter, who in there right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h 
again.  my thought is that the primary juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will 
be under some pressure.  i'm a seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.  Not much in it

25,"Mr. Shankman:

In preparation for the meeting on December 12th with Larry Kellner, CFO, 
Continental Airlines, I have noted below some background on the 
Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  Mr. 
Shankman, please advise if you would like me to distribute this to the 
attendees.    

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

Over the past several years Enron has been hedging Continental's crude oil.  
The relationship has been beneficial to both sides.  As a result, since 1999 
Enron has made over $9 million and Continental has saved over $45 million.  

The purpose for the December 12th meeting is to address three initiatives in 
order of economic value:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and 
(3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.   Several new initiatives being 
proposed to Continental include the following:   

exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets (Craig Breslau, 
Originator)  
transacting financial swaps on line (Larry Gagliardi, Originator)  
creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry (Mark Tawney 
and Gary Taylor, Originators)
outsourcing Continental's antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these 
products with Enron (Alan Engberg, Originator)

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)

Meeting Attendees from Enron:
Jeff Shankman, President and COO, Enron Global Markets
John Nowlan, Vice President, Enron Global Markets
Craig Breslau, Vice President, Enron North America
Mark Tawney, Director, Enron Global Markets (tentative) 

DISCUSSION: 
(Developed through conversations with Alan Engberg, Larry Gagliardi, Gary 
Taylor, Craig Breslau, Tracy Ramsey and Lucy Ortiz.)

Enron Buy Side with Continental:

Current Enron verifiable spend on Continental airline tickets was 
approximately $40 million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six 
months of 2000.  

Enron Sell Side with Continental:

(1) FUEL MANAGEMENT: 

Current Business:  Over the past 2 years, Craig Breslau and others have been 
managing a strong relationship with Greg Hartford, VP, Continental Fuel 
Management, hedging Continental's crude oil.  The first transaction was on 
January 14, 1998 -- a one month Forward on Kero.  Since then, Enron has 
completed 29 transactions with two commodities:  KERO and Crude.  Current 
business consists of three crude call options, settling in December 2000 
($31.00) and January, 2001 ($34.00 and $35.00)

Value to Enron: Enron has earned $9,682,084 (1999-October 6, 2000)

Value to Continental:  Continental has saved $45,001,744 (1999-October 6, 
2000)

Possible next steps:    (a) A transaction where Enron exchanges call options 
on crude oil for airline tickets.

(b) Financial jet swaps on line:  Larry Gagliardi has already spoken with 
Rick Pressly, Director, Continental Fuel Management, regarding financial jet 
swaps on line.   At the time, Pressly was not interested in pursuing this 
product offering.  

Value to Continental for (b):  a more perfect hedge as opposed to hedging 
with crude oil since hedging jet fuel with jet is a more perfect hedge.  
Enron could offer services for the whole year and explore multi-year options 
as well both with financial and physical jet fuel.

Possible next steps:  Would Larry Kellner be interested in (a) or (b)?  Enron 
could also supply Continental with jet fuel physical in the following 
locations such as the US Gulf Coast, New York harbor, the US West Coast, and 
Europe.  (Enron is doing this now with Delta airlines in New York harbor).  
If so, Gagliardi could provide a guest password and Enron Online 
identification number if Kellner's office wanted to review the product.

(2) WEATHER DERIVATIVE  PRODUCT:

Business proposition:  Create a basket of weather related risks - such that 
aggregate bad weather above a tolerable level would result in payment from 
Enron to Continental.

Continental Airlines clearly has exposure to weather as indicated in their 
annual reports and periodic press releases - particularly those discussing 
earnings.  It is extremely difficult to envision the perfect weather hedge 
for all of Continental's weather related exposure.  However, it is not 
difficult to envision simple ways to reduce a large portion of it.  
Continental has hubs in Houston, Newark, and Cleveland.  The weather 
conditions that create delays and increased costs in these areas include - 
rainfall above certain amounts, snowfall above certain amounts, temperatures 
below freezing (de-icing costs), winds above a certain speed, etc.  

Value to us:  Create value by designing a basket of these risks.  

Value to them:  Creation of a weather hedge to protect Continental's exposure.

Possible next steps:   Upper management would need to issue a directive to 
various groups within Continental to describe what weather conditions affect 
the bottom line, how much they affect the bottom line, and then ask each 
group to attach a ""confidence level"" to each of their estimates - Continental 
could start a weather risk management program by only hedging a weighted 
average of their exposure x their confidence level - or some portion thereof.

Exposure areas would be categorized according to the following:

Clear exposure.  Quantifiable.
Clear exposure.  Difficult to quantify
Potential exposure.  Quantifiable
Potential exposure.  Difficult to quantify

For each of the above categories, Enron would also need an indication of 
whether Continental has historical cost data against which we can regress 
historical weather data.

Enron's weather derivatives team could then sit down with Kirk Rummel, 
Director and Airport Services Division Controller, and some of his team (or 
others designated by Kellner) and brainstorm about different types of weather 
that cause increased cost to Continental.  (Gary Taylor made a brief 
presentation to Rummel on November 6th; no follow up action with Enron has 
taken place to date)  

(3)  PLASTICS:

Business proposition:    Alan Engberg proposed that Continental outsource 
their antifreeze risk (ethylene glycol / propylene glycol) and plastics (high 
impact polystyrene, polyethylene) by hedging those products with Enron.

Value to Continental: Cost/Budget certainty (assuming a perfect hedge whereby 
their purchase contracts are linked to the index used for hedging) and 
associated reduction in volatility of cash flows

Value to Enron:  The value is approximately $2 million notional value if they 
hedged 100% of their 4 million pound polystyrene exposure.  Since Continental 
has not yet shared the size of their antifreeze buy, Engberg cannot comment 
on the potential value to Enron though he is fairly certain it would be much 
larger than $2 million.

Possible next steps
This proposition is being considered by Ron Howard's team at Continental.  
Continental needs to share their antifreeze spend with Enron.  Enron could 
then develop a proposal to Continental that includes perceived benefits of 
outsourcing their commodity risk to Enron.  Could a follow-up meeting with 
Ron Howard's team and Larry Kellner's designated contact be arranged to 
facilitate this process?

Alan Engberg also recommends working with Continental on a strategic approach 
to modelling their overall exposures using VaR may prove extremely powerful 
and rewarding to both companies.  David Port is already (x-39823)  looking at 
ways to outsource Enron's expertise in this area.  Continental could be a 
pioneer in the effort.  Factors to model would
include jet fuel, natural gas, electricity, currency, interest rates, 
plastics, antifreeze, paper, and, metal.","Shankman Larry Kellner Craig Breslau Larry Gagliardi Mark Tawney

Assistants: Please be ready to submit a churn on this Friday 10/5/01 for your individual groups (I will let you know if this changes and once I am certain of the seat numbers for your groups, I will give them to you). I will also need to give you your mail stop locations at the new building, which I am working on now with the mailroom.  In the meantime, from now till we move, please start cleaning up your areas and your groups areas and discarding anything that isn't needed.  It has been requested that only 6 boxes per person be moved because space is limited.  So we need to decide what can be sent to archives.  I will send you some forms for this. Please come to me with any questions.

Deskheads:  Unless, there is any changes from the office of the chair, I will set up a meeting with each one of you on Thursday to make sure you have no changes to your seating.  Once the churn is submitted there can not be any changes other than new additions to the group or deletions from the group.  This is to prevent there being any mixups when installing equipment at the new building.

Rob is continuing his career with Fidelity, though in a much more convenient

every day!

We would love to see everybody before we leave, though it may not be
possible with the holidays.  I'll be back in Dallas once a week in January
and February, so we could plan to get together during one of those trips.
But before that time, Rob and I will be with a group of friends from HBK at
Martini Ranch on Thursday, December 14th right after work.  I'm sure we'll
be there late, given my love of martinis, so please stop by if you can.

Regardless, I really want to stay in touch with my Texas friends, so make
sure and send me your updated contact information if anything has changed in
the last year.  Please pass this on to people who I may have inadvertently
missed or I did not have their current email address.

55,"The attached report contains an analysis of fuel switching capability. It 
also details one  of the current problems with EIA data. The EIA data  
contains FERC form I data. Once generation is sold its fuel consumption is no 
longer reported to the DOE. Hence an analysis of the DOE cost  and quality of 
generation fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data. WEFA gets 
around this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data. After 1998, there were 
significant sales of generation due to the ongoing legislation and

After the Universal-Enron conference call with Elyse Kalmans and Misha

The majority of the JPI is for-profit and therefore Community Relations 
cannot be a sponsoring party.
Elyse recommended I contact Mark Palmer to discuss the sponsorship and the 
value tied to EMS, Weather, Plastics & Credit.
Universal was hesitant to comment on dollar amounts for the sponsorship but 
noted $250K would be the lowest amount for the JPI Virtual Institute. 

I wanted to consult your advice as to what tactics would be best at this

I am excited that you will get back to work now.  I know you don't like being bored.
 
Sorry about Tahoe.  Las Vegas sounds interesting.  I'll talk to Dad.  I talked with Vivian this morning and we are planning on a golf trip maybe to Mexico.  I don't know when we will be going.  Las Vegas is not my first choice for a vacation after such a long time without one.  However, I welcome any opportunity to spend time with our son.  I'll talk with him tonight and let you know.
 
Have a great weekend.  Hi to Shanna.
 
Love you, Mom

86,"Eric,

Good to hear from you.  Hope you had a good Christmas and New Year's vacation.  I just got back to Boston last night.  I was in KY until the 30th then went skiing in Colorado (Copper and Winter Park) with some friends from here.  The snow wasn't great at Copper, but Winter Park was great and snowed the entire time we were there.  It's nice to be back at school, but I'm not looking forward to studying again.  Crossword puzzles and mutual fund research sound glorious right now.  Finals weren't too bad at all.  Normal classes are pretty intense, so there isn't much you can do in the way of preparation except relax and get plenty of sleep.  

Glad to hear that you still have a job.  I've been keeping up with Enron in the papers.  What's the latest on the trading division sale?  I knew that Citigroup had made a bid, but is anyone else expected to come in?  Summer internship interviews are coming up, so I'm sure I'll have plenty to talk about with Enron on my resume.  How are all of our friends making out?  I got an email from Plauche that he had been laid off.  What about Lenhart, Boucher, Chad, and everyone else?  

My dentist is Brian Kilgore, whom I liked very much.  He's out on I-10 and the Beltway.  He referred me to Thomas Weiler for the wisdom teeth surgery.  I think he's covered under the Enron dental plan, too.  

Enjoy the downtime while you have it.  Say hello to your family for me.

124,"I received a call from Bill Olson (NMOCD) this morning regarding remediation 
activities at the Roswell Station. Bill said that Dave Cobrain with the NMED 
HRMB made a visit to the OCD's office yesterday to get an update on 
activities at the site. Bill said that he provided Mr. Cobrain with copies of 
assessment reports for the site. The last report submitted to the OCD was the 
""Phase IV Assessment Report, Ground Water Monitoring Report, & Phase V Ground 
Water Assessment Work Plan"" dated June 30, 1999. The Phase V work plan was 
subsequently approved by the OCD in a letter dated August 19, 1999. The 
assessment activities had been on hold pending a resolution of off-site 
access issues. More recently, we obtained an amendment to the existing water 
development easement so that we could complete the Phase V assessment 
activities. This work is scheduled to be complete within the next 4-6 weeks. 
In a letter to the OCD dated August 29, 2000, we indicated that a report of 
ongoing groundwater monitoring activities and a Phase V assessment report 
would be submitted to the OCD office by December 31, 2000. This was the last 
written correspondence between the OCD and TW.

Bill also indicated that he has worked with Dave Cobrain before. Bill had 
several positive and encouraging comments about Dave and about his discussion 
with Dave, including comments from Dave to the effect that media should not 
be assumed to contain listed wastes and that TW should proceed with 
remediation with oversight by the OCD. Bill said that he informed Dave of 
certain outstanding issues that have impeded progress with remediation at 
this site. Bill also indicated to me that he was encouraged by Dave's 
involvement and with other individuals now on staff at the NMED HRMB.",Bill Olson NMOCD Bill Dave Cobrain Cobrain Dave,,NMED HRMB OCD Ground Water Monitoring Report TW

127,"I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.",Transwestern Butch Russell Rick Smith Laguna George Robinson POEP Transwstern Lagunas Syed Risvi John,,"PCB TW PEOP UST ETS Laguna

128,"Mike - I'd suggest we move on any decon work for our facilities at the same 
time.....

The find of PCBs in the compressors will undoubtedly be the subject of next 
week's meeting.  The presence of PCBs does not limit their use at that 
station.  PG&E would be reluctant to move the engines around on the system.  
Depending upon the concentrations at the time, they may be restricted in 
their ability to sell or reuse the compressors.  I'm not aware of any true 
decon process for such equipment.  Vector may be able to propose a piecemeal 
decon project but it would likely be expensive and involve the outage of the 
equipment for a significant period of time.   We might want to gather a group 
of folks and go over the agenda and our pososible response to a request by 
PG&E to take down thier compression.

132,"First Aid Tips
In a medical emergency, knowing what to do can make all the difference.
Here are some tips to help you handle an unexpected injury or illness:
* In the event of decapitation, sit the victim's body in a chair
as best you can, balance the head on top of the shoulders, and walk away
whistling nonchalantly.
* Always keep plenty of gauze around the house in case you invent
an invisibility potion.
* If you did all you could and the victim still dies, pat him or
her down for a Snickers bar. It's not like you don't deserve one.
* Nothing revives a stroke victim like an eye-popping orgasm.
* If someone you know is seriously injured, cradle his or her head
in your lap and scream, ""Why?""
* Administering CPR is easy. Just do it like you saw them do on TV
that one time.
* In the event of accidental drug overdose, call Lou Reed
immediately.
* To stop a nosebleed, apply pressure. To start a nosebleed, apply
even greater pressure in short, repeated bursts.
* If a person requires artificial respiration, and you are of the
same sex as the person, and no one of the opposite sex is around to
perform the procedure, you are gay.
* If the Heimlich maneuver is ineffective on a choking victim,
grab his or her neck and squeeze downward to force the food into the
stomach. If this fails, grab the victim's ankles and swing him or her
around in a circle to force the food up.
* Make sure your first-aid kid contains a large, frilly Victorian
fan to revive fainting victims.
* If you are a hideous, disfigured hunchback and you see someone
who is injured and unconscious, treat the person. Then, as the person
begins to wake up, retreat into hiding. The person will always wonder
who saved him or her, and the experience will be poignant in a
bittersweet way.
* As a rule of thumb, always ask yourself this question: What
would Randolph Mantooth do?
* If possible, try to be the guy who tells the victim,
""Everything's going to be all right,"" while others do the actual work.

TOPAZ: NOVEMBER'S BIRTHSTONE
=============================
True topaz, symbol of love an affection, aid to sweetness of
disposition, and birthstone of November, is one of nature's
most wonderful and least-known gemstone families.  The true
topaz is rarely seen in jewelry stores.  Unfortunately, most
people know only the quartz (citrine) topaz.  In the past,
almost any yellow stone was called topaz.

Topaz occurs not only in the transparent yellow, yellow brown,
orangy brown, and pinky brown colors most popularly associated
with it, but also in light to medium red, light to medium
blue, very light green, violet and colorless.

Blue topaz has become very popular in recent years, although
most of it is treated and there is no way to determine which
is treated and which is natural.  Some of the deeper blue
treated topazes have been found to be radioactive and possibly
a health hazard.  In the United States, all blue topaz must be
tested for radiation levels.  However, be very careful when
buying blue topaz outside the United States, since it probably
has not been tested.


GIRDLE
===============
The girdle is the diamond's setting edge.  It needs to be just
thick enough to let the stone be set securely.  If it is too
thin, it is vulnerable to chipping;  too thick, and it can be
unattractive and difficult to set.  A thick girdle often creates
large, fuzzy gray reflections in the stone, especially if, as is
often the case, it accumulates dirt and grime.

On a step cut like an emerald, the girdle should be uniform in
thickness around the stone.  On a round, oval or cushion-shape
brilliant, it should undulate slightly between pairs of mains
and girdle facets and be thicker between the points of opposing
mains.  The girdle of a marquise, pear or heart is often slightly
thicker at the points to reduce the possibility of chipping.
Hearts have thicker girdles in their clefts.  Although slight
variations in girdle thickness are usually disregarded, sizable
variations can pose setting problems.

DIAMONDS AND GREASE
===================
If you wear a diamond, you probably have been surprised how
quickly a dirty film collects on the surface.  This is due
in large part to the fact that diamonds adhere to grease.  Put
your hands in dishwater and the grease quickly coats your
diamond.  The same thing happens with hand cream, body oils
and any other form of grease.

The fact that diamonds adhere to grease led to the invention of
the grease table in the late 1800s to separate diamonds for the
ore they are mined in.  The concentrate recovered from the
washing pans, pulsators, or heavy media separators is washed
over tables coated with thick grease.  The diamonds will adhere
to the table and then the resulting mixture is periodically
scraped off and melted down to remove the diamonds.

Today, the grease belt is more common.  Grease is automatically
applied at one end of a conveyor belt, the concentrates are
washed across it, and the resulting diamond-studded grease is
scraped off at the other end.

The amount of blueground (diamond ore)which has to be processed
is enormous.  Although figures differ for each mine, it takes
about 250 tons of blueground to produce a single one-carat
polished stone.


NATURAL
===========
A natural may not be a fault.  It's actually a piece of the
natural surface of the diamond crystal.  In cutting, a cutter
may decide to leave part of the ""natural"" rough surface in
order to get as large a diamond as possible from the rough
stone.  If this natural is no thicker than the thickness of the
girdle and does not distort the circumference of the stone,
most dealers consider it a minor defect at worst; if it extends
into the crown or pavilion of the stone, it is a serious fault.

Sometimes, if the natural is somewhat large but slightly below
the girdle, it will be polished off.  This produces an extra
facet.


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
===============
Name:  The Lesotho
Weight: 601.25 carats (rough)
Color: Brown

Lesotho is an isolated, landlocked mountain kingdom, poor
in natural resources and entirely surrounded by South
Africa. Lesotho was considered too remote to allow
profitable diamond mining.  In 1960, when the government
opened 30-square-foot claims, there was no shortage of
local prospectors seeking a big strike.  On May 26, 1967
Ernestine Ramaboa, working the claim she shared with her
husband Petrus, discovered a brown diamond of extraordinary
size.  The diamond, weighing 601.25 carats, caused a
sensation.  Eventually sold to Harry Winston who had the
diamond flown to New York and invited the Ramaboas as
his guests.

On March 5, 1968, on live TV, the stone was cleaved at
the precise point where nature left a crack in the
surface.  It was eventually cut into 18 polished stones
totaling 242.50 carats, the largest a 71.73 carat
emerald cut.

THE GREAT DIAMOND HUNT
=========================
Diamonds have been found in India for at least 3000 years.
For centuries, in fact, India was the world's only major
source, although there is no record of systematic mining
before about 1000 AD.  The Indian mines are no longer
significant producers.  Through the ages, however, new
sources are constantly discovered as older ones are depleted.

In the 1970s, gold miners in Brazil began finding shiny
pebbles which they tended to keep because they were beautiful.
Most had no idea of what they were worth, and better-informed
prospectors bought them for pocket change.

Over a hundred years later, diamonds were discovered in South
Africa, where the first alluvial (water carried)finds let
prospectors to the kimberlite pipes which had originally
brought these treasures to the surface.  This in tern led to
greater understanding of the geology of diamonds, and
transformed prospecting from a haphazard venture into a
scientific enterprise.

Today, diamonds have been found on every continent, although
not everywhere in commercially viable quantities and
qualities.  It is becoming clear that diamonds are much more
widely distributed over the entire globe than people once
thought.  Prospecting technology is also increasingly
sophisticated-the independent prospector with his shovel and
pan is being replaced by electromagnetic mapping techniques
and helicopter-mounted infrared cameras.

As a result, three out of five of today's major sources have
been discovered in the last quarter-century.  There is no
likelihood of running out of gem quality diamonds in the
foreseeable future.


ROUNDNESS
=============
A round diamond is not perfectly round and its roundness will
affect value.  The measurements of a round diamond include the
highest diameter, the lowest diameter and the depth.
Recognizing the rarity of truly round diamonds, some deviation
is permitted, and the stone will not be considered ""out-of-
round"" unless it deviates by more than the established norm-
approximately 0.10 millimeter (one-tenth of a millimeter) in
a one-carat stone.  In other words, the difference between the
two diameters should be less than 0.10 millimeters for a one
carat diamond, 0.12 millimeters for a two carat and 0.14
millimeters for a three carat.


AGS INTRODUCES LASER INSCRIPTIONS
=================================
The American Gem Society lab is now offering a laser
inscription service-similar to that offered by many of its
competitors-that ""writes"" on a stone's girdle.  The new
system an inscribe any type of gemstone, including colored
gemstones and can be used to inscribe words and/or logos,
and is experimenting with bar codes.

The AGS has become the premier grading laboratory for round
exceptionally well-cut diamonds.  When wholesalers buy stones
that have great cut they send them to the AGS for grading
even if they have been previously graded at another lab.  The
wholesalers hope to attain the AGS Ideal cut grade which means
the diamonds has Ideal polish, Ideal symmetry and Ideal
proportions.  These AGS Ideal cut diamonds are priced at a
premium but are in high demand by customers who want the best
of the best.

As if the Denver RB situation wasn't already goofy enough with Terrell Davis
getting close to being ready, ESPN's John Clayton is now reporting that
Olandis Gary could get the start this week in an effort to shake the offense
up.

Anderson did have a fumble Sunday which drew the ire of Shanahan.

It might be worth making a move for Gary in your league if you can grab him
cheaply.   But I'm not excited yet.   More likely, you can use this info to
taunt the Gary / Davis / Anderson owners in your league...

prices are driving up consumer bills and state regulators look at options for 
unbundling Southern California Gas Co.'s transmission and storage system. 
According to other state energy officials he talks with, Richard Bilas, 
commissioner at the California Public Utilities Commission, said, ""We could 
have some real problems."" Bilas, the former energy commissioner and 
immediate-past president of the CPUC, has proposed a modest unbundling of 
SoCalGas' system, given the current energy price volatility, in a proposed 
settlement decision now being reviewed. Action on the proposed decision could 
come Dec. 21, but observers predict alternate orders will be offered by some 
of Bilas's colleagues on the five-member CPUC, and that could push into next 
year final action. 
If gas prices continue at their precedent-setting levels, California likely 
will be intervening at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as it already 
has been doing regarding last summer's electricity price spikes, Bilas said. 
""There are a lot of things the state can do, but whether they are done is a 
matter of philosophical and political judgment,"" he said. ""If gas prices get 
totally out whack in the view of a number of state decision-makers, there is 
likely to be intervention on behalf of the state into gas pricing. And I 
don't know if any of that serves the public well in the long run, but this is 
a short-run political problem."" 
As for his proposed decision on settlement for the unbundling of the 
SoCalGas's system, Bilas is unsure at this point if it will stimulate a more 
robust core aggregation market ",Bilas Mike Day Richard Bilas,,"the Comprehensive

? Undercollet Remains Sticking Point for Utility Creditors (especially QFs), 
involuntary bankruptcy likely if issue is not addressed in today's CAPUC 
hearings
? CAPUC Rate Increase Set at 40%, Pending DWR Power Purchase Details
? Davis Defends No Rate Increase Position, Distances Himself from CAPUC

QF/Generator undercollect may be an invitation to involuntary bankruptcy
As reported last week, QF has sitting and waiting to hear what the CAPUC has 
to say, unfortunately it may not be what the QFs want to hear.  The 
utilities' undercollect, which will not be addressed in today's CAPUC 
hearings, could very well provide an invitation for QFs and generators to 
file involuntary bankruptcy against SoCal and PG&E.  Recent rate hikes 
proposed by the CAPUC specifically dictate that any revenue generated from 
rate increases cannot be used to pay off utility past debt, leaving the QF 
with little hope of recovery.  QFs were obviously dismayed by the CAPUC's 
draft order and if the decision is passed as it currently reads, an 
involuntary bankruptcy filing is still likely.

CAPUC holds rate increase hearings today
As reported yesterday, Loretta Lynch released the details of the CAPUC's 
draft rate increase order last night.  There is expected to be a 3 cent/kwh 
surcharge on power bills or roughly a 40% rate increase.  A portion of this 
""surcharge"" will be given to the DWR to cover its costs and the order 
concludes that utilities need revenues on a going-forward basis.  Therefore, 
utilities can only use the revenues for power purchases going forward and are 
expressly forbidden from using this cash to pay down past debt (ex. QFs).  
However, the utilities are ordered to resume payments to the QFs on a 
going-forward basis.  The net effect of the order is to allow the utilities 
to operate in case of bankruptcy.

One interesting point in the draft is its decision which calls on the 
utilities to join  with the state in pursuing a refund on the amount 
overcharged for power by the generators.  The suggestion is that the 
utilities take legal action against the generators to recoup funds.  Only the 
funds recovered from generators can be used to pay down the utilities' past 
debt.  If the utilities choose this course of action, it would be a very 
lengthy process.
  
Davis contends with Lynch on CAPUC rate increases.
Davis has thus far refused to support CAPUC's proposed rate increase stating 
the CAPUC decision making board is an independent body and that he continues 
to believe that a resolution can be found within the current rate structure.  
Sources indicate that he is likely to ask for Lynch's letter of resignation, 
however, there is no indication she will comply.  Senator Burton, who 
supports the CAPUC's plan, reportedly will protect Lynch by not allowing her 
to be impeached (which is the only other way she could be removed by the 
governor).",Loretta Lynch QFs Davis Lynch Burton,3 cent,Undercollet CAPUC QF SoCal DWR utilities Lynch

2/28/1 18:56 (New York)

Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2)

     (Adds names of California generators in fifth paragraph, and
Reliant comment in sixth.)

     New York, Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray
Davis said he intends to ask power generators to accept partial
payment for power sold to the state's cash-strapped utilities this
summer and winter, Wall Street analysts who attended a closed-door
meeting with the governor said.
     ``It looks like the people he wants sharing the pain are the
companies generating power sold to utilities,'' said Kevin Boone,
a bond analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. who attended the meeting
in New York. ``He wants to force them to take cents on the dollar.
That seems to be what his initial proposal will be.''
      PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, and Edison
International's Southern California Edison, the state's largest
utilities, are near bankruptcy after accumulating more than $12
billion in debt buying power from generators at soaring prices.
Regulators have not let the utilities pass on most of their power-
buying debt to consumers.
     Davis said some generators have approached him with offers to
accept less than full payment, said Michael Worms, a utility
analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. Davis spoke to about 35
analysts from Wall Street and energy-research firms in New York in
a meeting that was criticized by investors and analysts who were
not allowed to attend.

                        No Names Mentioned

    Davis didn't specify which companies came to him with partial-
payment proposals, analysts said. Duke Energy Corp., Calpine
Corp., Willams Cos., Dynegy Inc. and Reliant Energy Inc. are among
the biggest suppliers of electricity to California utilities.
    ``I'm not aware of him talking to anyone at Duke about
forgiveness,'' Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said.
      Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said Davis's proposal
``doesn't really come as a surprise'' because politicians in
Sacramento, the capital of California, have been discussing the
idea for weeks. Reliant has opposed anything other than full
payment of its debts.
    ``Williams fully expects to be paid the money that is owed
us,'' spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins said. ``We have worked in
very good faith with the state, selling voluntarily into the
market, negotiating with them for long-term contracts and working
with them to solve the problem.''
      Enron Corp., an energy trader that has set aside unspecified
reserve for possible losses in California, has not been approached
about debt forgiveness, said Karen Denne, a company spokeswoman.
      ``This proposal. . . is news to us,'' and does not address
the immediate problem of electricity shortages in California this
summer, Denne said. Industry analysts say California, which has
already had scattered blackouts this winter, will face more this
summer when power demand surges.

                     Buying the Grid

     Davis said at the meeting that negotiations to buy PG&E
Corp.'s power transmission system may take another 30 days, though
he was optimistic an agreement could be reached within two weeks,
analysts said. He offered few other specifics on the PG&E talks,
said Steve Fetter, group managing director of global power for
Fitch Inc.
     State officials are trying to reach agreement with PG&E and
Edison, as well as with Sempra Energy, to buy their transmission
lines as part of a plan to help them pay debt and borrow money at
low interest rates to avoid bankruptcy. A tentative agreement to
buy Edison's lines for $2.76 billion was reached last week. Talks
with Sempra are continuing.
     The governor said he was optimistic an agreement with PG&E
could be reached in two weeks, but negotiations could drag on
longer, Fetter said.
       ``We are making progress,'' Davis said at a news conference
after the analysts meeting at the Cornell Club on the east side of
Manhattan. ``We are close to a final agreement with (Edison) and
relatively close with Sempra.''
      The governor told analysts he's confident he can get a
utility rescue plan that doesn't require an immediate rate
increase, but Davis did say that rate increases are going to be
needed at some unspecified time in the future, Fetter said.
    Davis said he wasn't sure if he resolved all of analysts'
doubts about California's plans to save its utilities from
bankruptcy.
    ``He's in a hole and he's got a long way to go to get out of
it,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Credit Suisse First
Boston who attended the meeting. ``We still don't have a final
solution in sight.''
     Shares of San Francisco-based PG&E fell 9 cents to $13.96.
Rosemead, California-based Edison shares fell 4 cents to $14.90.
San Diego-based Sempra fell 16 cents to $22.15.

Moore was placed on injured reserve by the Arizona Cardinals this weekend, effectively ending his season. Moore, who hasn't played a game this year due to a hamstring injury, could be coming to the end of his career.

Rookie Anthony Thomas is listed as a gametime decision due to a hamstring injury, but you'd have to bel! ie! ve that coach Dick Jauron wants to get him has healthy as possible for the team's upcoming playoff run.

Thomas (hamstring) missed practice on Friday and is listed as a gametime decision against Detroit. Considering that Chicago is in the playoff hunt and is playing a team that's 0-10, don't be surprised if coach Dick Jauron gives Thomas another week off in order to get healthy.

Thomas missed Friday's practice due to a strained hamstring, and remains a gametime decision. James Allen would get the start in his place, and we recommend you wait until a final decision is reached before you opt to use either back this week.

Tai Streets <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=133425&>, WR SF - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Stree! ts! was added to the injury report as probable for Sunday's game against Buffalo due to a minor hamstring injury. He would likely start in place of Terrell Owens if the latter is unable to play. Streets is a marginal starter to begin with, and only if Owens is clearly not going to play.

Jimmy Kleinsasser <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=133340&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Kleinsasser will not play Sunday against Pittsburgh and could miss a few more games due to a high ankle sprain, according to published reports. He isn't much of a Fantasy factor to begin with, so this news probably doesn't affect your lineup decisions this week.

Daunte ! Cu! lpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=133263&> , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/01/01
According to published reports, Culpepper practiced on Friday despite a knee injury. He is expected to start Sunday's game against Pittsburgh, but will be only about 70 percent healthy and will have severely limited mobility in the game. Culpepper is a very risky start this week, so don't use him unless you don't have a viable alternative.

Cameron Cleeland <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Cleeland practiced with the scout team on Friday despite an ankle injury, according to published reports. However, he is not expected to play Sunday, so expect Boo Williams to start at tight end once again. Use Williams and not Cleeland this week.
Frank Sanders <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Sanders will travel with the Cardinals for Sunday's game against Oakland despite a hamstring, according to published reports. However, he is a gametime decision, so hold off on using him this week.

David Sloan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1331&>, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
According to published reports, Sloan said Friday that he has a slight tear of the medial collateral ligament in his knee. He has not been able to practice all week and most likely will not play Sunday against Chicago. Keep Sloan on your bench this week.! 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/01/01
Owens was able to practice Friday for the first time this week due to foot and ankle sprains, according to the Contra Costa Times. He will be re-evaluated Saturday to see if he has any lingering stiffness, and remains questionable for Sunday's game against Buffalo. If Owens does not play, he would only miss one week, according to Head Coach Steve Mariucci. Unless it becomes clear he will play before you need to make a lineup decision, you should probably reserve him for this week.

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/01/01
Barlow missed Friday's practice due to a shoulder injury, according to the Contra Costa Times. He is unlikely to play Sunday against Buffalo, and you shouldn't use him this week as a result.

Kevin Dyson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 11/30/01
Dyson is recovering from a toe injury, but is expected to play Sunday. He is listed as questionable. Don't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. The injury will likely slow him down a bit. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 11/30/01
Even though George's stats have been on the decline it will be hard to find a better running back on waivers. George has struggled recently but is still a must-start every week. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/30/01
Wycheck, still suffering from an ankle injury is expected to play in Sunday's game. However, he is listed as questionable. Don't expect him to be too productive. 

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/30/01
Ward doesn't score often, but has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year. He will always pos! t ! respectable totals so keep him in your lineup every week. 

Kyle Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect him to be too productive. Check and see if there is a more productive tight end on the waiver wires before settling on him. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 11/30/01
Despite his recent troubles off the field, Smith is still one of the best receivers. Look for him to catch some passes this week and be a solid No. 2 wideout. 

Tim Couch <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Couch has been solid this season despite the lack of a solid No. 2 wideout. He will be a good pickup if you are looking for starting QB. 

Quincy Morgan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=235232&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Morgan might regain his starting job this week, but don't expect him to be too productive. He has only caught 22 passes this season, two of which are TDs. 

Darnay Scott!  <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1212&>, WR CIN - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Don't expect Scott to be too productive this week. He only has two TD catches this season. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Expect Grbac to have a solid game this week against the Colts. Indianapolis has allowed 17 TD passes this season. 

Travis Taylor <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=187399&>, WR BAL - Russell Updated 11/30/01
Taylor has been unproductive this season. However, he could experience some success this week against a shaky Colts defense. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 11/30/01
Hasselbeck has been playing well in recent weeks, but he isn't putting up great Fantasy numbers. He is looked upon to avoid mistakes, not to win games for Seattle. As a result, Hasselbeck isn't worth more than a reserve role on your Fantasy team. 

Darrell Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/30/01
Jackson has been playing well in recent weeks, and he should have another good week against San Diego. The Chargers pass defense has been in question in recent weeks, so starting Jackson in deeper leagues is ! ad! visable. 

Charlie Garner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/30/01
Garner is a must-start against Arizona in Week 12. He faces a great matchup against the Cardinals, who have one of the worst defenses in the entire league. 

Jerry Rice <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 11/30/01
Rice still has plenty of life in his 39 year old legs, and he'll prove it on Sunday against Arizona. The Cards are one of the worst teams in the league against the pass, so starting Rice in Week 12 is advisable. 

Tim Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/30/01
Brown should have a field day against Arizona on Sunday. The Cardinals secondary is very vulnerable to solid passing teams, so look for the veteran wideout to have a big day. 

Tom Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 11/30/01
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, so starting him in Week 12 is a wise move.

236,"Stella and Charlotte, 

I looked into this deal.  We sold this gas for one day only.  In MOPS, the 
path was nominated for 1/26 only.  However, in POPS the path was nominated 
and confirmed for 1/26-1/31.  This should have been showing up as a 
bridgeback error during the month.  Also, someone should have identified that 
the path/nom in MOPS wasn't the same as the nom in POPS.  This discrepancy 
should have been found before we closed out January.

I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id 
in POPS, finding it in MOPS, and checking the audit on the path in MOPS).  
This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group, 
who has all the necessary tools to find the problem.  The resolution, not the 
problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an 
explanation of what happened.  Some one still needs to find out how the gas 
was confirmed for the 27th-31st.

Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the 
OBA.  Unless you can find a missing transport contract.

Well, I don't know what I'm going to do.  We will have a Texas Desk, but I 
don't really want to continue here.  I may look into Brenda's group (Pulp, 
Paper, Lumber, Steel).  I will most likely interview with AEP to see what 
they have to offer, but it has to be very good in order for me to leave the 
Evil Empire.  I am just glad they finally anounced the sale.  Some folks are 
upset and concerned about the whole deal, but I'm glad it's happened.

Anyway, I meant to let you know how our Christmas went with the boys.  Cole 
loved everything.  He had a great time and was sad to see Christmas come to 
an end.  Jake is a little different.  We spent $60 on a couple of things for 
him.  He hasn't touched them more than twice.  He found his new favorite toy 
the day after Christmas:  it's one of those soft cooler things you carry your 
lunch in.  He found that in the bottom of our pantry and now carries it 
around everywhere.  Now we have these two big plastic things just taking up 
more room in our already crowded house.

We started our house hunting last week.  I think this is going to be a long 
process.  Tonya's out looking today.  I'm letting her make the first cut.  I 
will come in on the second round.  We will probably put our house on the 
market in a couple of weeks.  We have a few small things we want to clean up, 
fix, etc., before we list it.  According to the other sales in the 
neighborhood, we should make a little money.

I hope everything is going well with you and the family.

Well, the folks are fine.  But, they have a few friends who lost just about 
everthing.  In fact, one family found only a couple of boxes of salvagable(?)

homes were reduced to rubble with very little left to save.  It was very 
bad.  What made it worse was the freezing weather coming in.  When we talked

 Have you been battling those Christmas mobs?  I took friday and Monday off

be cussing everyone out at Christmas...I think I hate people now...I think

except that he wants to rip every ornament off of the tree and eat it.  We've 
told him ""no"" so much that he shakes his head back and forth and smiles while 
he's grabbing for one.  He is a handful.  Jake has also started taking

We need to talk about the ability of ENA to continue its the current role as agent of Tenaska IV.

1)  Since the end on November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions.  We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.

2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.  I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan.  We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.

I don't know how Enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.  But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.

discussion with Duke, TXU Fuel Co. does not have a transportation agreement 
with
Duke for the redelivery of this gas.  The agreement is between Enron and Duke.
According to Brian Kerns of Duke, they basically took assignment of the 
existing
transportation agreement Enron had with PG&E (now El Paso).  If this is the
case, then we should be using the nominated amount as the driver towards 
meeting
our monthly minimum purchase obligation.  Any imbalance between Enron and Duke
on the Duke system receipts would be transparent to TXU and worked out between
Enron and Duke.  Any imbalance between the nominated volumed and the actual
volumes received at the ""Teco Tap"" would need to be worked out between Enron

367,"Vance:

Per our conversation, we have two possible options to resolve this deal, 
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not.

Producing:  If that is the case, the purchase from Calpine, and any contracts 
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level.  
Once that is done, I will need to research in the system how those wellheads 
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your Calpine deal.  This will 
probably have to go back to HPLC's ownership of HPLR's gathering assets.

Non-producing:  Should we determine that the Common Point and any wells 
behind it have been shut-in, or P&A'd, we will need to reallocate this deal 
to zero, and unwind any hedges against it (or, move the hedges to another 
deal, if possible.  Since the deal is older, we probably sold lower priced 
contracts against the production and a buy-back today would possibly result 
in a financial loss).  

In either case, the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow 
at meter 4229, which I am currently looking into.  I will email you as soon 
as I ascertain that date.

In lieu of the past couple of days, we may need to look at all of the deals 
which were impacted by HPLC's aquisition of HPLR's gathering to ensure that 
they are being captured properly, both at a book level and at a state filing 
level.  Please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish 
this.

The issue is that the 4229 meter has been terminated in the system, per 
Cheryl Jones, effective 2/00.  Therefore, any purchases at that point, for 
02/00 forward, are UA4 and are probably having a negative impact on your 
accrual.  I think perhaps this deal should be backed up to a wellhead level?  
There have not been any measured volumes at 4229 since its termination, so, I 
don't know where exactly the term Calpine deal is, physically.  Your 
assistance in clearing this up is greatly appreciated.

In order to calculate the VA we need the actual VisuPro counter data since we 
are using an assumed formula for the Vestas Availability.  (See attached for 
this year 2002 VA):



Note this report was an interim report and the ""EA"" values used for 
comparison does include the 90 day ramp up time and the Trent leaning towers.

With regard to the German turbines: If the German team has summarized data 
then we could make the calculation, with some simplifying assumptions, for 
the year 2001 on the German turbines and extend the graph.  By summarized 
data I am talking about a summation of each of the counter values for all of 
their turbines for all of the months during last year.  (This is not totally 
unreasonable, we could provide this data for turbines in the US very quickly 
but that is because we have the data in an Oracle database.)  

If, however, the data comes to us as individual VisuPro files it would be 
impossible to assimilate and produce the report before AWEA.  In fact I would 
not recommend trying to produce this number even after AWEA because of the 
complexity of the process.

We will pose the question to the German team but I am not optimistic that 
they have summarized counter data.

Best Regards,
Hollis


*  One simplifying assumption goes back to the fact the European VisuPro 
SCADA system has 4 counters which are defined differently than the 7 US 
counters.  We would need to assume the German grid never went down and was 
always available.  If we were unable to make this assumption then we would 
need to load all the error messages from each individual turbine in Germany 
and isolate the time associated with grid events (i.e. error messages 8 
Overvoltage 9 ""Undervoltage"", 10 ""Underfrequency"", 11 ""Overfrequency"", 116 
""Line fault voltage"", 117 ""Line fault frequency"") and back that time out of 
RT and apply it to SOT.

420,"Ilan,

Per your request here is the VA with the leaning towers removed and the 90 
day ramp up also removed.

Discounting the leaning towers, there is a slight variation (generally<.1%) 
between the EA term in this report and the EA term in the reports the owners 
may have seen.  This is because the owner reports are corrected for SCADA 
counter resets while this dataset is not.  We are in the process of 
implementing a fix for this variation which includes storing the validated 
counter data in our database but that will not be complete before the AWEA 
meeting.

If you show this data to owners at AWEA the folks from Trent may object as 
they will consider our availability should include leaning towers.  By the 
same token the sites where we did not negotiate a 90 day ramp up may object 
as our availability should include the turbines from commissioning.

Do you have any information on the LKM files created by Visupro.  My 
understanding and review of these files suggests they store a reference power 
curve, and an accumulated wind speed distribution and power.

Question:
1. Do you know if this reference curve is turbine, site, or generic 
specific?  If turbine or site, is it an engineering or warranted curve?  Who 
manages the input of the curve data?

2. I assume the wind distribution is derived from the nacelle anemometer.  Do 
you know if the data has all the same transformations applied as they do in 
the Minana file?

3.  How is the power value derived for the corresponding wind speed in the 
distribution?  Also, how is the reference power for this distribution derived?

I am trying to determine if we need to develop a reference power curve table 
for the Crystal Report application.

Here is the answer to your question about the undocumented fault messages 
(those without text descriptions). They should not influence the statistical 
counters (""turbine OK"" still increments after the faults occur) and do not 
effect the behavior of the turbine. 

-Garth

",Mark,,
431,"Hi Mark,

I discussed the issue of releasing fault related information to our customers 
(specifically, Zilka) with Kevin. We feel that the information about which 
statistical counters increment during specific faults can be released to 
them. When it comes to specific faults and the circumstances under which they 
occur, the only documentation that goes into any detail is the controller 
document published by the controls group in Rheine. We don't want to release 
the entire document (for obvious reasons) and the information on the cause of 
the faults and related parametes is in the above mentioned document. (We got 
the information for the ""Error identification"" column from Section 2.2 of 
""Software Description EW1.5 Bachmann-M1"".)To interpret this information, they 
would also need the parameter list and we do have parameter lists specific to 
Mill Run and Somerset that are being released through document control this 
week. (I've attached a master parameter list that is not specific to a given 
site. The values in this list may not be exactly the same as the actual 
settings at Mill Run/Somerset).


(This document can be released to the customer)


(This document can be released BUT it is not specific to the customer's site. 
The site specific lists scheduled to be released this week...)


(You can use this to answer specific questions that the customer has but DO 
NOT release this to the customer- for internal use only.) 

I hope this information helps out in your discussion with Zilka.

446,"Please familiarize yourself with GE's Mail retention Policy.  It is 
substantially different from what we are used to.

--D

GE's Mail Retention Policy

E-mail is a tremendous productivity tool, but its volume and use carry with
it a number of issues. Keeping up with the volume of e-mail is burdensome,
indeed often stressful. The unnecessary retention of e-mail uses valuable IT
resources, and the volume of unnecessary e-mail slows down our ability to
process and find the materials we really need. Importantly, recent court
cases illustrate how e-mails, which are so useful because of their
informality and speed, can become the subject of intense scrutiny over
meanings the authors may never have intended. Words and phrases intended to
be ironic, sarcastic or amusing can be taken out of context with
embarrassing - and unintentionally harmful - consequences.
  (1) Proper document retention is one important way to
control these burdens and risks. Our company policy has been to discard
unneeded e-mail after 30 days. To implement this policy, we are, beginning
September 1, 1999, instituting automatic deletion of e-mail in primary
e-mail folders (Inbox, Outbox, Sent Items, Drafts) company-wide after 30
days. In addition, e-mails stored in other folders will be deleted after 365
days. Finally, you should save e-mails on your local hard-drive only where
it is essential (the auto-delete will not operate on the local hard drive).
  These automatic deletion procedures will be subject to legal
limits on document destruction, limits that apply to e-mails. When an
employee's e-mail is potentially relevant to litigation or threatened
litigation, counsel for your business will cause the automatic suspend
feature to be disabled for an appropriate time period. A second limitation
involves retention of certain records required by law in such areas as tax,
EHS, government contracts. Such limitations will be implemented on a
business-by-business basis and in corporate components.
  Accordingly, for employees in the businesses, your General
Counsel and Messaging Leader will be in touch with you about implementation
of the auto delete feature in the next week or so. For corporate employees,
Brackett Denniston and David Etue will provide further guidance shortly.
  (2) But proper document retention practices represent only
part of the answer to minimizing the risk that e-mails will be misunderstood
or used improperly by our adversaries. The best solution, of course, is to
ensure that we compose our e-mail carefully and sensibly, just as we would
any other written communication. In that regard, we are attaching a list of
tips and best practices. Following these suggestions and practices will
improve the clarity of our communications and address their volume as well.
We believe that we can improve the use and productivity by taking the time
to write e-mail intelligently, and by retaining only those e-mails required
by law.
Thanks for your help.

Targeted at current small commercial customers enrolled in one of Commonwealth Edison's

470,"There are several ambiguities and operational issues with this definition.   

SOT:  First, the phrase ""available to operate without a status condition or 
fault that would otherwise limit its operation"" in SOT is very easily 
misunderstood.  Many owners & I.E.'s think that ""System Okay"" means the 
turbine should produce power, as per the power curve,  during every second of 
SOT.  This isn't true.    If the turbine is paused offline or manually 
stopped, untwisting cables, resetting, undergoing a load shutdown,  in low 
noise operation, or  in spinning or starting up mode, then the SOT clock is 
incremented even though the turbine can't produce power.  I think the SOT 
description should read something like""not faulted off for turbine 
malfunction or offline for failed turbine systems.""  Either that or call this 
counter something other than ""System Okay"".   

DT:  The phrase ""or that is counted as Weather Out Time"" may confuse the 
owner.  According to SCADA training if a downtime fault occurs at the same 
time as a ""weather out"" condition then the turbine fault (DT) will have 
precedence.    This precedence may be hard to explain to owner.  Therefore, I 
recommend you delete the Weather out phrase.  In other words, stop the 
sentance on Majeure Events.

LOT:   Precedence also can cause confusion here.  If a turbine fault occurs 
when the grid is outside of specs we've been told that DT will always take 
precedence whether the grid induced the fault or the fault occurred due to 
turbine malfunction not related to the grid.  How does the controller 
distinguish (and analysts from ten minute SCADA data) whether the fault was 
due to the grid or the grid was driven out of spec by a turbine malfunction?  
I recommend that you replace the phrase ""except where line conditions are 
forced out of specs due to Turbine malfunction"" with "" except when the 
turbine faults offline.""  Further, it should be noted that when the turbine 
faults off due to grid variations then it probably is true that EWC is 
penalized for the grid variations.   

MT:  How do we implement the 36 hour limit on MT in the equation?  I assume 
that we compute a value MTexcess that is that portion of MT in excess of the 
36 hour limit.   Then we use MTexcess in the numerator instead of MT to 
penalize EWC for exceeding the MT limit.   Where did 36 hours come from?   
The previous limit in all existing 1.5 contracts is 48 hours and MT, as 
defined by the controller fault listing, includes several other tasks that 
are not on a scheduled maintenance  checklist.   The 48 hours per year was 
intended only to capture those tasks on the maintenance checklist.

WOT:  How does the controller know when the turbine can't be repaired due to 
weather related events or that weather makes access unsafe?   If it can't 
then you are adding an activity that must be tracked by manual log and 
integrated into availability computations by a manual procudure that is not 
value added to the customer and costly to operator.

EOT:  What about icing sensor shutting down turbine?   This isn't due to 
Owner.   

ST:  This definition of ST rarely equals the total number of hours in the  
""survey or measurement"" period  due to communication losses and power 
outages.   I recommend you  remove that phrase from the definition OR alter 
the definition of availability to (SURVEY - DT - RT - MT)/(SURVEY - 
MTprorated).    SURVEY is the maximum possible number of hours in the survey 
period and MTprorated is the percent of 36 hours per year in the survey 
period.  I recommend keeping the current availability definition as it uses 
info already in Visupro. 

Availability equation as shown doesn't penalize EWC for MT above the 36 hour 
limit.   See MT above for solution.

I have attached the April Log with some corrections to the curtailments.  The 
lines I shaded blue are typing errors that I fixed.  These will account for 
the negative hours and the turbines with no data. 

 The turbines that are showing hours but no production must be a result of a 
SCADA data acquisition problem.  These entries I shaded in red.  I started 
looking through the list in the April Log but I could not find any errors on 
our side, so you may have to base the lost production on what a particular

 Per our phone conversation, Mark Fisher and myself have been discussing 
availability with Gary from Zilkha. A question arose regarding the many 
operations of our breaker in the pad mounted transformer that took place 
December through March. Gary's thought is that when we recalculate the 
availability, we need to count these times as down time and not Line Out 
Hours as they have currently been counted. I suggested that according to 
Exhibit GG in the TSIA, LOH is defined in short as any time the grid does not 
meet ""(i) the specifications required by the WTG as set forth in the 
Technical Specifications"", and Gary agrees with this. The problem is that an 
engineering change on the breaker settings was implemented some time in March 
to reduce the number of breaker operations on site. We are still seeing many 
grid faults in the turbine but not in the PMT breaker. The question that Gary 
brought up is were the original settings of the breaker set to the WTG 
Technical Specifications and operating due to the on going grid conditions OR 
were the settings improper to start with causing the breaker to operate while 
the grid was within Technical Specifications.","Kurt Mark Fisher Gary Gary

Attached is the Curtail200206.db file. I have a question about a sequence of 
events. For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is ""Energy curtailed"" 
(Index = 10843), THEN it has the message ""Turbine Com Established"" (Index = 
10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a ""Energy 
curtailed"" message (Index = 11134).

Is there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment 
messages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established 
message was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no 
message was recorded? 

Thanks,

following work is in response to your findings regarding availability 
incrementing with no power production above cut in wind speeds, conveyed 
through both Kurt Anderson and through Mark Fisher's meeting with you in

I wasn't sure where 15A was going to fall out in the new world so . . . update on 20R- so some people will be in the know.

Per conversations with Carrie Chaffin, I have learned that all construction interest has been moved off of 20R and onto 15A. 

 I have received detail of 20R's interest income acct (SAP# 62000000).  The detail confirms that this activity is no longer on 20R.

On 20R's 2000 return, we reversed the construction interest income.  And- we had to reduce the depreciation taken on these assets for tax.  We did this by depreciating the construction interest amount as a negative depreciation.  This was done to reduce the tax basis being depreciated by the construction interest not recognized for tax.

I am assuming that  we will reverse the construction interest income on 15A since that is where it is being recorded.  Celeste- you might want to see if you can find this on your SAP ledger for next close- or leave a note to whoever is taking over 15A.

My questions is how are we going to handle the depreciation issue.  Because- isn't it our understanding that the basis is still on 20R?

Also- since we reversed the interest income on 20R in 2000 as a temporary item- I guess we are going to have to transfer the tax balance associated with the M-1 to 15A at some point??  So- that it can be tracked to turn.  At what point it is appropriate to do that?

to Vestas nor is it based on any Vestas contractual availability.   This 
availability is a multi- industry standard for simple ""series component"" 
availability.   There is no credit for maintenance or repair time time which 
is why a 3-5% loss is considered acceptable for long term performance.   The 
3-5% loss includes maintenance.   An availability metric that shows the 
turbine as available during repairs would be very objectionable to future 
owners.    Pausing the turbine during maintenance may be acceptable if the 
long term goal is set accordingly.   For example, if the turbine is always 
paused during maintenance then the long term system goal should be close to 
the 99.5% goal for grid availability.

In an earlier e-mail Ben made the statement:  ""Have you been able to 
determine what these numbers would look like using Vestas' definition of 
availability:  Hours of Wind Turbine in Operation mode X 100 / Hours of Grid 
in Operation Mode."" 

We now need to develop a methodology to calculate the Vestas definition using 
VisuPro data.  I think this boils down to:

Vestas Avail = (SOT+WOT+EST+RT+MT)/(ST-LOT)

Where:

SOT = System Okay Time
EST = External Stop Time
WOT = Weather Out Time
LOT = Line Out Time
DT = Down Time
RT = Repair Time
MT = Maintenance Time

ST = SOT+EST+WOT+LOT+DT+RT+MT

This calculation is based on an operating assumption that the current day 
machines are placed into ""pause"" mode during maintenance and repair time.  As 
a result the availability counters will continue to increment even when the 
turbine is being serviced.  

Let's get together and discuss,

Mark Ratekin has in his possession an IEC standard power curve for the

Perhaps Mark Ratekin can forward this curve to Mark Fisher for this type of

530,"Please familiarize yourself with GE's Mail retention Policy.  It is 
substantially different from what we are used to.

--D

GE's Mail Retention Policy

E-mail is a tremendous productivity tool, but its volume and use carry with
it a number of issues. Keeping up with the volume of e-mail is burdensome,
indeed often stressful. The unnecessary retention of e-mail uses valuable IT
resources, and the volume of unnecessary e-mail slows down our ability to
process and find the materials we really need. Importantly, recent court
cases illustrate how e-mails, which are so useful because of their
informality and speed, can become the subject of intense scrutiny over
meanings the authors may never have intended. Words and phrases intended to
be ironic, sarcastic or amusing can be taken out of context with
embarrassing - and unintentionally harmful - consequences.
  (1) Proper document retention is one important way to
control these burdens and risks. Our company policy has been to discard
unneeded e-mail after 30 days. To implement this policy, we are, beginning
September 1, 1999, instituting automatic deletion of e-mail in primary
e-mail folders (Inbox, Outbox, Sent Items, Drafts) company-wide after 30
days. In addition, e-mails stored in other folders will be deleted after 365
days. Finally, you should save e-mails on your local hard-drive only where
it is essential (the auto-delete will not operate on the local hard drive).
  These automatic deletion procedures will be subject to legal
limits on document destruction, limits that apply to e-mails. When an
employee's e-mail is potentially relevant to litigation or threatened
litigation, counsel for your business will cause the automatic suspend
feature to be disabled for an appropriate time period. A second limitation
involves retention of certain records required by law in such areas as tax,
EHS, government contracts. Such limitations will be implemented on a
business-by-business basis and in corporate components.
  Accordingly, for employees in the businesses, your General
Counsel and Messaging Leader will be in touch with you about implementation
of the auto delete feature in the next week or so. For corporate employees,
Brackett Denniston and David Etue will provide further guidance shortly.
  (2) But proper document retention practices represent only
part of the answer to minimizing the risk that e-mails will be misunderstood
or used improperly by our adversaries. The best solution, of course, is to
ensure that we compose our e-mail carefully and sensibly, just as we would
any other written communication. In that regard, we are attaching a list of
tips and best practices. Following these suggestions and practices will
improve the clarity of our communications and address their volume as well.
We believe that we can improve the use and productivity by taking the time
to write e-mail intelligently, and by retaining only those e-mails required
by law.
Thanks for your help.

Attached is an update/reconciliation of the March numbers for Trent and Clear 
Sky.  As you can see the predicted wind energy, based on the actual wind 
speeds for the month, is approximately 20% higher for Trent than it is for 
Clear Sky.  This was a result of the average wind speeds (see monthly 
reports) being 14% higher at Trent: 7.69 m/s vs. 8.8 m/s.  Note that the 
power as wind speeds increase skews the variance in energy higher than the 
variance in wind speeds.

The attached file, Clearskypavout0302,  contains the production and 
availability data based on Visupro recorded data.   The turbine production in 
March and Jan are within 0.3% of the substation value assuming a 2% line 
loss.   February is still lower than the substation after all of the 
corrections used in March and January were applied.    The turbines which had 
a meter reset in March were 17, 44, 59, and 93.    The meter resets were 
corrected for.   Also corrected were turbines 32 and 42 which had a 
communication loss at the beginning of March and turbines 69, 70, 71, 77, 82 
- 93, 96, 100, 102, 103, 104-109, and 113-122 which had a communication loss 
at the end of March.  A final correction was made to turbine 42 which had an 
improper Visupro address during the early part of March.  
The availability rose above 90% even though the production was disappointing 
due to frequent curtailments.  There were no corrections for force majeure

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""twea=
ks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

I am interested in speaking with you further concerning investment opportunities.     Although you mentioned that  the $1,800  (the amount in my account) is a small sum,  I have been reluctant to invest more money with your firm,   given to performance of the suggestions provided previously.   
I have been a market maker in the electricity business and I realize that no one is right all of the time;    I dont expect this.      However,   I do expect some consistent contact from a broker  who has been successful in his own trading, not just success in brokering trades.      My view will be that the more success we have,  the more money I will be willing to invest.

I am interested in discussing my specific financial situation with you  and learning more about you, your track record and your abilities.
I do wish to talk about covered calls on specific options that I have expiring in January.    I would also like to discuss any other profitable ideas that fit my profile.

Heres the kicker:   the guy is asking $27,500 negotiable.     I think I can get this for $24,500 or 25k.         It needs tires and one of the headlight lenses has a rock chip.   The car drives great.

Do you know of anything that I need to look out for with this particular model?   The engine is a 3.6 litre and it runs great.    Can a detail shop get out smudges and waterspots?   The blue book trade in on this vehicle in good condition is $24,000.   The retail is supposedly $33k.
What am I missing here?

I had tried to reconstruct Sunday the 24th based upon your notes,  but was unsuccessful.    I am going to need you to spend some time straightening this out.     Enpower is out of balance  and the books are as well.  
Risk management/Settlements wants this balanced,  as we cannot tie out with our customers.

We will probably need to restore Enpower to precut status,  then initiate the proper deal entry to handle the cuts that came in.

You mention inadvertancy in your Notes,  but I dont know the particulars of this problem.    I'm sure you are aware that every cut needs to be reflected in Enpower.     If you were in balance when you arrived for your shift,   then you should be in balance when you leave.
The Real Time position manager is used to check whether this happened or not.

Give me a call to straighten this out.

I spoke with Steve directly about Kevin's e-mail and concerns.    Steve said that Dan of C.O.B contacted him,  inquiring about job opportunities here.     Steve did mention to Dan that ""someone"" from their shop had already inquired.   He was not specific.    Dan,  evidently,  figured who this was (not very hard)  and spread the word at the COB office.   Subsequently,   Dan and Brandon sent their resumes.

I have spoken directly with Steve about this issue.  I also have put out a note to the group which I copied you on.    Clearly,  this is unacceptable and Steve has apologized.

How do you feel about this:   
if we hire Kevin,  then this problem somewhat goes away.    I need someone immediately and Kevin could be plugged right in,  similar to Alex.     I know that Kevin may not be a solid fit for the trader track program,  but I am needing some help pretty quick.

For all that have missed the floor meeting,   we have been downgraded to ""junk"" status,  ending our merger plans and crushing our stock price.
A likely scenario would have us declaring bankruptcy within a few days.     Payroll is said to be funded until the end of the month, at least.   
If bankruptcy is filed,  payroll should be covered.
Another very real option is that the trading floor could be parcelled and sold to an outside company.   There are discussion underway that deal with this possibility.

Currently,  we are not trading.    We need to continue to report to work and keep a log of Real Time prices.    Continue to update the Hourly Prices sheet for a record of prices.    We may need these prices as support for liquidated damages.

More counterparties will be defaulting and cutting schedules.     Please make note of such cuts and prepare to bill LD's.   We have prepared a cut log for this purpose.

For tomorrow, see the attached schedule.     This is what is communicated to Frontera.     The mw value at the top of the page indicates what their total generation should be by hour.   The Resource Plan shuold be identical to this row.       Row 5 mirrors the purchase from Frontera in Enpower.     The Mirant call and Enron's call (Ercot Asset Book - 100 mw's) are listed as well as any daily trades executed on behalf of Frontera.    Please familiarize yourself with this report    

The top line will indicate how much power is available for bal-day sales,  etc.    Additionally,   the Resource Plan needs to accurately reflect to Ercot what the plant is capable of.  For example,   if we are generating at the maximum of 450 mw's,  we need to reflect that the combined maximums on units 1-3   do not exceed this amount.

Otherwise,  Ercot thinks they can OOM you up.


Specifically for tomorrow,   please note that we are going from 135 mw hour ending 6 to 250 mw's hour ending 7.     The plant doesnt like to do this.  A 200 mw schedule would be much more preferrable for this ramp.
So either :
1.  purchase 50 mw's from RT market for he 7.    Change Resource Plan to 200 mw's for hour ending 7 only.  Put purchase from  in  Teco Services book.
Make another corresponding sale to Frontera counterparty in the Teco Services book.   If you dont make the second entry in Enpower the Teco Services book will be long for hour ending 7.
2. have plant drag  and buy imbalance - they will call to make this decision.  No entries will be needed.

Call if you have questions.

Mark,
Hope all is well in Taylor.    I have a couple of questions about OOMC capacity payments.    As discussed in our meeting,  I received a manual OOMC on Thursday 9/13 (10:30 pm)  from Terry at the ISO.
He reserved 220 mw of capacity from the Frontera unti for hours ending 9-2400 for Friday,  Sept 14th.

We were,  indeed,   exercised on Friday.    I think that we understand the payment for the energy portion of the exercise.

However,  we are not certain what we will be paid for the capacity portion,  as the formula for OOMC payment is based upon the Replacement reserve market.
The replacement reserve prices have been zero.

689,"The attached files contains our daily volume requirements for  5/31 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    In each file there are three  worksheets
labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\JUN_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':

Please note that for the month of June '00 CES is purchasing additional 
volumes
of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate deal.  The
volumes shown here are entirely separate from the aforementioned deal.

make sure and run the proposed details/rules of any real time market you are 
working on by Kevin Presto and Tim Belden before Enron agrees or proposes 
anything.  Kevin wants to have the generation curve and demand curve 
available.   However, there are many ways to set up such a market and the 
traders need to be involved (maybe with another meeting later).  For example, 
there are different ways of the dispatcher responding to bids, such as set 
point dispatch or sending out a price signal (what PJM does)--(probably many 
other methods too.)  In addition, Kevin does not like the way that NY can 
take out of merit generators.

Common Questions


1.  Where can I find online documentation on Concur Expense?

Library.   Go to the following link:
http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp  and click on the XMS - 
Concur Expense folder on the left.

2. How can I sign up for Concur Expense training and how much does it cost?
Answer: Go to the following link: 
http://iscedcenter.enron.com/docentlm/login.htm.  Log in using your Enron

This will show the training schedule.  Click the Enroll button to sign up for 
a class.  The cost is $250.

3. Will old XMS expense reports be converted to the new Concur Expense system?
Answer: No.  History data was not converted to the new system because of our 
move to an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution for Concur Expense.

4. How can I view my old expense reports?
Answer: Call the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.  The ISC will be 
responsible for printing out old expense reports and forwarding them to you.  
Other options are being reviewed to allow you to view old expense reports.

5. Are there any Enron specific help instructions for Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Enron 
Help on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also 
you will see a button for Enron Help at the top of the screen when entering

Answer: Yes. If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Travel 
Policy on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also 
you will see a button for Travel Policy at the very top of the screen when 
entering expense reports

7. What if I am unable to see any of my credit card charges in Concur Expense?
Answer: Since there are a number of factors that could cause this problem, it 
is best to call the ISC Customer Care group first.  The ISC will research the 
problem and get back to you with an answer.

8. Does Concur Expense have a time-out feature?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense will automatically time out after 20 minutes of 
inactivity.

9. How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense?
Answer: Go to the ISC Document Library described in #1 above.  Go to the XMS

following the directions stated in the document called Add a Foreign Currency 
Expense to an Expense Report.

Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense provides a Quick Tour for new users.  Log into 
Concur Expense and click the Help button in the top right corner of the 
screen.  Then click the button labeled Quick Tour at the top of the help 
screen.  The ISC intranet home page also contains some helpful information.  
The following link summarizes some of the topics discussed above:  
http://isc.dev.corp.enron.com/site/XMSchange.htm.

11. Can you quickly describe some of the internal changes in the new Concur 
Expense system?
Answer:  There are minimal changes in the new upgrade.  Here is a list:
? The first screen only has one tab instead of two
? New expense types were added
? Attendees and approvers will now be printed on the expense reports
? Manager and receipt dunning notices will be sent out
? The statistical order and statistical WBS element fields have been 
separated out

715,"Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The CA ISO has received a number of requests for historic unit specific
outage information, consistent with the outage data that is posted daily on
the CA ISO website.  Because the CA ISO has determined that there are no
legal or policy reasons to treat this information as confidential, the CA
ISO will provide such data in response to the requests (and any subsequent
requests).  Unless there is a change to tariff section 20.3.2, the CA ISO
will NOT make publicly available generator outage programs submitted to the
CA ISO (i.e. information on planned prospective outages).  The CA ISO notes
that the historic information on generator outages that is in the CA ISO's
possession is highly unreliable until beginning of 2001.  While the CA ISO
will provide historic outage information in its possession in response to
properly submitted requests, the CA ISO does not and will not vouch for the
accuracy of data for years 1998, 1999 and 2000.

The CA ISO plans to begin disseminating historic outage data in response to
requests on Friday, March 30.  Any questions or concerns related to this

The short answers are:

A) only about $1.5 billion, if you believe the original Azurix profiles contained in the IPO model
B) about $2 billion if you can replicate our Cancun concession and actual experience there
C) about $3 billion if you believe you can earn a spread of 3.5% to 4.5% over capital cost
D) about $12 billion if you invest in the US water sector and earn a 1% spread over capital cost
E) about $28 billion if you invest in the UK water sector and earn a 0.25% spread over capital cost
F) all the capital in the universe (if you assume our experience in Buenos Aires)

All of these amounts are TOTAL capital amounts and could be leveraged by some amount of debt (50/50 seems reasonable?).  Additionally, these amounts assume an immediate up-front investment, rather than investing in several deals over time.  Investing over time would, obviously, require additional capital to achieve the same NPV.

The above scenarios (except for F) are contained in the attached spreadsheet.  We can flesh out a more detailed model to support these numbers, but I believe this gives us the range of potential answers.

        The ERMS system, as you know, has an excellent capability for 
decomposing option P&L into the following components:

new deals
curve shift
gamma
vega
theta
rho
drift
2nd order adjustments

What i dont understand is the gamma component which is reported in dollars.  
The unit of measure suggests that incremental changes in a contract position 
is being associated with specific prices.  These prices are the effective buy 
or sell prices associated with the dynamic delta position.  

Stated differently, the standard taylor expansion has incorporated a price 
variable in such a way as to convert the unit of measure from gamma's 
standard contract count to total gamma dolalrs.  This is something I dont 
understand.  To date, inquiries to the risk management accounting group has 
further revealed that the gamma component of P&L is not well understood.  

This is what concerns me: Bridgeline has 2 books with option exposures (NYMEX 
and Gas Daily).  Both books dynamically hedged its positions during 
yesterdays large price move and, through anticipitory hedging in advance or 
during the large price move, secured sufficient coverage to neutralize 
expected changes in delta.  However, our P&L from our underlying position did 
not offset our gamma P&L.  Consequently, I have to ask WHY?  Im hoping that a 
brief look at the why gamma dollars are calculated may reveal something which 
will better guide our hedging decisions.

thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the ""unnamed"" trader in the 
Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.  
Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:  ""The same people who colluded in 
the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it.""  No 
idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:

Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that 
Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state 
(SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government.
David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed ""Czar"" by the State of

virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were=
=20
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and=20
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even=
=20
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment=
,=20
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The=
=20
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are=
=20
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose=20
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commissi=
on=20
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open=20
Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to=
=20
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission=
=20
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,=20
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market=20
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an=
=20
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  I=
n=20
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase=
d=20
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one=20
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for=20
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants belie=
ve=20
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction=
=20
increased in the Midwest. =20

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of informati=
on=20
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules fo=
r=20
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission=20
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a=
nd=20
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and=20
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,=
=20
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs=
=20
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market=20
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully=
=20
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk advers=
e,=20
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted th=
at=20
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed=
=20
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the=20
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching=
=20
the Rules for Fun and Profit."")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,=20
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided=
=20
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp=
er=20
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, al=
l=20
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and=
=20
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO=20
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security=20
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region=
=20
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  Th=
e=20
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. =
=20
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC aud=
it=20
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is=20
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of=20
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially=
=20
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several are=
as=20
of non-compliance. =20

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,=
=20
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flo=
w=20
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information=
=20
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under=
=20
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a=20
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption=
=20
and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission coul=
d=20
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t=
he=20
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also=
,=20
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits=
=20
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to ha=
ve=20
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha=
ve=20
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide=
=20
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the=20
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the=20
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively""=20
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory=20
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants. =
=20
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,=
=20
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has=
=20
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the=
=20
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs=
=20
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d=
ue=20
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,=20
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and=20
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the=20
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development=
=20
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and=
=20
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has act=
ed=20
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the=
=20
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have=20
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to=20
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform=20
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant=20
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th=
is=20
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than=
=20
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were=20
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better=20
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased=20
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages. =20

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to=20
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to=
=20
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S=
E=20
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence=
=20
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be=20
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence=20
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes=
=20
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how=20
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns=
=20
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigatio=
n=20
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In=
=20
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff=
=20
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted. =
=20
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of=20
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access=20
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac=
k=20
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In=20
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission=20
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to=20
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied=
=20
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the=20
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.=
 =20
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting=20
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a=20
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without=20
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communicati=
on=20
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase rais=
es=20
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv=
e=20
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by=20
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC=20
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d=
o=20
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs=
=20
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  =
In=20
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.=
 =20
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated=
=20
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the=
=20
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- i=
e,=20
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same=20
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio=
n=20
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a=20
""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission=20
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal la=
w=20
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of=
=20
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong=20
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In=20
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff list=
s=20
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the=
=20
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park=
=20
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the=20
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential=
.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, includin=
g=20
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchan=
ge=20
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available t=
o=20
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an=
=20
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not=
=20
displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC=
=20
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine=20

NORTHEAST SUMMARY

Attached is a summary of FERC Staff=01,s November 1, 2000 report on its=20
investigation of the Northeast region.  The report is very encouraging=20
because it is comprehensive and recommends many of the changes and solution=
s=20
that Enron has been advocating for years.  The report is also encouraging=
=20
because it indicates a significant level of understanding of the northeast=
=20
markets (and the problems in these markets) by the FERC people who worked o=
n=20
this report.  Because this is only a brief summary, the entire report=20

806,"my two cents ....

I viewed the goal of the Management Committee as three-fold
1.  Measure management skill
2.  Ensure people with superior mgmt skills are appropriately recognized.
3.  Ensure best talent (however defined) are retained and have mgmt skills nurtured.

To expand on (1), ask the questions :
  (a) What attributes characterize a good manager?  From Louise's list, I would vote for Internal Alliances and Experience.
  (b) How can these be quantified, if at all?

To expand on (2), identify promotion/other opportunities for such people.

The following table summarizes the PV quantities associated with the three transportation contracts owned by the Navy Yard.  You may use this number to look at the impact of a 1 cent change in demand rates (unitized) on the value of the transaction.  Because pipeline demand charges do not flow as part of the sales price, an increase in the demand charge will result in a loss to the deal.  

As a reminder, the base valuation makes very reasonable (and conservative) assumptions regarding increases in pipeline demand charges over the term of the deal.

Please find the following Action Items for the Tech Services team stemming from today's DASH review meeting with L. Kitchen.   Bob V. can you take point on this with  D. Williams.   Mike Coleman attended the meeting in Dan's absence and can provide feedback on some of the technical discussion.

1.	Please develop a project schedule showing the inter-relationship between permitting, engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction and start-up activities.  Key issues include:
	a)	ability to get equipment ordered and delivered given vendor availability
	b)	inter-play between equipment purchasing and off balance sheet financing requirements.
	c)	delay in construction caused by a delay in the air permit
	d)	securing a construction permit - given that site remediation has not been signed off on by the state/city
	e)	construction activities in the winter
	f)	other permits required

2.	Provide a review of the O&M budget and long term performance factors to ensure we are comfortable with cost and plant performance used in the pro forma.

3.	Provide an assessment of the cost/ability to put in place an EPC contract to meet the pro forma assumptions (labor rates in NYC, unions, RAC requirements, etc).


As we have discussed, we need to be proactive in the DASH process and conduct a technical review meeting before the DASH is written and circulated.   This will ensure that we have identified and have addressed/modeled/mitigated/reserved for technical issues before the DASH is submitted to EWS management for signature.  Our Thursday meetings are a perfect platform for getting these issues out on the table.   This did not occur in the case of Brooklyn Navy Yard, and we were left scrambling trying to answer technical questions in respect of the DASH.  Much of the analysis was done, however, we need to present a clear review of technical risks and mitigation impacts of the project.  Failing to do so puts the project at risk and creates doubt that Tech Services has a firm grasp of the Technical Risk in ENA.  If there are issues getting access to information or you are being left out of the technical analysis in compiling the DASH please let me help.

As some of you may be aware, we appear to be getting close to entering a transaction with NSTAR to serve its all-requirements power needs for its Residential and Commercial customer class Default Service obligations.  The deal would be for a term of 6 or 12 months commencing July 1, 2001.  NSTAR's service territory covers Boston and surrounds, as well as south-eastern Massachusetts.  This prospective deal is very similar in nature to the Standard Offer Service deals we have entered into with United Illuminating, NSTAR, and most recently, Central Maine Power.

Here is the status at this point:
NSTAR achieved various levels of signoff for the basic deal structure (both with regulators and internal senior management).  NSTAR has indicated that it has basically come down to price and they could potentially pull the trigger as early as Monday, but certainly within a couple of days at the most.
NSTAR has requested updated pricing by 10 AM Eastern on Monday 3/26 to be held firm through COB same day (contingent upon execution of definitive agreements by that time).  They are seeking pricing updates from competing suppliers so we are not exclusive at this point.
NSTAR/Enron have worked through our extensive markups on their proposed contract, and have compiled a list of outstanding contract issues. (Note: Marcus Nettelton has been leading our legal efforts on this deal, and can be reached at 5-8161 to discuss contract issues).   While the number of outstanding contract items are numerous at this point, my sense is that there are no real deal breakers on either their end or ours.  In fact, they have agreed to many of the open issues in our previous contract with them for Standard Offer Service, so they could potentially agree to our terms without much delay, thereby potentially making execution on Monday a possibility.

Attached is a draft DASH for this deal .  I request that you review it promptly with a goal to have each of your signoffs for this deal in principle by mid-afternoon on Monday so as to enable us to transact on Monday if necessary.  The parameters that are still in motion are:  (1) price (again to e updated Monday morning), but will maintain same NPV value; (2) term (they may end up just going for 6 months); and (3) exact volume they source from us.  As for volume, they indicated they may want to go with us for something less than 100% of their requirements for the first 6 months (they estimate anywhere between 50-100%), and then potentially a smaller percentage for the second 6 months if they do end up doing a 12-month deal.  

Please feel free to call me (978-449-9936 office, 978-448-9260 home over the weekend) if you would like to discuss in more detail.   Berney Aucoin in Structuring will be on point to run internal traps on Monday as may be necessary.  Thanks in advance.

I unfortunately was not able to attend your meeting this morning as I was interviewing analyst candidates, however the overall reaction from the group seems to be positive and I applaud you for your efforts in setting the tone.

I realize the company is in an interesting position with respect to liquidity and therefore I felt compelled to pass this thought by you with respect to a potential avenue power origination could pursue to assist with the current situation.  Since most of our activities seem to require some amount of capital, I was wondering whether you felt a viable strategy would be to turn Carl Tricoli's prepay concept for IPP's on its head and reverse the transaction with one or more counterparties where we pick up the upfront premium and deliver power in the future.  Assuming we can find the right counterparties, then we in essence would achieve a short position (which seems to be more in line with your strategic thoughts) and pick up liquidity in the short run.

Since our conversation today, I have discovered that by terminating the Reuters contract, we will lose the entire Headline News category, as well as the Stock Quotes, Sports News and Weather News.

Reuters costs over $80,000 per month. This pushes the cost of content for NewCo to over $360,000 for relatively little benefit.

Therefore, contrary to what we agreed earlier, I would like to drop all of the content on the right side of the quotes screen. We will adjust screen size or insert graphics accordingly to get things looking right until our Phase 3 expansion.

Please advise if you agree.

Outside of these risk related reports, Bob and his team have not provided reports or other documents to any of the potential suitors.  A few others on Bob Hall's team have had meetings with various due diligence teams and have discussed processes and controls, but again have not provided documents.  (I do, however, believe that in the case of at least one due diligence team that our monthly operations report was given to the due diligence team by someone outside Bob Hall's team.  I have not been able to confirm who within Enron provided that information.) 

I personally have not been involved in the majority of the due diligence process that has been conducted to date.  I had one brief meeting with Solomon Smith Barney, but did not provide them with any documents.  I have had two meetings with various team members with JPMorgan Chase, and again have not given them documents.  

Even though the only documents provided to date by the operations team have been risk related reports, we are compiling other information that supports discussions that the operations team has had with due diligence teams.  The compilation of that data should be completed today.

It could very well take up to 5 months for people to get a check in their hands?  That is not right.

868,"Before I draft a response, I wanted to clarify that Section 3.0 of Schedule ""C"" to the Contracting Party Agreement governing NGX provides for the determination of unsecured credit availability, which is essentially a collateral threshold, for investment grade counterparties or counterparties that have provided an investment grade guarantee, which can be determined in the sole discretion of NGX, but with a maximum for BBB credits of Cdn. $30 million (the previous maximum for BBB+ credits was Cdn. $35 million).  

Accordingly, it is arguable that NGX can apply whatever unsecured credit threshold it chooses, however, arguably, it must do so acting in a commercially reasonable manner and having regard to its equitable treatment of similar graded credits.  Accordingly, I will draft a response on this basis, imposing an obligation on NGX to treat us reasonably and equitably, but in the meantime, I believe that we should be taking steps to satisfy NGX's credit requirements both by providing the margin they require and by having the traders minimize their position to the extent possible.

I will forward a draft response shortly.

taken into income.  I told Juanita and Andrea that it would be ridiculously

Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

As indicated in the DASH, the $44.6MM represents the total amount requested for expenditures on project soft costs, as defined by accounting.  None of these dollars may be expended for hard costs, as defined by accounting, thereby preserving the ability to finance the power plant off balance sheet.  Any additional project expenditures (including commitments) which may be requested through another DASH (for turbine payments as mentioned in this DASH or any new amounts) must be incurred by a financing vehicle/structure which will allow this power project to be financed off Enron's balance sheet.

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disg=
usted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrenc=
e.=20

I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC=
.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with=
 the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way a=
nd learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a=
 believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nose=
d, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and hel=
d on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometim=
es daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top execu=
tives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of r=
easons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compens=
ated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlement=
s, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in th=
e Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew so=
mething we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us=
 that Enron was going to be the ""World's Leading Company.""  He even put the=
 goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in Februa=
ry how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the c=
ynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was h=
opeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that =
high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e.,=
 +/- 20%. =20

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more option=
s.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afr=
aid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have ma=
ny working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my sa=
vings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their=
 entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking =
forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let m=
e remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less t=
han a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Ot=
her employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for t=
heir children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and=
 the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the =
industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeleton=
s in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees=
 and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumb=

I am writing to confirm our discussion of yesterday afternoon.  After we
spoke, I conferred with John Watson who, like me, believed that we were
going to use terms of the Enron Field financing for the Arena, with a few
minor changes that we had discussed.  The term sheet that we originally
provided you during the summer reflected that arrangement.  We have
discussed that term sheet with the partners, believing it to be the deal,
and they have approved the garage loan on those terms.

John and I believe that the comments on the term sheet that you, James
Hernandez and Mike Bartolotta have provided us recently constitute a
significant departure from the Enron Field deal.  Although we understand the
arguments each of you have made in favor of such comments, these comments
nonetheless will need to be evaluated by a business representative from the
partnership and approved by the partnership.  I recommend that we schedule a
meeting next week so that we can discuss these issues and try to resolve
them.

Finally, John was disappointed to hear that the HCHSA will be unwilling to
prepay the $1.4 million amount needed by the referendum.  Because we
understand that the referendum campaign is in dire need of funding, we hope
that you might reconsider your decision not to prepay the $1.4 million until
after we have finalized the term sheet.

I will be unavailable for a great deal of the day today, but I will have
time to meet next week.  Please let me know when we might be able to get
together to discuss the term sheet.

see that a part of our 70's folklore still lives today.  

Vance - never in a million years would I have guessed you'd end up in 
Switzerland! I'd be happy to take you up on the offer for a visit. I'll send 
you my address so you know where to send the plane tickets :-) 

I can't pass up this opportunity to share my all-time favorite SB Bove award. 
It involved a brother who, having led a pampered life at home, had never done 
his own laundry. He decided the time had come to do his own laundry. Sometime 
later, after having deposited the proper coinage and starting the machine, he 
returned to check on his laundry. He was found standing at the DRYER 
bewildered as to why his powdered laundry detergent had not dissolved and his 
clothes were still dry. 

I know who it was. Let's see how many of you guys remember! And if anyone 
remembers the details better, I'd love to hear the rest of it!

find any current information to verify the existence or final resolution of 
account balances for the subject contracts.  A review of our billing records 
reflects that the contracts have not been invoiced since December 1998.  The 
net loss of revenue will be negligible compared to the ill will that would be 
generated in attempting to bill these all-but-forgotten, year and a half old 
P&R quantities. 

The monthly invoicing file now tracks P&R quantities carried over from month 
to month. This practice should prevent this problem from occurring in the 
future.  

Note: There are currently two shippers with P&R balances that have carried 
over from previous months. - Reliant PO# 27060 has 1,514 MMBtu parked at POI#

912,"El Paso South System Flows 700 MMcf/d

Less than two weeks after the deadly explosion on El Paso Natural Gas' system 
in southeastern New Mexico, the pipeline last week had more than 700 MMcf/d 
of its 1.1 Bcf/d capacity restored to its South Mainline that services 
markets between Texas and California. 

At mid-day Friday, El Paso said it began running about 260 MMcf/d through 
Line 1100 after it received the go-ahead from the federal Office of Pipeline 
Safety (OPS), according to spokeswoman Kim Wallace. El Paso was able to 
re-start partial service on the 26-inch line after it built a 16-inch 
temporary connector line between Line 1110 and Line 1100, which was approved 
by OPS. 

The temporary connector was installed just east of the Pecos River explosion 
site, about 30 miles from Carlsbad, NM. Wallace said Line 1100 would carry 
the gas from Eunice, NM, just Northeast of the Pecos River Compressor 
Station, to the connector with Line 1110, which then would transport it 
westward across the Pecos River Bridge where it would meet up with Line 1100 
further downstream. Meanwhile, Wallace said El Paso submitted to OPS last 
week the test results and a preliminary return-to-service plan for Line 1100. 

Three days prior, the OPS had given El Paso permission to restore service to 
Line 1110 from the Keystone Station through the Pecos River Compressor 
Station at a reduced level. The pipeline re-opened the line at about 400 
MMcf/d, and gradually increased it to 480 MMcf/d by Friday. This is ""still 
within the limits it [OPS] set"" for Line 1110, Wallace said. 

The OPS restricted El Paso's Line 1110 to 80% of the operating pressure of 
Line 1103 at the time it ruptured, according to Department of Transportation 
spokeswoman Debbie Hinz. She said this put the line at a pressure of about 
538 pounds per square inch. 

The OPS-ordered shutdown of Line 1110 lasted 10 days, during which the agency 
ordered El Paso to conduct extensive hydrostatic, ultrasound and X-ray tests 
to determine its safety, and to submit a plan for restoring service to the 
line. 

As for the future of ruptured Line 1103, Wallace said repairs on it would not 
begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed, which will 
""probably be nine to 12 months."" 

The restoration of service couldn't come soon enough for El Paso customers 
who have been scrambling for transportation capacity ever since federal 
investigators and regulators closed down the three lines that make up El 
Paso's South Main leg in the wake of the blast that killed 11 people and 
critically injured one. California customers have been taking gas out of 
storage to meet their needs during the service interruption. The Department 
of Energy has set up a task force to evaluate the effects of the explosion 
and shutdown on the gas market.

By now you have probably heard all about implementation of SAP Timekeeping 
and eHR Online.  Well it is almost upon us.  Some of the business units in 
GPG will implement self-service time entry but ET&S along with other business 
units will not implement self-service it at this time.  Your timekeeper will 
still be responsible for entering your payroll information i.e. vacation, 
sick.  Because of the upcoming July 3-4 holiday and more importantly the new 
SAP timekeeping system your timesheets should be submitted to your timekeeper 
as soon after June 23 as possible.  This will be the first time entry period 
via SAP and we want to insure that everything is entered correctly.  The new 
system is not as user friendly as the current system thus requiring more time 
to complete payrolls.  If you have changes to your timesheet after you have 
submitted it give a corrected copy to your timekeeper and the necessary 
adjustments will be made the following pay period.",,,SAP Timekeeping Team eHR Online GPG ET&S SAP

*********************************************************

Rather than enjoying a respite, western energy markets will make November
a catch-up month. Natural gas demand will remain high when compared with
the same period last year, as gas-fired generation will continue to run at 
high
utilization rates and market participants try to restore gas storage to normal
levels. The tight supply situation will maintain upward pressure on gas
prices, which will range from $5.15 to $5.83 per million British thermal
units, depending on location. Refueling outages at three nuclear units, along
with a seasonal decline in hydroelectric output, will maintain gas-fired
generation on the margin for most of November. On-peak power prices will
remain higher as a result, in the $86-$98 per megawatt-hour range,
depending on location.

934,"PG&E to Expand Pacific Northwest System

Responding to tight energy supplies in the Pacific Northwest and California, 
PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group revealed plans Wednesday to begin an open 
season early next year, kicking off a five-year expansion effort. The first 
phase would add 200 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity out of western 
Canada on its Gas Transmission-Northwest (GTN) pipeline system. The PG&E GTN 
group expects the phase one expansion to be in service by November 2002 at 
the latest. 

""As we have been anticipating, the western natural gas market is at a 
critical point in the need for additional pipeline capacity,"" said Thomas B. 
King, president of the PG&E National Energy Group (PG&E NEG) West Region. 
""Gas supplies into the Pacific Northwest and California are very tight. At 
the same time, the market is strong and growing, and the PG&E Gas 
Transmission Northwest pipeline system has been operating at or near maximum 
capacity levels for the greater part of the year. We believe GTN is now 
positioned for an aggressive expansion period that will result in additional

935,"El Paso Proceeding with NM Pipe Integrity Testing

El Paso Natural Gas has received approval from the U.S. Department of 
Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) to conduct more internal 
inspections on its rebuilt New Mexico pipeline, which ruptured August 19 
killing 11 people (see Daily GPI, Aug. 22). Since the explosion, flows 
through the line, which runs from West Texas to California, have been reduced 
to 85% capacity, or about 920 MMcf/d. 

OPS said the El Paso line has already been repaired and put through 
hydrostatic testing, which it passed. Hydrostatic testing checks for cracks 
by forcing high-pressure water through the line. Now El Paso has the green 
light to begin smart pig testing, which will examine the internal integrity 
of the line. The device, called a pig because of the sound it makes during 
inspections, has sensors and once placed inside the line, it can detect 
dents, deformities and changes in wall thickness. 

Neither OPS nor El Paso released a timetable as to when the pigging would 
occur or how long it would take. However, once the testing is completed, the 
results will be evaluated by OPS, which then would determine if the line were 
safe for commercial use. 

OPS has not issued actual regulations on smart pig use, but they have become 
increasingly sophisticated and more widely used. Even though hydrostatic 
testing can actually detect certain flaws that are invisible to smart pigs, 
the pigging process is considered a complement to the water testing and 
ensures more integrity in test results. 

OPS requires all pipe to undergo at least one hydrostatic test after 
construction. Although not mandated, OPS also has proposed requiring 
pipelines that transport liquid petroleum products to use direct assessment 
methods such as pigging to evaluate the pipeline's integrity. Other types of 
inspections include using magnetic particles or ultrasound to measure the 
pipe wall's thickness.

936,"InterGen Takes 30% Stake in Coral Energy

With plans to grow its power generation portfolio in the United States, 
InterGen, the power generation 
joint venture of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Bechtel Enterprise Holdings 
Inc., closed a deal yesterday 
giving the international developer a 30% equity interest in Houston-based 
Coral Energy, one of the 
largest natural gas and power marketers in the country. 

Coral Energy officials had predicted in July that Shell and construction 
giant Bechtel would fold InterGen, 
InterGen North America and certain assets of Coral Energy into one business 
(see Daily GPI, July 10). 
Under the agreement announced yesterday, InterGen will receive the majority 
of the natural gas pipeline, 
storage and power generation assets of Shell's Coral Energy affiliate in the 
United States. It remains a 
joint venture of Shell and Bechtel. 

The move gives Shell a 68% ownership in InterGen, with Bechtel owning the 
remaining 32%. InterGen 
had been formed as a 50/50 joint venture, and Bechtel made an undisclosed 
payment to Shell in the 
deal. About 230 Coral employees, mostly related to the Texas-based assets in 
Houston, will become 
InterGen employees under the agreement. 

InterGen is considered a world leader in power generation development, with 
projects around the world. 
Carlos Riva, InterGen's CEO, said that the transaction ""represents a 
significant boost to our plans in the 
United States. These assets and strengthened alignment with a premier U.S. 
gas and electricity trading 
enterprise will provide InterGen a strong platform for growth in the U.S. 
market."" 

Globally, the alignment is expected to help leverage Shell's strengths in 
both fuel supply and power 
marketing and trading. Bechtel will continue to be InterGen's preferred 
provider for worldwide power 
generation engineering, procurement and construction services. Coral is the 
region's third largest natural 
gas marketer and the twentieth largest power marketer in the country. 

Linda Cook, Shell Gas and Power's CEO, said the ""whole idea"" was to help 
InterGen grow in the United 
States, and that the best way was to add Shell assets to it. ""Success in 
tomorrow's energy markets will 
be earned through globally aligned marketing, trading and asset companies,"" 
said Cook. ""That's 
critically true in the U.S. and will be the case as competitive energy 
markets open worldwide. InterGen 
plans to build a sizable power generation portfolio in the U.S., working 
closely with Coral to pursue 
investment decisions that make the most commercial sense. We expect this 
relationship to make a 
significant contribution to both InterGen's and Coral's long-term success."" 

Shell and Bechtel formed InterGen in March 1999 (see Daily GPI, March 18, 
1999) specifically to pursue 
power generation opportunities in North America. The Boston-based company was 
set up to develop, 

""Shell, Bechtel and InterGen have among them the complete skill set for 
success in the new global energy 
market,"" said Paul Unruh, COO of Bechtel. ""InterGen is a world-class 
developer with a proven track record 
of successfully developing, financing and operating projects around the 
world. Shell is one of the most 
successful marketers and traders of energy in the U.S. and is expanding into 
deregulating natural gas 
and power markets globally; Bechtel is a global leader in the development, 
engineering and construction 
of power facilities. These strengths together create a large power generation 
platform now directly linked 
with global energy marketing and trading."" 

InterGen's portfolio will give Coral Energy access for its trading business, 
and Coral will participate as part 
of Shell's global trading network, with InterGen a business partner in its 
expanding North American asset 
platform. As the exclusive marketer of Shell's gas production, Coral has a 
gas supply of 2.5 Bcf/d, and a 
trading platform dealing in extensive volumes of energy in all key supply 
basins. For Bechtel, the agreement 
will help it lock in construction contracts for its combined cycle gas 
turbine power stations. 

Specifically, the assets to be transferred to InterGen from Coral include the 
following: 

4,000 miles of major intrastate gas pipelines in Texas. The pipeline 
facilities extend from South Texas near the 
Mexican border along the Texas Gulf Coast to the Louisiana boarder, and north 
from near Houston to the East 
Texas producing areas. 
The West Clear Lake Storage facility, one of the largest natural gas storage 
reservoirs in Texas. Located near 
the Houston Ship Channel, it has a leasehold interest in the Stratton Ridge 
storage facility.

938,"American Electric Power Buys Houston Pipe Line

American Electric Power Thursday announced it has made a major move to expand 
its wholesale natural gas business in the Southwest, agreeing to acquire the 
2.4 Bcf/d Houston Pipe Line (HPL) along with the Bammel storage field, one of 
the largest storage fields in North America, from Enron. AEP said since some 
details remain to be worked out, it was not disclosing the terms of the 
transaction at this time. AEP will be acquiring the stock of HPL and it 
expects to complete the deal in the next couple months. 

HPL, one of the two original pipelines joined by Enron Chairman Ken Lay to 
form the company in the mid-1980s, has an extensive 4,400 mile transportation 
and gathering system through southern Texas. The 118 Bcf Bammel field, 
located near the Houston Ship Channel market area, has a 65.7 Bcf working gas 
capacity and is known for its fast in and out capabilities. It has a 1.4 
Bcf/d peak withdrawal rate and a 365 MMcf/d injection capacity. 

""Adding HPL to our natural gas asset portfolio will help us reach our goal of 
becoming a top-10 gas trader and marketer,"" said Paul Addis, executive vice 
president for AEP. The company currently is second in the U.S. in electricity 
volume. ""HPL will enhance AEP's natural gas business with its multiple 
connections into the production areas of Texas, its numerous interconnects 
with intrastate and interstate pipelines and its position in and around 
Houston as a premier provider of natural gas."" 

AEP, headquartered in Columbus, OH, has numerous power generation plants in 
the Midwest and Southwest, including a number of gas-fired plants in Texas. 
In 1998 it bought the Louisiana Intrastate Gas (LIG) system. 

John Olson, energy analyst with Sanders, Morris & Mundy in Houston, said ""for 
55 years HPL has enjoyed a reputation as one of the strongest pipelines in 
the country. As a stand-alone operation it is first class. It's a very, very 
strong asset."" He said HPL has been showing losses of $50 million a year or 
more in recent years, ""but those numbers are meaningless"" because Enron has 
been using it at discounted transportation rates to underpin its marketing 
efforts. Olson said the sale is a continuation of Enron's move to sell most 
of its hard assets and become a soft asset player. ""They are emphasizing 
their trading. They are doing far better at trading."" 

For one Houston-based risk manager, the sale of HPL by Enron was a question 
of rate of return. The competition among intrastates in Texas is fiercely 
competitive and for gas delivered to the Houston Ship Channel it can be a 
game of half-cents, with a shipper on one of the multiple intrastates 
undercutting another to try to shave a profit, he said. Enron recognized this 
and wanted out, he speculated.

939,"CMS, DEFS Swap Strategic Properties

In a strategic move said to benefit both midstream energy companies, CMS 
Field Services Inc. has swapped some of its natural gas assets in Oklahoma 
and Kansas for some of Duke Energy Field Services' similar assets onshore and 
offshore Louisiana. 

DEFS' natural gas gathering and condensate measuring and transportation 
assets onshore and offshore Louisiana were exchanged with CMS Field Services' 
assets in Oklahoma and Kansas, giving each company more proximity to their 
other assets. The deal closed Dec. 20 and was announced Friday. No financial 
details were disclosed. 

""This transaction makes both strategic and economic sense for CMS Energy,"" 
said Tim Young, senior vice president of the field services division. In 
1999, CMS Energy acquired Duke Energy's Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. and 
Trunkline Gas Co., and Young said the swap gives CMS more opportunities to 
offer enhanced services to ""existing and potential shippers"" on CMS-owned 
properties along the Gulf Coast. 

In the deal, CMS obtained 10 offshore gas gathering laterals, a one-third 
ownership in the Atchafalaya Pipeline System and complete ownership in a 
Patterson, LA condensate measuring facility. The 10 offshore gas gathering 
laterals are connected to two offshore pipelines owned by CMS Energy: the 
Trunkline Gas Co.'s Terrebonne system and the Sea Robin Pipeline Co. The 
39-mile-long Atchafalaya Pipeline receives condensate from the Terrebonne 
system, while the Patterson measurement facility measures condensate 
transported through the Atchafalaya pipe. 

In return, Denver-based DEFS, a subsidiary of Duke Energy and Phillips 
Petroleum, obtained two Midcontinent natural gas gathering systems: the 
Bradshaw system in Kansas and the Roaring Creek system in Oklahoma. DEFS also 
will pick up the Miles Hampton and Ulysses systems in Kansas and the 
Christmas Lateral in South Texas. 

""These assets are a great strategic fit with our assets in the area, as they 
will specifically supply to plants with existing capacity,"" said Michael 
Bradley, senior vice president, DEFS' northern division. Bradley said the 
asset exchange supported the company's growth strategy ""optimizing and 
rationalizing assets"" and giving the company more flexibility. 

CMS Field Services supplies regions of Louisiana, the Texas Gulf Coast, West 
Texas, Central Texas, the Midcontinent and the Rocky Mountains, and owns 
approximately 5,000 miles of gathering pipeline. DEFS, 70% owned by Duke and 
30% by Phillips, operates in 11 states and across five of the largest natural 
gas producing regions in North America. It owns and operates 71 plants and 
57,000 miles of pipe, with operating territory extending from western Canada 
to the Gulf Coast.

Strong business mix pushes energy firm past estimates 

MONDAY, JANUARY 22, 2001 11:19:00 AM EST 
By Andrew Kelly
HOUSTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, on Monday reported a sharp rise in 
fourth-quarter operating earnings, surpassing expectations, as online trading 
drove strong growth at its core wholesale energy operations.
Enron said it took a net non-recurring after-tax charge of $287 million in 
the fourth quarter related to its troubled water affiliate Azurix Corp. AZX 
</quotes/quotes.asp?symb=AZX&source=>. Enron announced plans last year to 
finance a buyout that would take Azurix private.
Earnings before non-recurring items rose 34 percent, to $347 million, or 41 
cents a share, from $259 million or 31 cents a share a year earlier.
Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 35 cents a share, according to 
First Call/Thomson Financial.
In early Monday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron's shares were 
up $3-1/8, or 4.41 percent, at $74.
Fourth-quarter net income including the Azurix charge was $60 million, or 5 
cents per share.
The company's fourth-quarter revenues rose 271 percent from a year earlier, 
to $40.8 billion.
""The impressive thing is the overall growth that they experienced,"" said 
Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. ""I think it had been in most people's 
forecasts that they would have to do something to clean up Azurix.""
ANALYST MAINTAINS BUY RATING
Eassey said he was retaining a ""buy"" rating on Enron's stock and considered 
the company one of his top picks.
""I think that they will sustain a higher growth rate on average for the next 
several years going forward, as they have for the past 10 years, because of 
their innovation and their way of attacking the markets,"" he said.
Analysts pointed to the strong volume growth in Enron's core energy business 
and played down the significance of the charge for Azurix.
Enron, which has branched out beyond energy into fields such as broadband 
telecommunications and metals trading, saw its stock rise 87 percent in 2000, 
outpacing a 54 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's utilities index  
</quotes/quotes.asp?symb=&source=>.
Electricity and natural gas stocks were boosted by safe-haven buying in 2000 
as investors lost faith in other sectors.
So far this year, Enron's stock is down 12 percent, broadly in line with the 
S&P utilities index, which has fallen as investors have cashed in some of 
last year's gains. Concern about possible fallout from California's power 
crisis has also hurt the index.
Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling said in a 
conference call that the company's fourth-quarter earnings were not 
significantly impacted by the power crisis in California, where rolling 
electricity blackouts were imposed last week and the state's top two 
utilities are close to bankruptcy as they face soaring wholesale electricity 
costs.
""We do not expect the California situation to have any significant effect on 
Enron's financial outlook, specifically our ability to hit 2001 targets,"" he 
added.
Meanwhile, Enron said its physical wholesale gas and power deliveries rose 90 
percent in the fourth quarter from year-earlier levels, with strong growth 
both in North America and Europe.
EnronOnline, the company's Web-based trading system, completed its first full 
year of operation in 2000, executing 548,000 transactions with a gross value 
of $336 billion.
Besides gas and power, Enron uses the online system to make markets in 
commodities such as pulp and paper, petrochemicals, metals and broadband 
capacity, also known as bandwidth.
ORIGINS AS PIPELINE COMPANY
Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron has pursued opportunities 
created by deregulation to become North America's biggest wholesale gas and 
electricity marketer. It is building a similar business in Europe, where 
energy markets are also gradually opening up to competition.
Enron regards its knowledge of volatile energy and commodity markets as its 
key strength, allowing it to profit from price swings while saving money for 
its customers and managing their exposure to potentially costly movements in 
prices.
Fourth-quarter earnings before interest and taxes at Enron's wholesale energy 
business almost tripled from a year earlier, to $777 million.
Enron Energy Services, which helps business customers reduce their energy 
costs, posted earnings before interest and taxes of $33 million, up from $7 
million in the fourth quarter of 1999.
On Friday Enron Energy Services said it had signed an energy management 
agreement with Owens-Illinois Inc. OI </quotes/quotes.asp?symb=OI&source=> 
worth $2 billion over 10 years, its biggest deal to date.
Enron said its broadband telecommunications business, which was launched last 
year and is still in the start-up phase, posted a loss of $32 million on 
revenues of $63 million for the fourth quarter. Enron has said it will take a 
few years for the business to become profitable.
The company sells bandwidth on its own fiber optic network and is also 
pioneering the development of standardized tradable bandwidth contracts.",Andrew Kelly Azurix Donato Eassey Jeff Skilling,"$287 million $347 million 41

NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead 
The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week.
For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. 
NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience. 
""We don't expect a repeat of the record-breaking cold temperatures of November-December of last year, but this winter should be cooler than the warm winters of the late 1990s,"" said Scott Gudes, NOAA's acting administrator. ""Citizens should prepare for the full range of winter weather."" 
Climate factors that influenced last winter will play a similar role this season. They include the Arctic Oscillation, which influences the number of cold-air outbreaks in the South and Nor'easters on the East Coast, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can impact the number of heavy rain storms in the Pacific Northwest. 
""This winter, NOAA's improving technologies will help National Weather Service forecasters -- for the first time -- pinpoint when these factors will kick in and bring extreme weather,"" said Jack Kelly, director of NOAA's National Weather Service. 
Colder-than-normal temperatures are expected in the Northeast. Snowfall for the entire region will depend on the fluctuations of the Arctic Oscillation. The Mid-Atlantic states have equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal temperatures and precipitation. Storm tracks could bring more snow than the winters of the late 1990s, but this largely depends on the Arctic Oscillation, NOAA said. The Southeast should be drier than normal. Temperatures have an equal chance of averaging above normal, normal or below normal. 
In the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, temperatures should be lower than normal, with more sub-zero days than the average of recent winters. There are equal chances for cumulative precipitation to be above normal, normal, or below normal. The northern Great Plains and Rockies should see below-normal temperatures with more sub-zero days than experienced on average during the winters of the late 1990s, but wet and mild weather is more likely for the southern Plains. 
The central Rockies can expect equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal precipitation and temperatures. In the Northwest, there are equal chances for above normal, normal, or below-normal rain and snow. Heavy coastal rain events are more likely compared to the previous three winters. A repeat of the near-record dryness seen last winter is unlikely. NOAA said to expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in most of the Southwest (except western California) and equal chances of above normal, normal or below-normal precipitation.

California's second merchant underground natural gas storage project near Sacramento began injecting supplies this month, but its commercial start-up date has been pushed back to Dec. 1, according to the California operations manager for Houston-based Western Hub Properties LLC, the developer. 
Although it is not fully subscribed more than half the capacity is under contract, according to Jim Fossum, the in-state manager for Western Hub, which was purchased last summer by a partnership of Aquila Inc and ArcLight Energy Partners Fund in a $220 million deal that is still several months away from approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. 
The Lodi Storage Project near the town of Lodi, CA, about 35 miles south of the state capital, will have ""high-performance, quick-cycle-capabilities"" in a project that stores 12 Bcf of natural gas with a 500 MMcf/d withdrawal rate and 400 MMcf/d injection rate. 
Fossum said Western Hub also is pursuing a second merchant storage project in the southern half of the state around Bakersfield in the Wheeler Ridge area close to the nexus of all the major interstate natural gas pipeline coming into California. That project, he said, is not included in the Aquila partnership purchase at this time, and will be developed initial by a still-to-be-named company using some of the same personnel that developed Lodi.

*********************************************************

Rather than enjoying a respite, western energy markets will make November
a catch-up month. Natural gas demand will remain high when compared with
the same period last year, as gas-fired generation will continue to run at 
high
utilization rates and market participants try to restore gas storage to normal
levels. The tight supply situation will maintain upward pressure on gas
prices, which will range from $5.15 to $5.83 per million British thermal
units, depending on location. Refueling outages at three nuclear units, along
with a seasonal decline in hydroelectric output, will maintain gas-fired
generation on the margin for most of November. On-peak power prices will
remain higher as a result, in the $86-$98 per megawatt-hour range,
depending on location.

967,"Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Then, at an afternoon meeting of employees in the company's core natural gas and electricity trading operation, which provides by far the biggest part of Enron's profits, ''quite a bit of concern was raised about the news people had been seeing about this change-of-control payment,'' Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said. 
At about 4 p.m. Central time, two senior executives who had attended the meeting, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen, told Mr. Lay about the reaction of employees. ''Ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether,'' Mr. Palmer said. Even if Dynegy's directors later voted to award Mr. Lay a new severance agreement, he would turn it down, Mr. Palmer added.

that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work

your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.

1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 25, 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
 
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.  
 
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.

to implement this new service. We need to start meeting with 
marketing/legal/regulatory to determine how we will implement this & define 
the system requirements. Here are some of my questions:

If we recall & the nomination is still in place, then how do we allocate? 
What are the allocation rules?
How do we track the volumes/contracts that have been recalled? Who will 
monitor this process? What type of process is needed to track recalls & 
transporter call volumes?
What is the timing for the recall notice? Can it occur after the gas day has 
started? Will we have partial day recalls?
Will the recall option & transporter put option carry over to the aquiring 
shipper? What system changes are needed for capacity release?
How do we require a shipper to take firm transport capacity? Will this have 
some type of OFO notice similar to EFBH that requires the shipper to nominate?
How will the invoice system be changed to handle the various option fee 
processes? Will we store this information at a contract level in CBS or in 
the rate system at a contract level? Who will load & monitor these fee 
options?
Do we need a new Rate Schedule?

Lindy, can you let me know when you are availble to start meeting on this new 
service so that I can create our system requirements document. I am availble 
July 24th, 25th, & 26th.

Capacity Marketing - Conoco was awarded the 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity from San Juan to Needles at max rates for five years and one month beginning 3/1/02.  Demand charges for the term total $14mm.  

Despite the ongoing system maintenance that began this week, gas control has steadily been able to increase TW's west flow from the projected 800,000 MMBtu/d to 900,000 by week's end.  We have also been able to schedule IT deliveries at max rates from Topock to Needles.  This slight increase will help us make up for the greater decrease in volume due to DOT mandated reduced operating pressures when the safety dig-outs commence in early May.  For the period May 8-12, our projected flow of 800,000 MMBtu/d to the border will be reduced to 705,000.

Atoka Lateral Test - We have been working with Agave Petroleum to reconfigure some gas flow as it moves through the Atoka 3 station on the lateral.  Agave is moving approximately 15,000 MMBtu/d of its high pressure gas onto the LEC 10"" lateral from the Atoka low pressure line.  The TW Artesia Team moved one A3 compressor from Atoka to the LEC line.  The first test day was Thursday 4/5; the test will run for one week.  If the test works to everyone's satisfaction, we will need to install an additional H2s monitor at A3.  The net benefit to TW of the test will likely be minimal but may allow Agave to better utilize its compression and plant resources around the Atoka system.

ONEOK Westar - We have been working with ONEOK to enable them to make the existing Ward County, TX delivery point a high-volume bi-directional point.  They have installed approximately 1500' of pipe from their Red River system over to the south end (below WT-2) of TW's West Texas lateral.  The ultrasonic meter will be capable of flowing 200,000 MMBtu/d into TW's high pressure line.  ONEOK expects to flow on average 80,000 MMBtu/d.  This volume, by displacement, should free up some WT-2 and WT-1 compressor capacity for gas flowing to Texas intrastate lines; in-service date is expected to be June 1, 2001.",Needles ONEOK Westar -,$14mm,MMBtu/d TW Needles DOT Atoka Lateral Test Agave Petroleum Artesia Team LEC H2s Agave ONEOK

Please forward me a revised copy of this spreadsheet once you have completed 
the relevant information.  I welcome your input on the information contained 
within this schedule.

Our goal here is to create a schedule which is factually correct (based on 
all of the relevant agreements) and does not create any 
inconsistencies/conflicts with the TurboPark documents.  We need to deliver a 
draft of this schedule to the TurboPark banks tomorrow  for their review.  
This schedule represents one of four documents required to effect a smooth 
transfer of the relevant equipment interests from TurboPark into the 
respective CA Development entity and close this transaction prior to the 
1/15/01 deadline.

Call me to discuss any of this information.

Attached is the revised draft for your review.  Among other things, it 
further moves the contract from international to domestic and addresses the 
fully reimbursable basis and the differing responsibilities regarding 
existing equipment.  I still have a few concerns regarding:

1. The equipment procurement mechanism, currently as agent for Owner.
2. The payment mechanism.  There is currently no down payment.

I got a call from Bob Sevitz regarding a change I made to the EECC revisions 
to the Co Op City EPC contract.  Specifically, I deleted language he had 
added to the waiver of consequential damages.  Bob had added a provision that 
said that the waiver was ""subject to"" the indemnification section of the 
contract.  I felt this was too broad of a carve out, especially from the 
contractor's point of view.   Any tweaking of the indemnity language (to 
blatantly reconcile it with the waiver) can occur during the drafting process.

Just wanted to pass this along.

We won't have any site specific technical info, so we will  have to fly 
without it.  I know that seems strange, but there is no designated site for 
this equipment as of now.

Here's co#1:



Each of these units has one dual fuel option.

The master list of serial numbers is in this document:




We use the unit serial numbers as opposed to turbine or generator serial 
numbers.  I'm sending you the whole enchilada since this is a handy reference.

I agree with adding 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option to the January 
payment.  Unit 17  to company 1 is fine.  The maximum liability price (or 
whatever we call it) will be the base price allocation, plus the dual fuel 
option amount.

Good question on the retention.  I guess we should set it up as if each is in 
a stand alone project. As far as I know they may be intending to put these at 
separate sites.

I'll get back to you on the fax and contract reference number.

Here is a quick update and a request for your assistance:

On Wednesday, November 22, ENA sent West LB a 5-day notice indicating our 
intent to exercise the purchase option by Friday.
On Friday, November 30, ENA will execute the purchase option and at that time 
own the 4 turbines for the Austin project.
Hopefully, by the end of the week, ENA and GE will execute the breakout 
agreement which will ensure, primarily, that the GE warranties attached to 
the 4 Austin turbines are completely conveyed to ENA.

Attached is the latest draft of the GE Breakout agreement between ENA and GE. 
 In order to complete the breakout agreement, the lawyers need you guys to 
review section 10 regarding site specific performance guarantees and provide 
comments.  Also, please let us (Kay Mann and myself) know what Exhibit F and 
U should contain.  The GE lawyers indicated they would provide the first 
draft soon.

Let us know you thoughts as soon as possible.

1064,"Kay and Carlos:

Greg Lang advises that they are targeting a financial closing with their
lenders on Thursday, April 19.  If this bears out, the escrow would be
funded three business days later, on Tuesday, April 24.  However, ENA can
terminate the letter agreement if the escrow is not funded on or before
Friday, April 20.  Therefore, PPL may (although I have not confirmed their
intent in this regard) fund the escrow immediately following their financial
closing, rather than waiting the three business days.  They are proceeding
under the assumption that an acceleration of payments to GE will be
negotiated.  If not, Plan B (the ""non-disturbance"" lien) requires additional
documentation with their lenders and with ENA that may result in some delay.
Resolution of this issue is obviously critical to the timetable.  Let me
know if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks.

I am responding to your message on behalf of Mike McConnell.  Mike is in 
Singapore at this time and we are not sure if he will be successful in 
dialing up to catch up on his e-mail correspondence.  

Thank you very much for your message.  We solicit one time lump-sum 
contributions to JDF rather than per mile.  In addition, we collect the 
pledges for the walk - rain or shine.  The reason of course is that our main 
goal is to raise money to find a cure and we would prefer that weather or 
other elements beyond our control not impact our ability to raise funds.  
However, we have a great time on walk day and we have a lot of people turn 
out for the walk.  This year we are anticipating in excess of 500 walkers.  
The total amount of donations that are turned in by Enron employees are very 
generously matched dollar-for-dollar by the Enron Foundation.  Therefore, the 
matching forms are not necessary.  

If you happen to be in Houston on November 5th we would enjoy having you join 
us for the walk.  If you care to make a donation, it may be mailed to Mike at 
the following address:

 Mike McConnell
 Enron Global Markets
 1400 Smith Street, EB 3328
 Houston, TX  77002

If you donate $25 or more you are entitled to an Enron/JDF Walk T-shirt.  If 
you are interested just send us your size (M-L-XL-XXL) and location and we 
will get one to you.

Hello from Houston.  I really enjoyed meeting with you last Saturday at your 
gallery.  Your collection of work is very impressive.

I have not received your digital pictures that you were putting together but 
I did talk with my wife about the Bonnard.  The Bonnard is my first choice of 
all the pieces we discussed.  I found an illustration of it on the net (from 
another gallery) and she liked (although - not as much as me).  I am prepared 
to purchase a Bonnard and the Radiator is my first choice.  I would like to 
establish a relationship and do business with your gallery and would like to 
know what is your best price for the piece.  I will not shop the price around 
and will make a quick decision with a credit card number.   When I get your 
response and if it is competitive, I'll confirm the purchase when I pick up 
the email.

Thanks,
Mike McConnell

PS - I will hold off on the others for now and when you send me the pictures 
I will show them to my wife for consideration.  I am considering the Mary

firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, 
their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the 
project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to 
those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in 
the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it 
seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by 
asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices 
and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by 
surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our 
participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network 
Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 
minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will 
be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific 
practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If 
you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those 
of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the

Good to see you in New York last week at the Guggenheim -- I enjoyed your 
company at the dinner.  Lisa Yoho passed on your questions about the Bush 
Energy Plan and opportunities for EGM, so I thought I'd outline a few from 
Lisa Jacobson's and my perspective.  Many of the recommendations in the 
Energy Plan are very broad and could take months (if not years) to approve.  
However, there are certainly a few areas where EGM could find more immediate 
opportunity, or where we could weigh in to make the longer-term components of 
the plan beneficial to Enron.
 
Short-term opportunities

$2 billion over ten years for Clean Coal Technologies:  There may be 
opportunities to pursue R&D funding, pilot projects, or tax incentives for 
technologies such as NOx Tech.  While the bulk of this money could take 
several years to approve, there is ""clean coal"" program money available now 
for FY 2002, and DOE is already structuring programs for 2003 money.   I have 
already discussed this briefly with the Clean Energy Solutions folks, but we 
have good contacts at DOE and they are very anxious to work with Enron, as 
they see us as a company who can help make the most of their R&D money 
because we are serious about moving technologies to market.   

Climate Change R&D:  Any financial support the government puts toward climate 
change R&D could likely also be utilized for new generation/control 
technologies, but this would be a longer-term opportunity.

New Source Review (NSR) Reforms -  NSR has been an obstacle to constructing 
new generation, but also a huge thorn in the side of big coal-using utilities 
who would like to make modifications to keep grandfathered plants alive as 
long as possible.  The Clinton/Browner EPA brought major enforcement lawsuits 
against a number (Southern, TVA, AEP, Cinergy) and a few have settled 
(Cinergy, TECO). The Bush Energy Plan asks the EPA and Justice Dept. to look 
at 1) possible changes to the NSR enforcement lawsuits and 2) longer term 
changes to NSR regulation -- all in the name of bringing more energy supply 
on line.  The utilities are mounting very aggressive lobbying efforts to 
change NSR.

A DOJ decision on the enforcement could be forthcoming in the short term 
(summer 2001).  In the big picture for Enron, letting the big, coal-using 
utilities off the hook would not be the best outcome -- enforcement relief 
only holds benefits for the incumbents and not new entrants in the power 
development market.   But if it happens, we'll make sure the EGM folks have 
good advance warning so that they can take advantage of any coal trading or 
technology plays that they might find as a result from these utilities moving 
forward with plant modifications or capacity increases.

Any NSR regulatory changes will be fought over the longer-term (with 
resistance from environmentalists), and could also likely be addressed in the 
multipollutant debate -- see below.

Long Term Opportunities/Advocacy

Multipollutant legislation -  A regulatory program that all at once 
streamlines regulation of NOx, SO2 and mercury as well as provides relief 
from NSR requirements could be extremely beneficial for EGM's emissions 
trading and technology businesses (as well as a number of other Enron 
businesses).   Nationwide trading for these pollutants would open up markets 
and create liquidity far beyond the current programs.   Regulatory certainly 
for generators seeking to upgrade, expand and improve efficiency at power 
plants could provide incentives for technology and risk management services.

Our Environmental Strategies group has developed a multipollutant plan that 
achieves a number of goals for Enron, including nationwide cap-and-trade for 
3 (or even 4, if CO2 is included) pollutants in a way that provides 
incentives for new technologies, promotes fuel diversity, and has economic 
safeguards in place.   We've structured it to have multiple benefits to 
Enron, and we are working on getting key Administration and congressional 
officials to adopt our ideas.   We're making progress, but expect this debate 
to go on for at least a few years.

Here are some excerpts from recent slides summarizing our plan, if you're 
interested.



Please let us know if you have any questions - we are happy to work with you 
and anyone in EGM to take advantage of opportunities in these environmental 
proposals.

The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution 
set for late June. Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be 
rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and 
should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your 
busy schedule.

Here is a suggested outline.  If you want to fill in the outline with 
information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.

 I.  An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward.

 II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes

           III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM
     (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) 

Please feel free to modify as you see fit.  I have attached Greg Whalley's 
letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help you.  I need your letter by June 15, if 
possible.

",Mike John Massey,,
1104,"Working with Amitava Dhar,  Vasant Shanbhogue and John Best,  we completed 
the following analysis to determine max loss for our portfolio of 
transactions for the balance of 2001.

A Model simulation yields max loss of less than $60 million for our total 
portfolio in 2001.

 Comments:  We ran several simulations in the model with 10,000 trials 
showing a max loss without hedges of $49,500,000 - $52,000,000. In 
otherwords, the  highest possible loss experienced in all runs was less than 
$52 million.  We also ran one simulation at 30,000 trials and the max loss 
did not vary   significantly from the earlier trials. Our conclusion from the 
results of the model runs is that the 1 in 100,000 trial would produce a max 
loss (P99.999) of less  than $60 million vs the notional P100 payout of $280 
million.

 This does not address the ""Venus falling into the Sun"" scenario. Since 
running the simulation does not produce a max loss approaching the P100, we 
had  to go outside the model and create a spread sheet that would force a 
scenario that generated the full loss.

B.  Worst case scenario of all units down on day 1 hits maximum payout of 
$280 million over 5 days.

 Comments: In the spread sheet we assumed an unrealistic scenario that all 
units go down on day one for 5 days. Taking the total MWh covered for each  
unit, we then calculated the power price necessary to hit the maximum dollar 
payout for each unit given a 5 day outage. The 5 day price spike for each  
power market ranged from $1,500 in Entergy to $700 in PJM. Under this 
unrealistic scenario we would reach our maximum payout of $280 million in 5 
days.

C. Power option hedges generate offsetting cash value of $ 215 million, 
reducing our net P100 exposure to less than $65 million

 Comments: We then layered our proposed hedging strategy on top of the 
unrealistic spread sheet scenario in 2 above. Assuming the 5 day price spike  
replicated the forward curve in the MidWest during 1999, a spot market at 
$1,500 pulled forward prices up to a range of $250-$300/MWh. The option   
hedges we would put in place would cost $14-15 million and would yield $215mm 
in positive MTM to offset the payout  of $280 million, giving us the net  
Maximun risk of $65 million.

We need to present our calculations to Vince tomorrow morning to get his sign 
off and can then go over the analysis in detail with you and Greg immediately 
afterwards. We are still not recommending we put the full hedge in place to 
cover this unrealistic scenareo, but the analysis shows we can significantly 
cover the tail risk in our book without having insurance in place. Our 
recommendation remains to put a smaller hedge in place while we continue to 
pursue a insurance partner during the month of June.

Speak to you tomorrow.

A few other facts from Rick Causey's meeting yesterday with Mike Patrick and

profits (Section 16 in the SEC 1934 Act) regarding the FAS 140 and the 
restructure of the subordinated units in 3Q on which corporate development is 
working, (3) disclosure of the transaction and sensitivities due to the

most sense versus other EWS earnings.  I may need to ask you guys to call 
Rick on #4 to let him know how important this is for EGM and that Stan and

1125,"Yesterday afternoon we filed an intervention on behalf of Enron in regard to 
SLNG's current FERC application to amend the original FERC certificate at 
Elba Island.  The application is to changeout the existing vaporizers at the 
terminal and to install blending facilities to deal with higher heat value 
LNG coming in to the terminal.

Our intervention gave general support to the filing but reserved the right to 
comment at a later time after further analysis of the impact of introducing 
high heat value LNG into the downstream pipelines had been completed.

The intervention has been fully reviewed by Shelley Corman and we believe, as 
a result, the tone of the document is not adversarial.  Further to this, we 
discussed the intervention with SLNG's FERC staff, and after incorporating a 
few minor changes they requested, confirmed with them that they had no strong 
objections to the filing.

A copy of the document filed at FERC is attached below.

If you have any questions please give me a call (x56249).

Thank you

1126,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=

See below resignation letter of Ivan van Niekerk - this is a huge loss for 
our group, as Ivan was uniquely qualified to originate the South African

asking him to reconsider as I believe that we are capable of addressing all 
of his complaints.  Unfortunately, Ivan indicates that he has already made up 
his mind and that he does not want to go back on his word to his prospective 
employer.  He will give it some thought overnight and I will speak with him 
again tomorrow (Fri).  This is an example of the toll that excessive

contract with Gordonsville, the letter should be changed to reflect the 
proper entity.  I removed the discussion concerning demand for cover from 
Citgo.  Per our discussion, we don't have that right under the contract, and 
since our contract is best efforts, Gordonsville doesn't have the right to 
demand cover.  I think this letter should be strictly a notice out of curtesy

you represent here.  We did not check this with Tom Balcerowiz and he needs 
to take a look at it.  Have your technical people gotten with Tom yet on any 
of these issues?  If not then we can run it down on this end.  

Our only concern was that reliability between Gulf's 230 kv system and AEC's 
115 kv system was not addressed.  It was our understanding that this was a 
question of the PSC staff.  Are there plans to provide any information 
concerning this item, or is no information available from AEC for such 
assessment?

Any word concerning WFEC's response to our petition or any filings they have 
made with the PSC?

Deer All:

Keith, great looking buck! Chris, I can't believe you passed that deer up. 
Very generous.

Chad shot a nice 10 point. Very impressive hunt. He hunted boneyard in the 
morning, then hopped the fence into the robertson pasture and rattled the 
deer withing 10 yards or so and managed to connect on a running shot as the 
deer bolted away.

I fed my Python a gobbler at LoneStar. Then shot a solid schlocho at the 
Hole sunday morning.

Pictures forthcoming.

Joe's beginner's honeymoon has come to an end. He saw nothing decent 
everywhere he went.

Brian saw an impressive young 9 pt at booger. Jim videotaped it the next 
morning. 21"" wide or so, short tines. Very tempting deer, but all agreed 
that it was 4.5 and should go another year.

Dogs could not find Jim's deer. Dogs headed from last blood due south to 
fence at highway.

Feeders are all in good shape, except Boneyard. It is running at 7 and 4:30. 
But weak. Chris indicated it needed a bigger battery. We considered putting 
a magnum on it, but if all it needs is a new battery, we'll leave it to you. 
We should get it running well, lots of deer in that area. One good schlocho 
and a bladed spike that needs to be shot. I put a new battery in Lonestar 
and we filled it up. Booger topped off with motor run time increased. 30-30 
was empty. We filled it up. Pig filled up an run time increased. We have 
lots of corn, so if a feeder is not dropping lots of corn, turn up the spin 
time and keep em full. Dropping extra corn also worked well at mesquite and 
showtime..
Mertz will feed protien next week. I consulted with Chris and houston boys 
openning weekend regarding mertz offer to let us buy extra protien this 
fall, since he had met the quota. We agreed to see what he would feed but 
cap it at $500, spread across the board.

Looks like Houston boys will be retruning December 15th weekend and closing 
weekend. I'll be bringing Henry on next trip and think it would be great if 
Keitha nd boys would be there too.

Hope Keith and Jim can make it back as soon as possible. We winterized 
trailer on way out. Keg almost empty.

Here are the updates for the following contracts:

MCV contracts have been cured for the month of February 2002.  Supply was purchased from MidAmerican Energy.  A prepayment of  $1,158,864.00 was wire to MidAmerican on January 30, 2002.

		Trunkline-ELA	$2.08	11,100		$   646,464

Based on our meeting with Kinder Morgan regarding NGPL-NSS storage contract# 114786 and #114846.  They are expecting demand payment for the month of December (They are allowing January charges to be paid at a later date) from ENA before allowing us to do a permanent release and/or an in-field transfers.  Ruth C. is in the process of filing out a cash request and wire transfer form.  She will then submit it for approval and to the cash management committee.  This process normally takes 5 days.  We are recommending that the process is expedited so that we can get the storage service and inventory sold.    If we pay today, we could potential sell these assets as soon as Friday.


I will be out on Monday.  If this deal does not close Friday, I will give Joe Parks the necessary information to close the deal on Monday.

The gears are beginning to turn for  the 2002 Richey Cousin Reunion. Judith, Kathy & I have started planning  and at this point about the only thing we can confirm are dates in case any  of you need to put it on your work schedule. So the dates  are:
 
    Erie's Reunion is the 15th of July  through the 20th. 
Rodeo Nights July 16th  & 17th
    Bean  Night July 19th
 
The Richey Cousin Reunion will  cover July 18th through Sunday, July 21st. 
 
Linda Richey Graves has  graciously set aside Saturday evening, July 20th, for us to visit Cedar Crest.  Perhaps a block of rooms could be secured somewhere in Topeka for those that  would be flying out on Sunday and those wanting rooms could enjoy breakfast  together before departure. We will see what the response is for that  suggestion. So if any of you want to make flight reservation, perhaps this  information will help. Just keep this for future  reference.
 
Saturday, July 20th,  will be the busy day. If any of you have ideas for a family parade float, please  share them with us.  We have access to trailers if we know what we want to  do. Maybe The Richey's can win the Family Float  Prize. 
 
So please place these  dates on your calendar and make whatever plans that need to be done. We look  forward to seeing as many of you that can be here.

at FirstEnergy called earlier.  I had called them last week after we found 
all the deals to make up for what they invoiced us for June's production.  We 
had some volume differences that Mark called to discuss.  On two of the deals 
(281431 and 308806), we have a total volume of 108,000 and 6,007 
respectively.  They invoiced us for 117,180 and 6,512. He claims our volumes 
are in mcf's and that if you apply the conversion factor of 1.085, you come 
up to his numbers.  The question is - who's right?? - Do we input mcf's in 
Sitara and if so, how can we get them adjusted to the dt's they invoiced us 
for?  And if our numbers are already in dt's, why does he think they're not?

.    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date contains 
the
volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.    The AGL volumes are not current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Re:      Template Answer

           The Coordinating Counsel Committee has asked me to solicit 
proposals for a firm to draft and circulate a template answer to the Grynberg 
complaints.   Analysis and drafting of affirmative defenses should be more 
cost effective for everyone if one firm develops a template.  There may also 
be fact allegations, e.g. those respecting scientific propositions, where 
efficiency and consistency can be promoted by use of a template.   I suggest 
we aim to have the template available for circulation and comments by June 
20th.  The separate counsel for individual defendants would retain the 
responsibility for the sufficiency of the answers filed for their clients.   
If your law firm is interested in undertaking this scope of work, please send 
me a very brief proposal to describe how you would staff this and an estimate 
of the fees involved, for review by the Coordinating Counsel Committee.

	Just a heads-up:

	Today at 1:30 there will be a joint defense conference call to discuss the thoughts of the group on what pleadings to file on or before December 5, the new deadline for defendants to move, answer or otherwise plead.  I believe that I previously e-mailed to you drafts prepared by F&J for El Paso and circulated to the group.  Each of the defendant groups is planning to prepare and file its own pleas to the jurisdiction, answers, and affirmative defenses.  I will prepare and circulate drafts tailored to the only two Enron defendants yet served, Enron Corp. and Intratex.  By copy of this, I am asking Becky Stephens to again confirm that we have no evidence that Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. has been served.

	A strategy issue under consideration is whether to file motions to transfer venue for the holding companies, like Enron Corp. So far, based on the due diligence I have done to date, it does not appear that Enron Corp. ever owned or operated any facilities in Zapata County (much less measured gas there) or owned any gas reserves or gas in storage, which should be the relevant considerations. I was asked by the joint defense group to do some legal research on this issue, given that Grynberg has made ""in concert"" allegations against all the defendants, and that we expect Grynberg to rely on venue being good against EOG Resources and trying to keep the remaining defendants (those who are not measurers and therefor independently subject to venue) based on section 15.005 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which allows venue against co-defendants in situations like this where the allegations concern the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurences.  

	In short, the caselaw I have seen causes me a concern we may open ourselves up to merits discovery on the ""in concert"" allegations by filing a motion to transfer venue on behalf of the holdling companies.  I have already mentioned that to other defense counsel and expect that issue to be discussed at our telephone conference this afternoon.

	Also, please let me know whether you want me to send any of the proposed pleadings to Barrett Reasoner or Charlie Tetrault, or to discuss our strategy Barrett or Charlie, to coordinate with strategy in the Grynberg and Quinque cases.

	Parenthetically, our due diligence investigation of Intratex has revealed an accounting document which appears to list an Intratex facility in Zapata County.  This makes no sense and is very puzzling to those we have interviewed at Enron about it.  We will be meeting later this week with AEP employees who will hopefully be able to shed some light on this.
	
	I will keep you advised.

Sue,

I noticed Hoecker's statement too.  I do not, however, believe that he is 
breaking new legal ground here, although the reference to Section 309 is (I 
believe) the first time in these cases that FERC or any of the individual 
Commissioners cited specifically to this section of the FPA as possible 
authority for ordering retroactive refunds prior to the 10/2/00 ""refund 
effective date.""  (I have attached Hoecker's opinion; the reference to 
Section 309 is on page 11.)

Section 309 is the provision of the FPA that grants FERC authority to take 
action ""necessary and proper"" to carry out the other substantive provisions 
of the Act, such as ensuring ""just and reasonable"" rates under Section 206 of 
the Federal Power Act; however, the courts have interpreted Sec. 309 as not 
expanding FERC's substantive authority otherwise granted under other 
provisions of the Act; it only provides FERC with authority as necessary for 
it to fill in the ""missing blanks"" in the substantive provisions of the Act, 
such as Sec. 206.)

Several years ago, FERC ordered retroactive refunds in a Washington Water 
Power case where the utility had violated its tariff.  Here, Hoecker is 
simply suggesting that FERC could do the same if it turns out that any seller 
violated the ISO's or PX's tariff last summer by engaging in ""collusion, 
predatory pricing, or unlawful manipulation of prices.""  As long as EPMI 
followed  the ISO's and PX's market rules last summer, I see nothing in 
Hoecker's opinion that undermines our view that the filed rate doctrine 
prevents refunds of all amounts collected in accordance with the market rules 
prior to 10/2/00; i.e., in the absence of a violation of the tariff or FPA, 
nothing in Hoecker's opinion suggests that Sec. 309 modifies the prohibition 
of Sec. 206 against retroactive refunds prior to the refund effective date 
(10/2/00).

taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT 
good.  Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not 
too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a 
force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm 
right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the 
charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager 
to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance 
Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.  My 
condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .

I just got back from London Tuesday and am now almost fully recovered from 
the jet lag.  I had an absolutely incredible time while I was over there and 
was even able to go into the Enron office for a while.  One of the guys I 
knew here in Houston even set up an impromptu interview for me while I was 
there so I think my working over there may be a very real possibility.  Since 
I'd already done a lot of the touristy things the last time I was in London 
Emily and I pretty much just hung out.  We went out to eat Friday night and 
then to a club ( I think we got home around 4 am after indulging in some fish 
and chips).  Saturday and Sunday we mostly just wondered around the city to 
various shops and markets and went out to various lunch and dinner venues.  
Finally, on Monday I went in to the office while Em was at school and then 
had a fairly big last night in town with some friends of Emily's.  Hope 
everything's been going well with you and that the move into your new place 
was a success.  I'll keep checking for great fares out to SD...I'd love to 
meet your roommate and all of your other friends I feel as though I know now.

1304,"Colleagues:
I hope that a short note on methodology on accomplishments' valuation will be 
of help to all of us at this stage.  Up to this moment, the current criteria 
is still the same established by Jim, John, and Gia Team in the last two 
years.  Its purpose was, and still, is to ensure that Public Affairs 
continues to generate more value than actual expense.    The process, 
hopefully, should drive GA staff to view themselves as ""originators"" creating 
bottom-line value through (as an example):
revenue enhancement (new opportunity, market expansion)
cost reduction (e.g., fee delay, rate decrease).

The value calculation process focused on the following rules (called SCORE):
Simplicity
Consistency
Objectivity
Reasonableness
Equity

Perhaps it is helpful  to list some of the methodologies submitted so far.  
With no specific preference, they are: 
 A percentage of Enron's business on a specific hub, or transmission 
connection (the percentage is subjectively determined)
 Impact of a specific deal on Enron's stock price (in total or part, again, 
subjectively determined)
 The result of what-if analysis to estimate the would be cost had the 
legislation passed (or did not pass), or a settlement reached (or not reached)
The amount of financing needs that was secured for a deal
NPV of a project.  An extension would be the size of market identified or 
deals originated.
The market size that Enron is targeting.
Value at risk in a specific project or activity
The methodology adopted by the relevant regulatory regimen to calculated  
specific cost item that have been deferred, reduced, or avoided.  An 
extension would be the impact of tariffs determination after intervention (in 
part or total).
The buy/sell spread of a portion of the market size that was released after 
intervention.

I shall keep you posted with any change--in any case, it  shall not happen 
without full consultation with you--meanwhile, please let me know if you have 
any question in this regard.

During the RCR Meeting last Monday an RCR of $30 K (US) was approved for legal and consulting support in relation to the ATCO Affiliate Code of Conduct Application.  I was asked by the RCR Committee to summarize the issues we intended to pursue once we had completed a review of the filing.  Below is an email I sent to our lawyer, Harold Huber, instructing him on the areas I wanted him to focus on in his cross examination and argument.  I believe these are fundamental code areas/issues that are of interest to Enron's operations in Alberta/Canada and therefore we should proceed to have our counsel pursue these at the hearing as was envisioned with the RCR request and subsequent approval.  Please let me know if anyone disagrees with me on this.

      Not much new here.  The Sox have made a great recovery but I am afraid
it might be a little late.  They have too many on the injury lists (4)
including Frank Thomas out for most of the rest of the season. They did take
the series from the Cubs but the Cubs have been playing over their heads and
are not as good as their record indicates.

after 16 years service.  I bought a new one and have a man lined up to
install it over the weekend.  I am going back to New Kensington for my 60th

1326,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=

ZERO EVIDENCE FOR ZERO TOLERANCE IN SCHOOLS - Can the use of zero
tolerance in school discipline improve student behavior or lead to safer

non-dangerous behavior places an increasing number of students at risk for
being removed from school, those risks are in no way justified by the
results of the policy.

IN THE NEWS...
Many Adults Have Obesity Syndrome
A recent study from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention found that at least 47 million Americans - more than one in five - have the cluster of health problems known as metabolic syndrome.  This condition, thought to be caused by a combination of genes and lifestyle factors, such as overeating and lack of exercise, includes heaviness around the waist, high blood pressure, poor cholesterol readings and elevated blood sugar.  Metabolic syndrome greatly increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke.

One Step Closer to a Cure
In Type 1 diabetes, which occurs in nearly one million Americans, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, stopping insulin production and wreaking havoc on blood sugar levels.  For this reason, people with Type 1 diabetes must administer insulin to themselves on a carefully controlled basis. Researchers at Harvard Medical School recently found that in mice, the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas can regenerate themselves, giving hope that this new method of fighting the disease could draw science closer to a cure.

To learn more, click here: http://www.you-click.net/GoNow/a16366a50772a99406973a1

Aspirin Therapy for Hearts Defended
Aspirin has long been the basis of blood thinning treatment for people with cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack and stroke.  It is not, however, usually prescribed for those that have conditions that put them at risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels and chest pain.  Recent research could change this.  A report from Oxford University in England shows that small doses of aspirin (75-100 milligrams per day) significantly lower the risk of heart attack or stroke for those at high risk due to related conditions.

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

thing I heard on it this morning was that it's still pending credit. Tracy is 
in a meeting right now, but I'll grab her as soon as she gets out (she sits 
next to me) and find out what the status is. Unfortunately, Tracy said when a 
deal is ""pending credit approval"" it's a little vague as to when the decision 
will be made. Mike Swerzbin told her last night that he wasn't concerned 
about whether or not the deal was approved, so without the trader on credit's

I have added language to Section 9 that addresses specific Argentine issues.  
My comments  are in blue in the document that I have attached.    

Since Marval will be looking at the legal issues  and since I know that they 
had good tax counsel as well, I will be using them for tax advice for this 
project so that the relevant legal and tax issues can be discussed among 
members of the firm.

The turnover tax will of course be an issue with the EOL physical trades in 
Argentina.   I have not raised that issue since it is being addressed

1376,"Hello Cathy and Ed-

Just wanted to let you know my progress on cost estimates and documents.

The paperwork will be broken down into two documents for the initial phase.  
The first is a ""Commitment"" letter (an LOI of sorts) for just the free 
posting system we have been talking about.  It will be followed by a full 
blown ""Electronic Transacations Agreement"" that I am sure will take much 
longer for all our lawyers to get through.  I need to get the LOI's done to 
show our management here the level of commitment we have from our initial 
launch pipelines, and it should be to you within the week.  I am hoping this 
short document will not have a tough time getting through your legal 
processes.  The next document (ETA) will closely follow the LOI's, but I know 
will be more of a negotiation since that is where the real details are 
spelled out.

We are still in the process of finalizing the costs (Gap Analysis) and the 
deliverables for the GIR settlement system requirements.  I should have more 
information on this by the end of the week.

We unfortunately have had some slippage on the start date of phase one due to 
some scope changes, and personnel issues.  We are definately looking into 
first quarter of next year, so that buys us some time with getting the 
documents through our respective legal departments.  I apologize for this 
delay, but once we have the signed LOI's back in our shop, we will be able to 
lock down a launch date.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.",,,Enron Corp. Savings Plan Savings Plan Hewitt and Northern Trust Enron

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

I have a few questions to ask regarding natural gas.

1. Do you require a new customer to have a minimum load?  Is there also a
maximum?

2. Must they be in a particular territory, for example SoCalGas?

3. What length contracts are you offering?

4r. What financial hedges do you offer?  NGI, Fixed, Caller (ceiling / floor

5. Are you looking for agency relationships?  Do you pay a commission if
business is brought to you?

Paul and Marydith flew to Atlanta.  Marydith's first flight.  The good news 
is there's nothing much to say about her flying.  Also not much of any delays 
due to extra security.  Not to be unpatriotic but I think a few of the new 
rules are the same ones the airlines have been trying to pass for a while but 
couldn't until they could claim security.  

Savannah was nice.  Kind of like our weekend last Oct in Arkansas.  Lots of 
old buildings and tourist type shops.  

Judy is gearing up for the big bash on Bolivar next weekend.  The kids and I 
have not made any definite plans.

In a no where else but TX story.  I rode my bike tonight out through the 
flood plain.  I came across a small herd of cows.  The half on the left got 
startled and ran across the bike path and the group on the right crossed the 
other way so I ended up looking like the slot man on the Blue Angels as I 
emerged from the crossing cows.  Having had fun on the way South I realized 
the only way home at night is back North on the same path so about 10 minutes 
later I come back to find the bull standing across the path.  Remembering the 
old adage normally said about dogs ""Speed is Life"" I played chicken with him 
keeping the option open to cut behind him.  He blinked and moved off the 
path.  

John, any plans for next weekend?  ",Grandpa Renee Judy Marydith John,,the Blue Angels
