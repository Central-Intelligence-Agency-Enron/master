0,"Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple 
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.  

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, 
maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagan 
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to 
keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the 
left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.  That 
might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch 
would 
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead and 
have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned my 
alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed 
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan 
allowed.

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

26,"Fred- 

There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately.  We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.

2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.  

""I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out"" 
""It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade"" 
""We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for"" 
""We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type"" 
""I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here"" 


From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said ""they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. 

The latest is the most disturbing:

""we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude"" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed

We do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the ""backoffice""?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).

We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  

All the problems are being caused by the following:

1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.

There are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.

Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.

2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  

We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.

2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.

2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. 

3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  

4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.

Vikings' Wynn Might Get a Chance To Show His Stuff

Kent Youngblood
Star Tribune

Published Dec 21 2001

Spergon Wynn was making the rounds. From meetings to a one-on-one interview
with FOX TV to a photo shoot.

All the accouterments of a starting quarterback. But Wynn, to his credit,
remained unimpressed throughout. People around Winter Park have been talking
this week about Wynn being more mature than his 23 years. So it was no
surprise Wynn wasn't about to put that cart in front of the horse.

""I still haven't played yet,"" he said, walking from the photo shoot back to
the meeting room; he still had tape to watch. ""Once you see results on the
field, that's when you start to feel comfortable.""

Because of this week's rule of thumb, Wynn might go from prospect to
participant, continuing his ascent up the Vikings' depth chart. On Thursday,
Daunte Culpepper underwent surgery to repair his injured left knee. On the
practice field, Todd Bouman took some very limited reps in practice. The
good news is the swelling in his sprained thumb has stayed down.

""It's not too bad,"" Bouman said. ""It's getting better each day. I took a few
reps here and there, just to get a feel for what we're doing this week. ...
I'll probably take most of everything [today].""

Wynn, meanwhile, took the bulk of the snaps, as he did Wednesday. And while
the decision on Bouman won't be made at least until after the Vikings see
what he can do in practice today, Wynn appears to be edging closer and
closer to his first action in a Vikings uniform.

It's something a lot of people are interested to see. At first glance Wynn
looks like the prototype of a quarterback. He's 6-3, 226 pounds. A good
athlete with above-average mobility. He's got a strong arm and a quick
release; his spirals are tight and his long ball impressive. But, like a
good-looking automobile in a showroom, nothing will be known for sure until
he's actually taken the offense for a serious spin.

And all he got last year in Cleveland, really, was a drive around the block.

Last year as a rookie, injuries in Cleveland thrust Wynn from the No. 3 spot
into the action. He appeared in seven games, starting one. Playing behind a
leaky offensive line, he completed 22 of 54 passes for 167 yards and one
interception while being sacked 13 times. But for Wynn, it showed him one
thing -- that he belonged.

""You have to make positives out of negatives,"" Wynn said. ""The outcome may
not have been what I would have liked. But you learn a lot of valuable
information out there, just playing. I feel more comfortable with myself and
my abilities having gone through it.""

The Vikings liked Wynn enough to trade for him Sept. 3, primarily because of
what he had gone through. Wynn, a native of Bellaire, Texas, originally came
to the University of Minnesota before transferring to Southwest Texas State.
He played in a Bobcat offense that featured the vertical passing game,
throwing for 3,497 yards in two seasons.

The Vikings were interested in Wynn coming out of college, and were
impressed with his ability to adapt to the Browns' offensive philosophy,
going to more of a West Coast attack in Cleveland. They watched as he played
well in 10 starts for Amsterdam in NFL Europe.

Dennis Green, who has done a good job of developing quarterbacks, was happy
to trade a fifth-round draft choice for Wynn and running back Travis
Prentice.

""Any time you trade for a player, the first thing you do is go back to his
college days,"" Green said. ""You want to know exactly what you thought of him
when he came out of college. We liked him a lot. I liked him lot. I think he
has a lot of athletic ability, he's a good competitor, a very smart player,
had the right height.""

No one expected Wynn to play this quickly. But with Culpepper recovering
from surgery and Bouman's thumb sore, Wynn has been preparing for that
possibility, though he has not let his excitement get the best of him.

""Spergon is even keel, all the time,"" said defensive end Stalin Colinet, who
played with Wynn in Cleveland last season. ""But he's a fighter.""

Whether he'll get a chance to fight this weekend remains unclear. Wynn said
the extra reps this week will have him as prepared as he can be.

""I don't think I'll do anything surprising,"" he said. ""But I'll go out there
and compete, make good decisions, put my team in a position to score
points.""


*********** Our View ************

Tough call for Bouman owners.   You know he's dying to get out there and
showcase his abilities.  It's a golden opportunity for him with Culpepper
out so he's surely got motivation to be there.   But they sure seem to be
talking a lot about Wynn.   Hopefully, we'll know more late tonight.

I wish I had something definitive for you but at this point, I'm just
passing along to you everything I see on this.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

104,"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

	In August we were discussing the additional information needs that Corporate Development has re: an electronic repository for the original models, pitch books, research, etc. on assets/deals, plus any current work Corporate Development, the business unit or RAC may have done.  Some of the information Corp Dev was interested in was financial data for each asset (EBITDA, NI, debt, etc.) that I think could be added to the PortRac system.  The remainder of the data Corp Dev was looking to have on hand electronically was to be part of a new livelink application that Cornelio was going to help develop.  The attached ppt file describes the user needs for this development project.  

The question is - Who is the new business unit sponsor since I've left the group?  The information is not dissimilar to what RAC/Underwriting maintain, plus RAC/Underwriting have the right staff to maintain the livelink application.  It's just a matter of getting the right approvals for this additional work load to be budgeted for Rick Carson's group and also having the group meet with various Corp Dev folks (use the ppt file attached) to establish the support relationship.

113,"We received preliminary sample results yesterday. Sample #1 (TPH = 97 mg/kg) 
and Sample #2 (TPH = 121 mg/kg) were collected from the east wall of the 
excavation about 2 feet outside the NNG facility fence and about 4 feet below 
ground surface. Sample #3 (TPH = 22400 mg/kg) was collected from the east 
wall of the excavation about 8 feet outside the NNG facility fence and about 
8-10 feet below ground surface. There was little visual evidence that this 
soil sample was affected, but apparently it is. 

In my discussions with Texaco's consultant, I inquired about their sample 
analysis plan. He indicated that they were submitting soil samples for TPH 
analysis by method 8015mod (GRO & DRO). I was concerned about comparing 
results from the 8015mod analysis to our older data generated by method 
418.1. In light of this I submitted our samples for analysis by method 418.1. 
The 8015mod method is a more compound specific analysis than the 418.1 method 
and often the more appropriate method to use. However, in this case it may 
not be the most appropriate method. The 8015mod method is a GC method used to 
measure the mass of hydrocarbon compounds that will elute within specific 
time windows. The first time window is set up to measure the mass of gasoline 
range organics (GRO). The second time window is set up to measure the mass of 
diesel range organics (DRO). Any hydrocarbon compounds that elute after the 
DRO time window are not measured. This would not be an issue if the soil was 
contaminated with a light condensate, but Texaco's oil pit was reportedly 
used to accumulate liquids not suitable for feed stock to the plant. I think 
we can assume this meant heavy hydrocarbons. The 418.1 method is a less 
sophisticated method that measures petroleum hydrocarbon compounds over a 
wider range of carbon number, that is, it will measure the presence of 
heavier hydrocarbons that would not be measured using method 8015mod. In 
light of this, the 418.1 method is likely the more appropriate method for 
assessing soil affected by the Texaco oil pit, particularly when results are 
compared to older data generated using method 418.1.

I have requested our lab to confirm the results for Sample #3 using method 
418.1. In addition, I have asked that they run the sample using method 
8015mod (GRO & DRO) so that we can compare the two results. We should have 
these results later next week. I would like to get this additional 
information and discuss it among ourselves before we respond to Texaco. Right 
now I am inclined to say that the Texaco oil pit is neither implicated or 
cleared as the culprit of contamination found in NNG's monitor well MW-3.

119,"For those teams that have turbines installed after 1990 and/or for those 
turbines which have undergone power  unit changouts, the following 
recordkeeping and monitoring conditions apply:

1) DAILY recordkeeping of nitrogen and sulfur must be taken of the fuel gas 
which supplies the applicable turbine(s). 

2) This recordkeeping consists of electronic recording (gas chromtograph for 
nitrogen and  delmar or equivelant for sulfur) or stain tubes may also be 
used  for sulfur. These DAILY records include measurements on Saturdays and 
Sundays.

3) The measurement must be taken at the location.  An exception to this is 
that the nitrogen and sulfur measurements may be taken upstream or 
downstream  of the applicable turbine facility provided that there are no 
natural gas deliveries into the pipe which would interfere or dilute/increase 
the measurements  for the applicable turbine fuel gas. 

4) Fuel gas records in hard copy form or equivalent  for  the nitrogen and 
sulfur must be maintained at the facility or at a central location for easy 
retrival.  

5) A turbine facility may waiver out of this nitorgen and sulfur daily 
recordkeeping requirement by obtaining a custom fuel monitoring schedule 
(CFMS) from  the EPA.  Approval of a  CFMS allows a greatly reduced 
recordkeeping and reporting for nitrogen and sulfur.  CFMS requests have been 
submitted for the  following facilities:

   P-1 C/S
   Plains Turbine C/S
   Atoka No 2 C/S
   Monument C/S
   Crawford C/S
   Bloomfield C/S
 
Approvals have not as yet been obtained.  Until issuance of a CFMS, an 
applicable facility is required to continue daily sampling for nitrogen and 
sulfur.   
 
Facilities which have received CFMS from the EPA include:

   La Plata C/S
   P-2 C/S

Please be advised that there may be certain reporting requirements that might 
be required for each CFMS.  I would strongly advise that the La Plata and 
Panhandle  teams review their CFMS and include reporting dates into MCS, so 
that the deadlines and reportings are not missed. 

If you have a turbine facility which is subject to the nitrogen and sulfur

121,"Hello everyone, 

	It was a tough week overall this week with several games going down as upsets. College games were overall better than the pros this week. No one correctly picked the Clemson victory over Georgia Tech. Also no one picked New England over Indy, Cleveland over Jacksonville or Baltimore over Denver. We have a 3 way tie heading into the Monday night game tonight, with 
Rick Broussard, Rob Benson and Todd DeCook still alive, all with 5 incorrect picks. Rick picked San Francisco tonight with 37 total points scored, Rob picked San Fran with 41 points and Todd picked the Jets with 52 total points. Therefore, it will first come down to who wins the game tonight, as if the Jets win, Todd will win it outright. If the 49ers win, then it will come down to total points. If there is 40 or more points scored, Rob will win, 38 or less, Rick will win, 39 there will be a tie. We had 28 entries this week, therefore the prize is $56. The following is who played this week with total incorrect picks next to each person's name.

129,"Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

What an exciting story!  I am sure that you are anxiously awaiting being reunited with Alina.  I know that the bureaucracy for an international adoption can be quite extensive.

I hope that the procedure will come to a closure soon so that you can come to bring her home with you!   

I was, indeed, able to travel back to Kazakhstan last month without any significant problems.  I was on the first BA flight Houston-London after the attacks, so the lines were huge, but there was no problem with the flights themselves or with security.  It just took more airport time.   

In Kazakhstan, the situation is currently peaceful.  The government here seems concerned with protecting its borders and American interests.  We are in contact with the American embassy here, and have made contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates, but we feel fine about remaining here at this time.

	The following is a recap of the status of the implementation of the PGAS calculation for
	31 day charts and 31 day index cards.

	Beginning with March production (April Billing), GMS will have the new calculation
	in PGAS for 31 day charts and 31 day index cards.  This calculation is to give NNG
	more representation of daily estimated volume for billing purposes.  As a reminder
	the 31 day charts and 31 day index cards will NOT be processed using the
	delineator.  The calculation is considered to be representative of the daily volume
	and no PPA's will be processed on the calculated estimates.

	At this time there will NOT be a daily PGAS calculation on 7 day and 16 day charts.
	These charts will by (1) tracked for timely receipt; and (2) integrated for daily volumes
	when received.

	Any charts received after the required deadline will be processed as a PPA.

	If anyone has any questions, please let Gary Anderson or I know.  Thanks. Lynn",Gary Anderson Lynn,,PGAS GMS NNG PPA

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

178,"The draft language on SB 27X appears to be consistent with ideas offered by
Bowen's staffer Lingbloom and TURN.  It makes the following changes in the
language the direct access coalition proposed:

1. It reinserts the provision allowing a customer to select direct
access for that portion of its load not served by DWR.  Neither the
utilities nor customers nor ESPs like this.  It should be deleted.

2. It provides for an open season to switch to DA until June 1 instead
of Oct 1 as the DA coalition proposed.  We believe customers will need more
time to choose what they want to do.

3. It omits the language in (d) of the DA coalition draft which ensures
all customers pay for unrecovered bond costs.  This can be covered by the
other language in the bill but it could leave some gaps.

4. Residential and small commercial DA is unrestricted only to the
extent of load growth on the entire utility system.  This may be too
restrictive to implement AB 48X easily.  It is also somewhat unfair to
allocate all load growth to the residential class.

5.  The language about large customers switching is ok, but fails to
clarify that the standard is limited to the long term contracts of DWR (> 1
yr.) so that we are not squeezed by their short term purchases, too.

6. It omits our language that customers can select DA on an first come
first served basis for each of  these ""open enrollement"" options.  This is
an important clarification.

7. It omits the required notices that DWR and large customers must give
each other that they are about to switch or have power contracts commence or
terminate.  This is important for large customers in particular so that they
know when they will have chances to elect DA as the DWR sheds contracts over
time.

8. It omits the section requring for public access to the exit fees or
their calculation in advance, so customers know what their choices are.
This is very important.


Bottom Line:  All the provisions they deleted from our proposal are
worthwhile and we would like to reinsert them.  They do not alter tha basic
framework of this amendment, they just make it work better.  ",Bowen Lingbloom,,DWR DA AB

","Barbara Barkovich

185,"(I feel like a reporter in a warzone)

The morning was taken up with Barbara Barkovich testifying for CLECA and 
CMTA.  She is a sharp witness and no one got anything off her she didn't want 
to give.  She gave a long prepared statement that addressed equity 
considerations, conservation, and added that reliability is a key factor to 
consider, and that any allocation and rate design should encourage efficieny 
use of energy, should not disadvantage nay particular group 
disproportionately, and should discourage use in the periods most likely to 
see outages.  The Top 100 hours as an allocator is equitable as it is an 
allocator that both accounts for capacity and energy use.  Barkovich had no 
problems with SCE's billing determinants, but did have issues with PG&E's, as 
she couldn't figure out the appropraite revenue requirement from their 
exhibits and workpapers.  She forgot to exclude CARE costs in her 
calculations (everyone else did too).  She noted that the classes all have 
customers with wide ranges of usage, and rates should be designed to 
encourage conservation.  Tiering might be a way to do that, but the problem 
is that the utilities have said that they can't do that right now.  CLECA and 
CMTA do have different approaches; CMTA wants significant rate increases in 
the on-peak rates, a lesser increase for mid peak and an even lesser increase 
for off-peak.  They prefer a broader spreading of costs than CLECA.  SInce no 
one knows what the DWR contracts look like, we cannot predict what, if any, 
shortfalls will occur in revenue collection.  The CLECA proposal to collect 
costs on peak will create the biggest bang for the buck in terms of reducing 
peak usage.  If usage shifts enough that the peak needs to be redefined, this 
can be done in a rate case.  Another problem with tiering, is that while the 
utilities do have records of each customer's historic usage, that information 
may not be readily available to the billing systems and may not be easy to 
get at.  She noted that a study is coming out tomorrow showing the impact of 
rolling blackouts on Northern California businesses, and will send that 
report in to the hearing examiner.  

She favors an even handed approach to increasing prices, and does not want to 
reallocate costs.  Keep the 130% residential shortfall in the residential 
class.  There will be some reallocation necessary to keep ag rates from being 
increased all the way.  The goal is to avoid reallocation as much as 
possible.  Practical considerations argue against setting an arbitrary kwh 
breakpoint, as some classes have a wide variety of users.  Tiering should be 
customer-specific and we need to find a way to do this.  The variablity of 
usage in the residential class is much less than other classes, and so 
tiering is less of an issue.  The Top 100 method allocates costs based on the 
class's relative share of of peak usage during the 100 hours of highest 
demand.  This means both demand and usage.  She agreed that DA customers 
should not pay the surcharge as the power is not being purchased for them.  
Shell's attorney questioned Barkovich at length about whether we shouldn't 
redevelop rates here from the bottom up and only charge  DA customers for T&D 
and other costs properly allocated to them (nuke decommissioning, public 
programs).  Ms. B noted that that would mean they would not pay CTC and would 
affect the PX credit.  

The Street and Traffic light witness testified, and if you want to know about 
the most efficient lights, call me

Kinder Morgan (our old friend Rich Kinder) which has products pipelines in 
CA, testified that they want an allocation that places costs on peak power 
usage, to a cap of 35 cents, and then also has a set-off to the demand charge 
to reduce any overrecovery.  The notion is that a customer who conserves is 
still paying a demand charge for peak power not used, and this is a 
disincentive to conservation.  

Aglet, which is a small consumer group, testified that there is no revenue 
requirement yet, since the DWR deals are secret, and so they recommend no 
reallocation of shortfalls, since shortfalls can't exist.  They support a 
limited dollar impact until the DWR rates are known.  This may  drive the 
revenue requirements closer to those of the Governor's.  The residential 130% 
shortfall and the CARE customers should be allocated to all other customers.  
He also supports an equal cents per KWH charge.  Increasing volatility of 
prices means you cant base future rates on past costs.  The world has changes 
drastically since May 2000 and old data is not indicative of future.  The top 
100 hours is a capacity allocator, not to be used for the type of costs at 
issue here.  

Harry goes on either 1st or 2nd tomorrow.  Also up are CIU, CEC, AReM and 
possibly ORA.    ",Barbara Barkovich Barkovich B Kinder Morgan Rich Kinder Aglet Harry,35 cents an equal cents,CLECA efficieny SCE PG&E DWR DA Shell CTC PX CARE CIU CEC AReM ORA

Jun. 2, 2001 
Associated Press Newswires 
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 

MEDFORD, Ore. (AP) - A hydropower firm has applied for a preliminary permit 
from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to study the feasibility of 
building a hydropower plant at Applegate Dam. 

Symbiotics LLC, a subsidiary of Northwest Power Services Inc., based in 
Rigby, Idaho, and Ecosystem Research Institute in Logan, Utah, want to 
retrofit the dam to produce about 12 megawatts of electricity. 

The dam, on the Applegate River about 20 miles south of Medford, currently 
has no hydropower capacity. It was built in 1980 by the U.S. Corps of 
Engineers.

""The price of energy has made it economical now to look at a project of this 
kind,"" said Hart Evans, a spokesman for ERI. ""We started looking at a lot of 
different dams this year to see what the potential is for hydropower plants.""

Applegate Dam is one of more than 100 dams for which ERI has filed 
preliminary permit applications in the Pacific Northwest, including Savage 
Rapids Dam on the Rogue River just upstream from Grants Pass, Evans said.

Northwest Power and ERI, which he described as an environmental consulting 
firm, have been working jointly on power projects for 25 years, Evans said.

Symbiotics was launched early this year to focus exclusively on hydropower, 
he said.

The permit, if granted, would give the firm three years to study the project, 
said FERC spokeswoman Celeste Miller in Washington, D.C.

""It does not authorize any construction,"" Miller said. ""If an applicant 
determines at the end of the permit period that they want to develop the 
project, then they would have to file for a license.""

They are a rate hawk out of San Juan Capistrano, CA. (So Cal).

They have approached Albertsons, who we are currently working with, about 
entering into an agreement with them.  They are promising a 15 - 20% savings 
($4-5MM) for their stores in SDG&E territory, just by putting them on another 
applicable utility rate that nobody is aware of  ""loop hole"".  Of course, 
they will not share this information until Albertsons has signed a contract.

The contacts we have been negotiating with have told them to get lost but USI 
went over their heads to senior management who is now asking for an 
explanation.

From a commodity origination and account management perspective a rate hawk, 
if hired, is just going to cause problems.

203,"Hi Jeff,

We met, at least telephonically, while I was still in EES' San Ramon office 
on some substation projects we were working on last year.  I've since moved 
on to Houston (all roads lead there, so they say), and am now in Structuring 
and working on some of the new, heavy industrial deals that EES has inherited 
from ENA. I've got a customer who is a petroleum refiner in Downey, CA - 
right in the middle of LA - who is interested in potentially building a cogen 
plant, perhaps as big as 49 MW. Air emissions issues completely aside (the 
nightmare can wait), can you tell me what the current status of new QF 
development is with SCE?  I've checked with all the commodity guys I know 
here on the floor, and they're not up to date.  Greg Cordell thought that, as 
part of AB1890, the UDCs got a moratorium on new QFs in their territory - as 
in, they don't have to accept any more projects.

Can you shed any light on the topic? If you're not the guy, do you know who I 
should talk to?

Thanks a bunch!

And maybe by knowing the names of my cabinet 
I can win their love for me 

Don't know much about air pollution

Don't know much about th'economy

But there's one thing that I know for sure

What a wonderful world this will be 

Don't know much about the national debt 
I've never had to pay one yet

cut the deal they're living with and 2) they took all of the ""stranded cost"" 
money that consumers paid them and invested it in other states and 
countries.  

But you can only buy for 10 cents and sell for 5 cents for so long before 
creditors turn off the spigot.  Difficult to see how the spigot stays on with 
the draft decision issued today.  (See story attached, below.)  

With bankruptcy, the only one making any decisions is the judge, and while 
some see benefits to that, seems to us that from a political, financial and 
commercial perspective, bankruptcy creates many more problems than it solves.

That said, we're extremely sensitive to the politics of rate increases.  But 
if the increases are subject to refund, then decision makers can buy 
themselves some time by erring just slightly to the high side of a rate 
increase, which could fend off the ratings agencies and provide additional 
opportunity over the next 90 days or so to scrutinize the utilities claims 
and come up with comprehensive solutions to the bigger problems.

Well, you got my two cents.  Sorry about that.

Late afternoon 1/3/01 news:


USA: Calif utility ratings may fall too far on 7-15 pct hike.
By Jonathan Stempel

01/03/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Bankruptcy may loom and the credit ratings of the 
two largest California electric utilities will likely fall too far if that 
state's Public Utilities Commission awards them an interim rate hike of 7 to 
15 percent, analysts said Wednesday.

In a draft decision on Wednesday, the CPUC proposed an immediate hike of 9 
percent for residential customers of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison, and hikes of seven to 15 percent for various business 
customers.

The CPUC commission is expected to issue a final decision on Thursday.

""It forces the utilities and their creditors to be limbo dancers, and skilled 
limbo dancers at that,"" said Shawn Burke, head of U.S. investment-grade 
research at Barclays Capital.

PG&E and SCE had requested respective rate increases of 26 percent and 30 
percent, a hike that would help them avoid imminent bankruptcy.

The utilities have also asked the regulators to remove a freeze on retail 
rates imposed under California's 1996 law that deregulated the state's 
electricity market.

On a day when most stocks roared ahead after the Federal Reserve announced 
surprise interest rate cuts, investors beat down the stocks of Pacific G&E's 
parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. , and SoCal Edison's parent, Edison 
International .

PG&E shares closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $17, down 
$2-9/16, or 13.1 percent, while Edison International shares closed at 
$12-1/4, down $2-3/4, or 18.3 percent, on the Big Board.

Bond quotations were not immediately available for the utilities' bonds, 
which in recent weeks have traded like junk.

Pacific G&E and SoCal Edison were banking on a big rate hike to allow them to 
pass on some of their soaring wholesale power costs to consumers.

The utilities, which operate under a rate freeze, have accumulated more than 
$8 billion in unrecovered costs since wholesale power prices started 
skyrocketing last summer amid a worsening electricity shortage in the state. 
They claim they are running out of money due to the price freeze, and have 
billions of dollars of bills coming due in the next six weeks.

Central to their concerns is whether credit rating agencies Moody's Investors 
Service and Standard & Poor's will cut their medium investment grades to junk 
status.

""No one knows for sure, but if we consider the average rate hike is only 
about 10 percent, it will be difficult for the companies to maintain 
investment-grade ratings,"" said Dorothea Matthews, a fixed-income electric 
utilities analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.

The utilities have already been unable to tap short-term capital markets 
because of their precarious financial state.

Downgrades to junk, which the agencies have already threatened, would cement 
the door shut to these markets, and cause the utilities to default on some of 
their loans.

Late Wednesday, PG&E Chief Executive Gordon Smith said the commission's 
proposed hikes could jeopardize his utility's future loans.

Even a downgrade to the lowest investment grades - ""Baa3"" for long-term debt 
and ""Prime-3"" for short-term debt from Moody's, and ""BBB-minus"" and ""A3"" from 
S&P - would make the going very difficult for the utilities. The reason: 
short-term debt markets are often closed to companies with those ratings.

""Unless this process allows the rating agencies to keep 'A2/P2' ratings on 
the short-term debt of both companies, then this process has largely been a 
waste of everyone's time,"" said Burke.

Still, he said, ""there is a reasonable chance, despite today's weak 
recommendation, that the situation can be salvaged with mid-'triple-B' 
ratings, which would allow a lifeline to conventional sources of liquidity.""

Moody's and S&P were not available for comment.

your concerns and have responded below appropriately. 

Question 1: my ""need"" would more appropriately be characterized as a
""desire"" (something that, according to my buddhism class yesterday, would be
beneficial to give up if I want to achieve true happiness). The desire,
however, is related to the possibility of spending a fair amount of time in
diving locations during my honeymoon. Due to the limited amount of vacation
time I am alotted from my employer, I am going to find it necessary to
forego all vacation opportunities for the next 10 months (other than this
week between Christmas and New Years) and hence find it necessary to use the
specified time to obtain the coveted certification. No, I am not interested
in getting certified in Monterey Bay. 

Question 2: As far as I know the weather is quite pleasant year round. I
know the place we intend to go is on an island off the eastern coast of
Honduras. I hope to provide you with a more deailed answer after consulting
reliable travel guides and weather almanacs. 

Question 3: The diving is supposed to be quite ""killer"" (as you put it). I
have a direct recommendation from my travel obsessed friend, jessica, who
just got certified there a couple months ago and has provided me with both
information and endorsements. Yes, Belizeis supposed to be very good also,

253,"California warns of possibility of rolling blackouts 
STEVE LAWRENCE, Associated Press Writer
Wednesday,?December 13, 2000 
,2000 Associated Press 
(12-13) 14:50 PST SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson ordered Northwest generators to sell electricity to California 
utilities Wednesday after state regulators warned that low power supplies 
could force rolling blackouts. 
The warning came from the Independent System Operator, keeper of California's 
power grid. It said that electricity supplies were so perilously low that it 
might declare a Stage 3 power emergency for only the second time ever. At 
Stage 3, the grid can impose blackouts. 
Richardson said at a Washington, D.C., news conference he was using emergency 
powers to force wholesalers to sell power to California at a price he deemed 
fair. He said he would also request that two large Pacific Northwest power 
generating associations send more power to California. 
``Our objective is to keep the lights on in California through this emergency 
situation,'' he said. ``We're dealing with a potentially very serious 
situation here.'' 
California has been caught in a power crunch over the past several days, in 
part because of cold weather in the Northwest -- where California buys much 
of its power -- and the shutdown of some generating plants for maintenance. 
California's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern 
California Edison, are near bankruptcy due to skyrocketing wholesale power 
costs, Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said at a 
Washington, D.C., news conference with Richardson. 
Davis and Feinstein asked federal regulators to set a regional price cap on 
wholesale electricity to prevent the high prices that have plagued 
California. On Friday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission lifted price 
caps in California. 
Record wholesale power prices followed, and PG&E warned it was in financial 
danger. 
The problem became especially acute when about a dozen suppliers began 
demanding cash before selling power to California, Kellan Fluckiger, the 
ISO's chief operating officer, said Wednesday. 
``The credit limits of utilities and what markets are willing to sell us have 
been reached and surpassed in many cases,'' Fluckiger said. ``There are 
questions about utility solvency. That has come to a head today.'' 
He said officials may have to interrupt power to as many as 4 million 
customers Wednesday afternoon and early evening, when people come home from 
work and power demand hits a peak. 
An unprecedented Stage 3 emergency was issued last Thursday, meaning reserves 
had fallen below 1.5 percent. But the state fended off rolling outages by 
turning off two power-sucking water pumps. 
This time, Fluckiger said any blackouts would probably last about an hour to 
90 minutes and occur mostly in Northern California. 
``It's a fairly bleak picture,'' he said. ``This thing will not change unless 
something is done to alleviate the credit situation.'' 
A Stage 1 alert was declared Wednesday morning, meaning power reserves were 
below 7 percent and all power users are asked to conserve. 
Stage 1 and Stage 2 emergencies, in which power reserves fall below 5 percent 
and large commercial customers can be forced to shut down, have become 
routine this month, but last Thursday's Stage 3 was the only time the threat 
of blackouts loomed. 
Contributing to the problem is a shortage of water to power hydroelectric 
generators in the Northwest and California, Fluckiger said. 
``We have reservoirs so low that we have people standing by them watching the 
situation to make sure it does not go below safe limits,'' he said. 
The power crunch over the past few months has been blamed in part on 
electricity deregulation. California approved a phased-in deregulation of the 
electricity market in 1996 to try to lower prices for consumers through 
competition, but so far it has led to higher energy prices. 
At the same time, wholesale power costs have been soaring, in large part 
because of skyrocketing prices for natural gas. Wall Street is worried about 
utilities' financial health, and on Tuesday, a consumer group urged the state 
to seize and run the strapped $20 billion electricity system.

268,"Williams Announces Major Expansion of Kern River Pipeline

SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 22, 2001--A unit of Williams (NYSE:
WMB - news) Thursday announced an expansion project on its Kern River
pipeline that will more than double the amount of natural gas transported on
the 926-mile pipeline system.

The 2003 Kern River Expansion Project will provide 900 million cubic feet
per day of additional transportation capacity from Wyoming to California by
May of 2003.

Last November, Williams held an open season to determine the level of
interest from shippers for additional transportation capacity from Rocky
Mountain basins to markets in Utah, Nevada, and California.

``We knew the demand was strong, however the response was even greater than
we anticipated. There is a tremendous demand for natural gas to fuel new
electric generation facilities in California and Nevada.

``This expansion provides shippers with an economically attractive
opportunity to secure additional firm year-round transportation,'' said Kirk
Morgan, director of business development for Kern River.

The more than $1 billion expansion project will loop approximately 700 miles
of the existing Kern River pipeline system. Williams plans to file an
application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in June.
All project issues -- including facility design, environmental studies,
rates and tariff provisions -- will be subject to review and approval by the
FERC.

Williams must also secure the necessary environmental and regulatory
approvals, and negotiate rights of way.

Last week, Williams filed a California Emergency Action application with the
FERC to install and operate emergency facilities on Kern River that would
increase capacity by approximately 19 percent over the current 700 million
cubic feet per day.

The $81 million emergency expansion project would add 135 million cubic feet
per day of firm transportation service into California by July 1, 2001, to
help meet the urgent need for additional energy this summer.

In November of 2000, Williams filed an application with the FERC for its
first expansion on Kern River, the 2002 California Expansion Project. The
application proposes the installation of compression to provide an
additional 124 million cubic feet per day of firm transportation service.

This $80 million project is targeted for completion by May 1, 2002 and
largely relies upon facilities previously installed as part of the pending
California Emergency Action expansion project.

``Shippers are seeking more access to natural gas from Rocky Mountain
basins, where producers are aggressively stepping up production. Kern River
is in the right place at the right time to help bring that production to
market,'' said Morgan.

Williams' gas pipeline unit is based in Houston and has offices in Salt Lake
City and Owensboro, Ky. Together, its five interstate natural gas pipelines
are among the nation's largest-volume transporters of natural gas,
delivering approximately 16 percent of the natural gas consumed in the
United States.

Williams' 27,300-mile pipeline network stretches from coast to coast with
access to every major supply basin in the country. The gas pipeline unit's
Kern River Gas Transmission delivers Rocky Mountain and Canadian natural gas
to markets in California, Nevada, and Utah. The system has a design capacity
of 700 million cubic feet per day.

282,"Congratulations on the new car, Kari!

This is Jeff, of course, once again having to decline the Tuesday night dinner
invite. However, this month I am declining from a seat on United's flight 955
from London to San Fran. Isn't that special ;)?  Believe it or not, this is
relevant to you (all of you, not just Kari). That is because, as I was romping
around England trying to escape my everyday working life, I spent three days 
at
Porlock Vale on the West coast of the green isle riding some really nice 
horses.

I am especially sorry that I can not join the dinner to share my experience.

Now, I do recall some talk of taking a group holiday in England or Ireland in
2000. This is an unabashed attempt to persuade those interested in signing on 
to
a stay at the Porlock house. Some of you may have already heard this stuff 
from
Laura who was there a few years ago. The property is now owned by a bright and
professional couple (Helen & Kim) who were frequent guests until they succumb 
to
the dreamy idea that they could escape their hectic London existence for one 
of
country charm. From the return guests who were staying with me, the place 
hasn't
changed much since the change in ownership. No one seemed to miss the former
owners too terribly.

The house and grounds were immaculate. The original house and stables were 
built
in the 1930's for the hunt. It sits within the Exmoor National Forest, 
directly
on the coast. My room's view was of the paddocks that bordered the beach. 
Across
the Bristol channel, I could see South Wales - The local saying goes that, 'If
you can see South Wales, it is going to rain. If you can't see South Wales, it
is already raining'. I had my share of both - I could also see the village of
Porlock through the trees. The house is everything you might think of as the
stereotypical country English manner. Able to accommodate around 23 people, it
is full of dark wood, overstuffed chairs, a fireplace, antique furniture and
artwork. The common areas include three large sitting rooms, a dining room 
and a
well-stocked bar. The guest rooms each have their own private bath (The 
plumbing
works! Something that can not be taken for granted in England), Feather 
duvets,
extra pillows, lots of lace and a coffee/tea service. Phones and TV's are also
included for those who just can't stand it.

The property is about 20 acres. all of it well manicured. Flowering gardens
surround the house. In addition to the original stable, there are a number of
separate stalls, enough to house over 30 horses. Most of the land is in grass
paddocks that also contain the cross country fences/obstacles Any number of
courses could be set up with a tremendous variety of challenges and levels of
difficulty - The property has been the training facility for several Olympic
eventing teams. Also on the property are two indoor riding facilities, 
allowing
for all weather riding. One is larger than a competition dressage arena where
jumping classes are taught. The other is about one half the size of a dressage
arena and used for flat lessons. The footing seemed good in both.

As it sits with in the Exmoor National Forest, hacking in the woods is 
literally
across the road from the house's entrance. Actually, we rode through the local
village on several occasions to access the trails. It's not like there is a 
lot
of traffic to negotiate. The Exmoor is made up of rolling land that borders 
the
coast. We followed small roads and trails up heavily wooded ravines to the
windswept tops of the moors. When the weather allowed, we had fantastic views 
of
the ocean and the valleys with pastoral scenes of green farms dotted by sheep
herds. The hacks always included a wild gallop through the heather. Aside from
the grazing sheep, the moors are inhabited by wild ponies and red deer, both 
of
which I saw.

Back at the house, the guests are never lacking of energy due to poor 
nutrition
(they might be hung-over, but never hungry). You will find better food and 
wine
in San Francisco's restaurant scene, but the quality and variety of the 
Porlock
house is really quite good. Breakfast consisted of fruits and cereal followed 
by
a hot, traditional English fare. Dinner was a a white-linen, 4 course affair
featuring fresh salads, local game and fish and deserts that were, frankly,
obscene. They provide a good selection of wines as well. Casual dress is
appropriate, however, they do ask that you not wear your breeches to the 
table.
And, that's about as stuffy as it gets. For all the tradition in the house, 
the
owners and staff go out of their way to keep the mood lighthearted and jovial.
Unless you've fallen in with the wrong crowd, you are going to have a great
time.

Have I forgotten to mention the horses and instructors? Oh my. I am sorry to
have kept you in suspense ...

The horses were great! For us GGPS folks, they are by far better than anything
we've ridden lately. For you, ""Oh, but of course I have my own horse in Marin""
crowd, I don't think you will be disappointed. They are well-schooled,
well-cared-for and happy to work. They are Irish and English bred 
thoroughbreds
and warmbloods. I rode a couple of sensitive thoroughbred mares in flat 
lessons,
and an equine version of a Sherman tank on the trails. I didn't see it myself,
but apparently this guy was one heck of a jumper. With feet the size of dinner
plates, he must land with quite an earth-shaking thud. I mean, this guy was 
BIG!
My only concern about the horses was that (at least the three I rode) they all
seemed heavy in the hands. All the horses I saw wore running martingales. It
seems to be something common in the training there. Ok, ok, so I'm getting
picky.

The instructors, were also great. All the guests seemed happy with their
lessons. Of the two instructors I had, both were better than what we normally
see at GGPS (Will the Marin crowd please loose the smirks), and one was on par
with Lisa McCluskey. I was very pleased. It seems that the instructors talk
amongst themselves about the students. Several of us had the experience of
changing instructors who made comments about our previous lessons. All hacks 
are
led by someone from the stable (for the singers in the group, there is one 
girl
who has some ditty going most of the ride).

So my typical day was up at 7:00 to watch the sun rise (In December, it rises
all day and never quite gets anywhere) and take a walk. At 8:30, breakfast was
served. At 9:30, the first hack went out and the first lessons started. Lunch
could be had at the house or a short drive took us to a couple of small 
villages
where we would find the local pub. One has to remember that Guinness, while 
for
strength, is not for enhancing one's riding in the afternoon. The last lessons
begin at 3:30. Much to my pleasure, that left about 3 hours before dinner.
Plenty of time for a nap, maybe some reading, a hot bath and tea, and then
downstairs to sit by the fire and have cocktails with the other guests. Dinner
was served at 7:30, followed by coffee and after-dinner drinks, again, by the
fire. All-in-all, quite lovely. I am beginning to better understand the why 
the
English so cherish tradition. If you were wealthy, it was a damn fine 
tradition.

There is plenty for non-riders as well. The Exmoor National Forest is just as
accessible to hikers as it is to riders. At least two small villages are 
within
20 minutes walk. With a car, a lot of good touring could be done down the 
coast
towards lands end. If one is low on motivation, hanging around the house would
actually make for a fine day or two.

And so, I've already told them that I will be bringing a small contingent of
ex-colonists next summer. Helen suggested early June, as it is before the 
heavy
tourist season, but late enough that the cross-country courses should be dry 
for
good footing. They do not like to accept groups of more than 8 people, you 
will
need to bring a UK standard certified helmet for all but the flat work, and 
they
have a strict weight limit of 189 pounds (they do turn down guests in excess)
for riders.

Discuss amongst yourselves. I'm sure we could have a good time somewhere else,
but why risk it.

Jeff.

Power-Lines Deal
Davis, Edison come to terms but PG&E remains a balky holdout 
Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Saturday,?February 24, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/24/M
N184206.DTL 
Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday he had reached an agreement with Southern 
California Edison to put the state's financially ailing utilities back on 
their feet - but Pacific Gas and Electric Co., crucial to any deal, remained 
a holdout. 
The key to the deal is state purchase of utility transmission lines, which 
would help the companies pay off debt they piled up selling electricity for 
less than it cost them. Edison will part with its lines for $2.76 billion, 
Davis said. 
But PG&E is reluctant to sell, and the governor said no deal will work 
without PG&E. 
In addition to agreeing to sell its transmission lines, Edison said it would 
produce inexpensive power to sell to the state for the next 10 years. 
At a news conference in Los Angeles, Davis said the agreement in principle 
with Edison ""provides value to both sides. The utility gets the financial 
wherewithal to go back into business and keep our lights on. We get 
commensurate value in specific benefits, which provide us long-term power at 
very cheap rates."" 
Davis' framework for righting California's wobbly energy market, however, 
hinges on a similar agreement with PG&E. Those familiar with the talks 
involving the utility, based in San Francisco, said discussions are moving 
""very, very slowly."" 
""They are adamantly resistant to selling their transmission facilities,"" said 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek. 
Ron Low, a spokesman for PG&E, did not comment on Keeley's statement, but 
after talks concluded Thursday, Low said the two sides were ""very far apart"" 
on some issues. 
In a statement yesterday, PG&E Corporate Chairman Robert Glynn said the 
""discussions were an important milestone in the resolution of California's 
energy crisis."" 
""Each utility's issues and opportunities in this crisis are different, and we 
believe that PG&E has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer 
and shareholder interests,"" Glynn said. ""We are confident that continued 
discussions can achieve a resolution for our company."" 
Davis said he made ""good"" progress with Sempra Energy, the parent company of 
San Diego Gas & Electric, but only ""some"" progress with PG&E. 
Davis ruled out a deal that does not include PG&E. 
""I don't believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without acquiring 60 
percent of the transmission lines. That, in turn, requires us to have an 
arrangement with PG&E,"" he said. The other 40 percent of the grid is owned by 
municipal utilities. 
Keeley said Davis is right to insist that PG&E be part of any deal. 
""I think the deal announced is a good first step, and will hopefully put 
pressure on the other companies,"" Keeley said. 
CRITICS CALL DEAL BAILOUT
The purchase price set for Edison's transmission lines is 2.3 times the 
system's book value. Although critics argue that represents a bailout, 
supporters of the plan say the lines are worth far more than book value. 
For example, the cost to replace all the utilities' transmission lines -- a 
figure that probably would come into play during a possible bankruptcy -- is 
estimated at $20 billion. If the state pays 2.3 times the book value for all 
three utilities' systems, it will pay $7.2 billion total. 
The agreement with Edison follows a framework Davis announced last week. In 
exchange for the purchase of the lines, Edison also agreed to return $420 
million that the utility had sent to its parent company, establish 
conservation easements on 20,000 acres of watershed for 99 years and drop all 
litigation against the state demanding the ability to immediately raise 
rates. 
Edison also agreed to continue to sell the power it produces to the state at 
cost for another 10 years. 
Edison said it still believed that it would have won its lawsuit to recover 
costs through a rate increase. But Edison International Chairman John Bryson 
said, ""This agreement is far preferable to perhaps years of protracted 
litigation."" 
NO RATE INCREASE
Davis continued to insist that the deal would not require a rate increase, 
although he has indicated that the rate increase adopted by the state Public 
Utilities Commission last month -- which was supposed to last 90 days -- 
would stay in place. 
Davis has been under pressure to meet deadlines he has imposed himself for 
making progress in the energy crisis, which he said were designed to reassure 
Wall Street. However, he also had a personal stake in making yesterday's 
announcement, as he left immediately for a five-day trip to the East Coast. 
Davis will spend four days at the National Governors Association in 
Washington, D.C., and a concurrent meeting of the Democratic Governors 
Association, which he chairs. 
Much of his time will be spent reassuring his fellow governors that the 
crisis is under control, as well as meeting with President Bush and Energy 
Secretary Spencer Abraham. 
DAVIS ON 'MEET THE PRESS'
Davis also will use the time to make national media appearances, including 
one on ""Meet the Press"" tomorrow. Garry South, Davis' political strategist, 
said the appearances will allow Davis to address some East Coast media 
accounts of the energy crisis. 
""A lot of misconceptions and myths have crept in,"" South said. ""It's not 
helpful to California; it's not accurate on how the crisis came about and how 
we're trying to solve it."" 
After he leaves Washington, Davis will spend a day in New York to meet with 
Wall Street analysts. Yesterday, he suggested that he would be asking for 
their support in California's quest for revenue bonds to help pay for power 
purchases. 
California will have spent $2.8 billion on power by next month, and its 
credit ratings have been downgraded by some analysts. 
Consumer advocates reacted with skepticism to Davis' tentative deal with 
Edison. 
Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN, The Utility Reform Network, said she 
was displeased with the governor's plan because it commits ratepayers to 
paying off an unidentified portion of utility debt. 
""Nothing says what the final price tag is,"" she said. 
Dealing for Power 
-- Power lines: The state would buy Southern California Edison's transmission 
lines for about $2.7 billion, 2.3 times their estimated book value, to help 
bail out the financially strapped utility. 
-- Helping out: Edison parent Edison International would pay the utility 
about $420 million. 
-- Payback: Edison would drop its lawsuit seeking higher electricity rates 
and would to continue to sell the state cheap power for another 10 years. 
-- The other shoe: ''Some progress'' reported in talks over a similar deal 
with PG&E, which is reluctant to sell its lines.

Other Developments 
ENERGY FORECAST
California enjoyed its second straight day without a power alert. Lori 
O'Donley, spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator said 
continued warm weather around the West and completion of maintenance on some 
power plants that had been out of operation kept the state above the percent 
reserve mark. O'Donley said the state should remain out of the danger zone 
during the weekend. 
MORE MEGAWATTS COMING
Mirant Corp., announced that it signed a contract to provide 750 megawatts of 
power to the state during the month of March. ""We became more confident in 
our ability to enter such a contract after we received full payment from the 
Department of Water Resources for a bill due Feb. 20,"" said Randy Harrison, 
executive director of the company's western operations. 
INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR SETTLEMENT
Three generators reached a settlement with the California Independent System 
Operator to continue to supply emergency power to California until March 18 
even though it is unclear who will pay for much of that power. 
Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Cos. and Dynegy Inc. signed an agreement that 
effectively extended a U.S. District Court judge's temporary restraining 
order that had required the generators to supply power to the power grid 
operators. 
In the meantime, the three generators, along with Duke Energy Corp. and 
Mirant Corp., have asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for an 
emergency order forcing the Independent System Operator to provide a 
creditworthy buyer for their power. 
The federal commission on Feb. 14 told the system operator that it could not 
force generators to take on ""unacceptable financial risks"" by selling without 
a reasonable expectation of being paid. 
CONSERVATION REWARD
State Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, said he will propose legislation to give $1 
billion to customers who conserve on their electricity bills during the 
summer months. Perata claims that his bill, which would pay consumers a $10 
refund for every megawatt hour saved, would reduce the amount of money that 
the state would have to spend buying power on the expensive spot market.

Big 12 Roundup

Nebraska ran its home winning streak to 20 games and ended Oklahoma's string
of 20 straight victories Saturday in Lincoln.
Nebraska continues to lead the Northern Division with a perfect record, but
Oklahoma fell into a three-way tie with Texas and Texas A&M in the Big 12
South at 4-1.
The most important game this week has Texas A&M playing at Texas Tech. The
Red Raiders have been hard for the Aggies to handle in Lubbock in recent
years.

Buckman Picks Horns

Brad Buckman, a 6-9, 235-pound power forward from Austin Westlake who was
recruited by most of the nation's top programs, picked Texas Tuesday, saying
he thinks the Horns are on the verge of joining the national elite in
basketball.
He chose Texas over North Carolina at the end, but also had considered
Kentucky, UCLA, Missouri and others.
He had said earlier that the lure of the ACC, where basketball reigns
supreme, was very strong and almost pulled him to North Carolina.
But he told me Tuesday, ""I've always wanted to go to Texas. This is where my
heart is.""
He also said his head turned Texas' way at the end because coach Rick Barnes
has established a consistent winning program and has been wooing and winning
big-time recruits
""After looking at it closely,"" he said, ""I think Texas basketball is really
on the upswing. They've signed two McDonald's All Americans (freshman point
guard T. J. Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge and sophomore forward Brian
Boddicker of Duncanville) in the last two years.""
They could make it three in three years because Buckman's stock soared this
summer when he starred in several top AAU tournaments.
Brick Oettinger, publisher of Prep Stars Recruiter's Handbook, was asked who
was the biggest surprise of the summer.
Oettinger said, ""In terms of from out of nowhere - not in anybody's top 100
to everybody's top 25 - it would be Brad Buckman. Big forward, very
aggressive and a whole lot of skills - just about as many skills as . . .
anybody in the class. I've got him No. 21 now and he wasn't in my top 100.
Dave Telep, another national recruiting analyst, agreed Buckman is a national
top 25 recruit.
""The reality is that while there are 25 guys with larger names, there
probably aren't 25 better players in the class,"" Telep said. ""He is athletic,
can handle it some, he blocks shots, he shoots to medium-range and he scores
in the post.""
Clifton McNeely, the Westlake coach, also says his star's work ethic is off
the chart.
""He's a very gifted player with a lot of talent,"" McNeely said, ""but the best
thing about him is his strong heart and work ethic. I don't think you could
find anyone who works harder than he does."" McNeely also said he thinks
Buckman ""is the best player in Texas.""
There are some guards in the Dallas area who ranked higher nationally,
including Bracy Wright of The Colony, who chose Indiana, Daniel Horton of
Cedar Hill, who picked Michigan, and Bryan Hopkins of Dallas Lincoln, who
committed to SMU.
The Longhorns recruited all three of those star guards, but lost out on them
at the end.
Buckman averaged 20 points, 11 rebounds and 5 blocks for Westlake as a
junior. And he's the kind of blue-collar inside player Barnes loves.
McNeely said Buckman can play a power game inside and shoot from 3-point
range.
Asked to compare him to Luke Axtell and Chris Mihm, two other Westlake
players he coached who played at UT, he said, ""He has the physical presence
of Mihm and is a lot stronger coming out of high school, and he has the range
of Luke.""
He is the first recruit to commit to Texas for the early signing period next
month.
Barnes and his assistants are recruiting several other players, most of them
in other states, and hope to sign a  sharp shooting guard and a wing.
Buckman's  father, Brent, played on two national championship golf teams at
UT.

Basketball Team Has New Look

The Longhorn basketball team will have a new look this season with the
addition of heralded point guard T. J. Ford, who led Fort Bend Willowridge to
back-to-back Class 5A state titles.
When the season starts next month, Ford will be called upon to speed up the
Horns' offense and also create more opportunities for the team's inside
players with his lightning-quick passes.
Coach Rick Barnes is hoping Ford's creativity in the half-court offense will
improve the scoring punch of center James Thomas, who averaged 7 points and
6.5 rebounds a game last year.
Ford also should be able to provide better shooting opportunities for senior
forward Chris Owens, sophomore wings Brandon Mouton and Royal Ivey, and 6-9
forward Brian Boddicker.
Barnes had to operate without a true point guard last year. Fredie Williams,
Ivey and shooting guard Darren Kelly took turns at the point.
Barnes and the Horns coped with it admirably, going 25-9 overall and 12-4 in
the tough Big 12, but they shot only 41.2 percent from the field and had 88
more turnovers than assists. Ford should help raise the former and lower the
latter.
They also lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Temple, and
Barnes hopes Ford will be a key to helping the team get farther into the
playoffs this season.
Replacing departed wing Maurice Evans and Kelley, who combined for 30.8 of
UT's 70.5 per-game scoring average, creates scoring opportunities for other
shooters. Now Barnes just needs some of them to seize that opportunity.
He expects Mouton and Ivey to step up there. Sydmill Harris, a 6-6 freshman
from The Netherlands, has been a consistent shooter in pre-season workouts.
Owens was a star in the World University Games during the summer and is
expected to be one of the top players in the Big 12, and a more dependable
scoring threat.
""Ever since last year, the Temple game, it started coming together,"" Owens
said. ""It clicked. I didn't do what I wanted to do and I knew I had the
ability. Now I have the mental concentration.""

UT Women Looking Sharp

Coach Jody Conradt's Longhorn women's basketball team is picked to finish in
the middle of the Big 12 pack, but early practices and stiff competition at
several positons indicate it might be a lot better than that.
The Longhorns were looking good early last season before losing
center-forward Annissa Hastings and guardTai Dillard to knee injuries.
Hastings and Dillard are hale and hearty once again, but equally important is
the fact that the Horns' heralded recruiting class is living up to its  hype.
Stacy Stephens, a 6-1 sophomore, returns as the starting center, and 6-2
senior Tracy Cook and the 6-1 Hastings can back her up and also play power
forward.
Jody Bell, a 6-2 freshman from Canada, and 6-1 freshman Mercedes Williams
also are looking good at power forward.
Two freshmen - 6-3 Heather Schreiber, the high school player of the year in
Texas last year, and 6-2 Kala Bowers, last year's high school player of the
year in Oklahoma - are battling for the small forward job (it shows you are
on the right track when you can call 6-3 and 6-2 women small forwards).
Hastings is so versatile that she probably will see action at all three
inside positions.
Kenya Larkin returns as the point guard and other guards who will see a lot
of action include sophomore Kaira White, who has been looking great in
practice, plus Dillard and freshman CoCo Reed.
Alisha Sare and Asha Hill are other guards who could figure into the rotation.
RECRUITING NOTES: LaToya Davis, 6-2, of Houston South Houston, picked Texas
Tech over Texas last week. Nichelle Roberts, a 6-1 center-forward who teamED
with Mercedes Williams to lead Spring Westfield deep into the state playoffs
last year, is the only remaining uncommitted blue chipper and the Longhorns
have a great chance to sign her.

No. 10 Horns Win Soccer Title

The No. 10 Texas women's soccer team clinched its first Big 12 Conference
title Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Oklahoma.
The Longhorns are 11-3 overall and 9-0 in the Big 12 and have one regular
season match remaining against Texas A&M.
Coach Chris Petrucelli, in his third year at the helm, said, ""This is a huge
step for us. It's going to help us in recruiting. It's going to help us in
marketing. And it's going to help our confidence.""
Freshman forward Kelly Wilson scored Texas' third goal Sunday, giving her 11
for the season and tying her with Carol Finch for the season record. Finch
set the record in 1996.
Lerrin Biggers scored Texas' first goal and Kylee Wosnuk got the second one.

Next Issue November 5

The next issue will be e-mailed on November 5,  and will cover the Baylor
game and preview the last home game of the season against Kansas
I'll also have a lot of recruiting news, including my updated list of the top
prospects.
I'll also have reports on other Longhorn sports teams.

because the Alford B compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance.
This compressor will be out of commission for the month of March.  The

established and should be available by March 5th or 6th.  At this point in
time, we will take the HPL Fuels Cotton Valley redelivery gas to zero and
balance the redeliveries between the two points.  Therefore, DEFS will not
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for Eastrans.  After
the new TXU Lone Star redelivery point is put into place and the points are

intent to close the merger.  Tim's best intelligence is that a June 1 closing 
date is the best they can hope for and it may be late June or later.  Also,  
until the deal actually closes, there is always a small chance it could come 
undone.  If we get Gallup in service May 1, we have a 1 month or greater bust 
between our in service date and the date the cheap electric rate kicks in.  
Has Courtney got this covered?  I suspect he's been thrashing around so much 
on locking in the swap that it hasn't been on his radar screen.  

I think we should formally notify ECS that we expect them to negotiate a 
favorable interim power deal to cover the gap between our in service date and 
the merger closing.  (the difference between the $.038 and .067 rate was 
about $200,000/ month as I recall, so this is worth some real $$$)  Also, we 
ought to remind Courtney that he is still obligated to find a better deal for 
us if the merger goes south for some reason.  I drafted a letter  awhile back 
that could be updated for this purpose.  Susan, assuming Steve and company

I just wanted to give you a heads up on this, since it will in the future 
have an impact on your groups.  We are in the process of working with IT to 
develop several enhancements to unify that will enable us to at first obtain 
the reports to more accurately book various types of deals such as storage 
and agency deals.   The second phase will be to automate unify so that the 
recording of the deals can move directly from unify to SAP.  The end goal is 
to have unify and the GL as close as possible mirror what is in sitara and 
the P&L, thus minimizing UAF and OA exposure.  

One of the items that is to be addressed during these enhancements is to have 
the desk associated with each of the deals in unify.  This will allow us to 
split pipelines across desks for end reporting uses just as we do in the 
P&L.  We are also hoping to move to a process where we will be settling on 
all of our desk to desk deals through the actualization process which will 
reduce the UAF exposure.  How this will impact your groups is that once we 
move to this phase, we will need to have all desk to desk deals be assigned a 
meter and pathed as a buy/sell so that these deals will flow into unify.  

I know that this will cause additional work on your end, so I wanted to give 
you at least some forewarning that this topic would be coming up over the 
next few  months  and as much preparation time as possible.  Please feel free 
to let me know of any concerns or ideas that you might have.  As I said 
before, we are only just now beginning talks with IT to develop these 
enhancements, so I would foresee that this will not be an issue for a month 
or two.

USA: Enron shares in stay in doldrums after downgrade.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. 
Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.
Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. 
Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. 
Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. 
Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's.
By Jonathan Stempel

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. 
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. 
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. 
""Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. ""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year."" 
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a ""lagging"" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. 
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. 
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. 
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or ""junk""-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. 
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. 
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,"" he said. ""That is a positive for credit quality."" 
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

USA: Enron shares drop despite further triage attempts.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995.
Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
Enron shares sank 50 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $15 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. ((David Howard Sinkman, New York Newsdesk 646-223-6094)).

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a new move to shore up investor confidence after it tapped about $3 billion in credit last week, and to stop a plunge in the company's stock that set new six-year lows. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.
Enron shares crashed through a psychological barrier of $15 a share, shedding $1.66, or 10.65 percent, to $13.85 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than half of its value in the past two weeks, losing more than $14 billion in market capitalization. 
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston. 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
""Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits,"" said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead it's an act of desperation.""

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a ""death spiral"" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. 
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. 
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. 
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. 
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. 
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or ""shareholders' equity,"" by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. 
Long-Running Concerns 

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. 
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. 
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. 
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. 
""Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story,"" Wasden said. 
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. 
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. 
""We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company,"" Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. ""This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point."" 
Keeping Talent A Challenge 

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. 
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. 
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. 
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. 
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for ""personal reasons."" When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."" 
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? 
""I don't know anybody who said that,"" Wasden said. ""What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?"" 
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. 
""Enron has been a cult, more than a company,"" he said. ""Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside."" 
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. 
""There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants,"" he said. 
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.

 ",Edie,,
431,"Below is an update on the Adaytum Consolidated Model:

1) BU Basic Cubes' Training => last week (10/22 - 10/26), two training sessions were held - EEOS and EGAS. Provided in the training sessions were User Documentation, which included screen prints of Manager screens, as well as a word document with additional user instructions and screen shots of the data cubes. Also included were the Adaytum excel add-in reports (both summary and financial statements). Additional training sessions are scheduled for the next two weeks. If you have not done so already, please let me know your availability. The sessions lasts approximately 4 hours, and is done ""on-site"".

NOTE: Most Enron computers have a minimum of 128K of RAM. In order for faster processing of data and accessing the cubes, we are recommending that everyone upgrade to an additional 128K of RAM (totalling 256K RAM). The cost of this upgrade is a nominal amount (under $25), and is well worth the investment.

To check the amount of memory on your machine, please do the following commands:

Start | Settings | Control Panel | System (Look under Computer for the amount of RAM you have).

2) Next Adaytum User Group Meeting => we will not have a meeting this week due to accounting close. However, I will schedule a meeting for next week (time and place to be determined). Potential topics for discussion are: (a) 2002 Plan information input into Adaytum (timeline), (b) Training update, and (c) Integration of actual / plan data between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse. Please forward to me any additional topic you may want to discuss.

Please call me if you have any comments or other items to discuss.

451,"Attached are my first notes on Tennessee pipeline.  RUTH, you need to read these notes and render and opinion <== that's an accounting term.

Of course all rules are made to be broken but here are some ideas

1.  Put the notes in a word document and save it with the following naming scheme
		Notes_(pipeline name).doc 

		Example ==>  Notes_Tennessee.doc

2.  Save the document under the pipeline directory, 
		o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/Transportation/(pipeline name)/Notes_(pipeline name).doc

		Example ==>  o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/Transportation/Tennessee/Notes_Tennessee.doc

	Since we are just starting the process on most of the pipelines, we will need to create new directories for most of the pipelines.

3.  At a minimum, put the date you are making the notes, I don't think the time is so important.  I put in the time when its conversation, I just put in the date when I spend a couple hours working on something.  Ha - me work a couple of hours!!

4.  Put your initials at the end of the note so we know who made it.

5.  When you put someone's name in the document, put their phone number and tell us who it is, at least the first time you mention their name if that person is not someone we all deal with.  usually this would be the person your are speaking with at the pipeline.  First person that comes to me and says ""buy me a pop"" gets $.60.

6.  Last and certainly optional, I like to use the Comic Sans MF font because its more pleasing to the eye than the Times or Romans stuff but feel free to do your own thing.

I am requesting that we reconvene a meeting as soon as possible to discuss the Dominion Transmission issues. I am getting phone calls, faxes, and e-mails almost daily from affected producers. We need to reach consensus on handling these urgent requests.

Several of our (former) producers are being required by Dominion to provide a signoff from Enron North America concerning our termination of their contracts and/or the release of the producers' gas back to the producer so that the producer can sell it elsewhere.  They are under a deadline to get these termination letters forwarded to Dominion immediately or their gas will remain unallocated and they will not get paid for January 2002 gas in March 2002 (as is normal).  

Producers currently requesting such termination letters include:
Pentex Energy Inc
Pacific Atlantics Resources
Gas Marketing Inc
Megan Oil & Gas
Triad Energy of West Virginia
Virco, Inc

In addition, the following producers are also requesting termination documents via an e-mail from potential buyer

October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again 
for the winter months.  I could see you guys buying incremental third party 
gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints.

Example:  You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your 
transport to get it to a citygate.  ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel 
and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.  We should let you know what 
the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on 
the worksheet.

So if we had this tab for October, it would just have 2 deals on it so far.

500,"Hi Cliff,
Attached is a memo from Doak Bishop analyzing Enron's claims under our 
political risk insurance for expropriation of TGS resulting from the stamp 
tax.  We are asserting in our suit against Argentina, that the tax assessment 
is an expropriation prior to payment because it affects our equity in the 
company.  In other words, any attempt to dispose of the asset would require 
disclosure of this massive assessment which significantly impairs the value.  
Doak and I met with our expert in international law, Professor Michael 
Reisman of Yale who believes and will testify that this is a valid claim.  
Therefore under the policy, we arguably have an immediate claim for 
expropriation against OPIC, even though we haven't paid any money. To avoid 
waiving any claims, we will prepare a letter to OPIC requesting a tolling 
agreement, so we do not have to file a claim or arbitration against it within 
the period required under the policy, pending resolution of the matter.  
Given the nature of our call with them this morning, I'm sure they will 
cooperate.

I will arrange a call with Guido Tawil, our local counsel in Argentina to 
review the PPI issue, and we will analyze the commercial policy to see if we 
can find any coverage there.
Kind regards,
Michelle

The ETS Operations Administration and P&SM organization will support all of 
the objectives listed below in whatever manner we can. but I feel that we can 
be most directly involved with the last one:

9).  E-Commerce Strategy

 We can work with the GSS organization to develop an E-Commerce Strategy and 
proceed with implementation.   Some specific areas that we need more 
development and implmentation of is the use of :

 ""Payment on Receipts""  this eliminates the further processing of vendor 
invoices related to approved purchase orders.

 SAP Auto generated Purchase Orders.  - When we have designated NPA 
agreements in place for specific commodities, let the system convert the 
requisition to a purchase order and route to our preferred Supplier.

 Use of reverse EDI - allows vendors to input verbal orders to them into 
their Purchasing System and reverse create a ""Purchase Order"" into our SAP 
System.

 An E-Commerce system that can be implemented  anywhere within the Enron 
world that provides for a quick seamless transaction from ""Cradle to Grave"" - 
Requisition to Payment"".

 Our implementation of an ""Integrated Supplier"" is allowing us test ground 
for many of these applications with an outside Supplier partner.

Low Interest Energy Loans
Approved for Three Agencies



Sacramento - The California Energy Commission has approved low-interest State loans of almost $2.6 million for energy efficiency projects in the East Bay Municipal Utility District, the Los Angeles Community College District and Humboldt County. 

East Bay MUD, based in Oakland, will receive over $1.9 million in funds to install 12 60-kilowatt natural-gas fired microturbines at its Administration Center and a 30-kW photovoltaic (PV) system on the roof of its Operations Center. 

The microturbines will trim the district's energy costs by over $431,000, based on new Pacific Gas and Electric rate schedule. The planned PV project has obtained a 50 percent PG&E rebate and will further reduce energy bills by $7500 a year. The projects will trim the district's on-peak and mid-peak energy use by 35 percent. 

Simple payback period for the microturbine project is 5.6 years and 9 years for the PV system. 

The LA Community College District has requested a loan for over $436,000 to install a 140-kW PV system at its East Los Angeles College. The college has recently made lighting and comfort system improvements but would like to produce renewable energy to reduce energy costs by about $48,000 annually. Reduced energy bills will enable the District to pay back the loan in nine years. 

Humboldt officials will use about $130,000 in loans to improve heating and make lighting retrofits at the County courthouse and other buildings. Once done, the improvements will enable the county to reduce energy costs by at least $23,000 yearly. At the same time, the county will be able to reduce electrical consumption by 37 kilowatts. Savings from the projects alone will enable the county to repay the loan way ahead of the required 11-year payback period. 

The loans were made under the Energy Conservation Assistance Act. To encourage energy efficiency, the act grants energy loans at a low 3 percent interest rate for local governments, schools from K-12, special districts, public and private care facilities, community college districts and other agencies.

    Yesterday, Jim Templeton and I met with Mike Stites (sp?) at Conoco.  He
had very interesting ideas about when standards should be introduced to a
market, and noted his view that the power market was not ready yet for
standards -- either retail or wholesale.  I also spoke this week to Bill
Benham, who supports a broader scope for GISB with the provisos that gas
issues not become minimized, and that segments retain balance.  It looks like
the producers could be split in a vote to broaden GISB's scope.

    Veronica is working with your office to set up a conference call with
Alex DeBoissiere regarding the recent EEI Board meeting.  We should have some
material prepared prior to your meeting that might help.

and FERC industry meetings.  Hopefully, with their participation they may
support a combined gas & electric standards organization.

541,"Almost one month ago, Special Agent Carl Wake of the FBI called me about the 
Steve Todoroff investigation.  He indicated that the FBI had recently learned 
of the article about EOTT's NGL theft that appeared in the business section 
of the Houston Chronicle.  Mr. Wake said it might be a matter the FBI would 
like to investigate.  I told Mr. Wake that EOTT was currently working with 
the Harris County District Attorney on the prosecution of this matter, and I 
thanked him for the FBI's interest.  He told me that the FBI might want to 
work with the Harris County District Attorney in investigating this matter, 
and he stated that there may be investigative information that the FBI can 
obtain more quickly than the Harris County District Attorney.  Mr. Wake 
requested a copy of the materials we had provided to the Harris County 
District Attorney.

In order to avoid damage to the good rapport we have established with 
Assistant District Attorney Bill Moore, I asked John DeGeeter to call Bill 
Moore and advise him of the contact that had been made by the FBI.  Bill 
Moore agreed to call Carl Wake and work with Mr. Wake on his request for the 
materials provided by EOTT.

Carl Wake called me again yesterday.  He has been working with Bill Moore.  
Mr. Wake stated it was too early to speculate as to what charges would be 
brought.  He did say that our materials clearly indicated federal wire fraud 
and possibly mail fraud.  He said that where there is wire fraud, there is 
usually money laundering. 

The purpose of Mr. Wake's call yesterday was to inquire about the status of 
some interview summaries that John DeGeeter and I have prepared and collected 
at the request of Bill Moore.  Mr. Wake requested that EOTT send a copy of 
the summaries to him when we sent the summaries to Bill Moore.  Those 
summaries were sent out today.

I gathered from my calls with Carl Wake that the FBI is very interested in 
taking an active part in this investigation.  In order to build on the 
relationship we have established with Bill Moore, we will continue to direct 
our inquires about the investigation to Mr. Moore until he tells us to do 
otherwise.","Carl Wake Steve Todoroff Wake Wake

575,"Fred, as a follow-up to our telephone conversation, we would like to launch 
some new products on EnronOnline -- swaps on coffee, sugar and cocoa (the 
agricultural ""softs"").  We would like to know if Canadian law presents any 
sort of restrictions or other issues with respect to financially settled 
derivatives on these commodities.  We would like an analysis with respect to 
both swaps and options (however, if timing becomes an issue, we should 
concentrate on swaps, as our offering of swaps is more imminent).

We are looking at rolling out with nine products -- for each of the three 
commodities, there will be a calendar-month swap tied to (i) the New York 
Board of Trade price, (ii) the LIFFE price, and (iii) the spread between the 
two exchange prices.

We would like the results of your analysis by April 27.  Please feel free to 
call me with any comments or questions you may have.  Thank you for your

576,"I have attached hereto a copy of our memorandum dated September 20, 1999 
which had previously been provided to Mark Taylor setting forth our analysis 
of Canadian (Alberta/Ontario) legal/regulatory issues concerning the entering 
into of commodity based OTC products by Enron with counterparties on line 
through what was then Enron's proposed internet based trading system.  The 
proposed extension of that system to coffee, sugar and cocoa swaps/options 
does not present any unique issues under Alberta or Ontario laws.

Note that in reviewing the Septermber 20, 1999 memorandum, the Proposed Rule 
of the Ontario Securities Commission on OTC derivatives (which was not in 
effect as at the time of that memorandum) was eventually not implemented; 
accordingly, that part of the discussion regarding the Proposed Rule can be 
ignored.  Moreover, I understand that Ontario has, subsequent to the date of 
that memorandum, adopted the Uniform Electronic Commerce Act published by the 
Uniform Law Conference of Canada  which is based on the United Nations Model 
Law on Electronic Commerice and which, in short, gives legal efficacy to 
electronic documents and contracts.  Alberta has not yet adopted such 
legislation.

I trust this is satisfactory for your purposes.  Please contact me should you 
require anything further.  Regards.

579,"I was informed late last week that EOL is looking to me to determine whether 
U.S. counterparties should be permitted to trade European power products via 
EOL.  According to Edmund Cooper and Tana Jones, the London office is 
deciding whether European counterparties should be permitted to trade U.S. 
power products via EOL.  I believe that this allocation of counterparty 
review responsibility (with regard to power products) should be reversed.  
The legal team for U.S. power is in the best position to determine whether a 
counterparty, domestic or European, has the requisite legal authority to 
trade U.S. power, and I believe that the London office is better positioned 
to determine whether a counterparty, U.S. or other, has the requisite 
authority to trade a European power product.

As we have discussed during the last week, a counterparty must have specific 
federal regulatory authorization in order to trade U.S. power.  I cannot 
identify any foreign counterparties from my lists of federally authorized 
entities and think it highly unlikely that a foreign counterparty will have 
the necessary authority to trade U.S. power.  Jim Fallon has expressly 
instructed me that in the event we do not currently trade U.S. power with a 
counterparty and cannot otherwise confirm that a specific counterparty 
possesses regulatory approval to trade power, a counterparty should NOT be 
permitted to trade U.S. power via EOL.  Accordingly, I return to my initial 
position that except for those foreign counterparties with whom we are 
currently trading over-the-counter (if any), all foreign counterparties 
should be granted read-only access to U.S. power products.  In the event a 
specific counterparty requests access to U.S. power trading, we can examine 
whether that specific party possesses the necessary authority to trade 
power.  

Edmund Cooper and Justin Boyd are reviewing whether a similar bar should 
apply to the trading of European power by U.S. counterparties, and I will 
defer to their judgment on that issue.

Please call me at *36121 with any questions or comments.

596,"Find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of 
credit support for MG and PaperCo.

My approach is as follows:

1.   Assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps.
2.   Spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors.
3.   Calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap (the 
default option)  using Black's formula.
4.   Treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows.  That is 
treat this value just like you would an annuity stream.  By discounting back 
this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk-reduced 
rate, I find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two 
NPV's.

Please give your comments, especially if this makes no sense to you.

formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination

No problem. I shall do it  this weekend.

Also, I left you a message regarding Grant Masson (a VP in my group
who left and went to work for El Paso 2 months ago).

I made a bet that he would be knocking on our door in a year. I lost. He 
wants to come back 
after 2 months.

My recommendation is to take him back. He left on good terms and is quite 
competent.
I would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other 
side
of the fence may look greener, but in reality it may be painted hay. ""The 
Return of Grant 
Masson"" would demonstrate that Enron offers best long-term growth 
opportunities (and that
I am good manager).

Grant would come back to his original  VP position. Can we short-circuit the
hiring procedures for a VP.  Grant's body is still warm and we can just 
re-instate
him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required 
to hire a VP.

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.

The audience consist of mostly first year graduate students in Industrial
Engineering and Operations Research some doctoral students and faculty. A
short introduction about opportunities for quantitative minded people at
Enron would be good. It would also be good if in your talk you can give some
technical examples for people with a good analytic background but no much of
a financial engineering background. Many of the first year graduate students
go for a masters degree and wonder what they can do with an OR masters
degree.

Note that the person mentioned in the text below (Ming Lung Lee) is very 
experienced in traditional traffic engineering work. He comes from MCI where 
he was responsible for modeling traffic etc.  It  appears that Sycamore 
finally got him.  One time they had lost him to Corvis (another optical 
equipment company), I guess Sycamore went back to him with a better deal!  As 
soon as this guy is available, I'll set up an all day technical meeting to 
hash out what needs to be done as far as optimization algorithm development 
is concerned.  I want to produce a technical requirement document to clearly 
outline what needs to be done to support dynamic, optical-switched-circuits 
based trading and streaming media applications, etc.  Having such an industry 
expert help us will help 'justify' internally all the the effort on the 
traffic analysis side that John Griebling has asked us to support.  Keep in 
mind that even though he is an expert in the field, the field that we need to 
play in has not develop yet. Even the emerging data based traffic (as opposed 
to voice where blocking of traffic is allowed) analysis is an order of 
magnitude more difficult (due to uncertain load), let alone trading such load 
(which we are planning to do!).

California Power Crisis in a Nutshell: David Wilson (Update1)

California Power Crisis in a Nutshell: David Wilson (Update1)

     (Adds dollar amount of Southern California Edison's last
default and references to bond insurers, Fitch and electricity
Board; updates federal response. Commentary. David Wilson is a
columnist for Bloomberg News. Opinions expressed are his own.)

     Princeton, New Jersey, Jan. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Californians
have suffered power blackouts. The state's two largest utilities
have defaulted on debt and failed to make power payments. State
and federal officials are working on solutions. The following
guide is designed to explain what, and who, is behind it all.

                             The Issue

     California's two largest utilities must pay more for power
than they can charge under a 1996 utility-deregulation law, which
froze rates until March 2002. They have racked up more than $11.5
billion in power-related debt. Out-of-state suppliers have balked
at selling electricity and natural gas to them because of concern
that they may not get paid.
     The price of power to California utilities more than
quadrupled during 2000 amid a surge in the cost of natural gas,
which more than half the power plants in the state burn. Natural
gas rose as much as 25-fold during December.

                           The Companies

     PG&E Corp. (ticker symbol PCG): Owner of Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., California's largest utility. Its shares have lost
55 percent during the past year, and it's one of only two stocks
in the Dow Jones Utilities Average to drop during that period.
     The unit's losses on power purchases totaled $6.6 billion at
the end of last year. On Wednesday, PG&E defaulted on $43 million
of commercial paper and the utility unit defaulted on another $33
million. The unit has a $583 million power bill due on Feb. 1, and
another $2.12 billion is due by March 2.
     Edison International (EIX): Owner of Southern California
Edison Co., the state's second-largest utility. Its stock price
has fallen 67 percent in the last 12 months, making it the worst
performer among the Dow utility stocks.
     Power-buying losses at the unit totaled $4.5 billion as of
Dec. 31. The utility defaulted Tuesday on $230 million of bonds
and failed to make $366 million of payments for power. Yesterday
it defaulted on $32 million of commercial paper. Another $378
million of power payments are due this month.
     Power suppliers: Include Calpine Corp. (CPN), Duke Energy
Corp. (DUK), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Enron Corp. (ENE), Reliant Energy
Inc. (REI), Sempra Energy (SRE), the Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
unit of Southern Co. (SO) and Williams Cos. (WMB).
     Natural-gas suppliers: Include Coastal Corp. (CGP), Duke
Energy, the J. Aron & Co. unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
Sempra Energy and Western Resources Inc. (WR).

                          The Financiers

     Banks: Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) arranged a total of $4.2 billion in loans. They refused
Wednesday to let PG&E and Pacific Gas & Electric borrow part of a
$1 billion credit line, leading to the commercial-paper default.
     Ace Ltd. (ACL): Bermuda-based insurance company. A unit has
about $14 million of reinsurance on the two utilities' bonds and
about $125 million in debt assumed in credit-default swaps, which
protect bondholders against defaults. ``Ace believes that any loss
would be substantially less,'' it said in a statement.
     Bond insurers: MBIA Inc. (MBI), the largest U.S. bond
insurer, guaranteed more than $1 billion of Edison's and PG&E's
bonds. Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABK) said its exposure totals
about $150 million. Smaller amounts are at risk for Financial
Security Assurance Co. and Financial Guaranty Insurance Co.

                        The Rating Services

     Standard & Poor's: Said Dec. 13 that it might cut ``A''
ratings on the parent companies and ``A+'' ratings on the units.
Downgraded them to ``BBB-,'' its lowest investment-grade rating,
on Jan. 4. Lowered them to ``CC'' on Tuesday except for Southern
California Edison, cut to ``D'' because of its default. S&P may
also reduce ratings even more.
     Moody's Investors Service: Said Dec. 11 that it may lower
``A3'' ratings on PG&E and Edison, along with ``A2'' ratings on
their utility units. Downgraded them all to ``Baa3,'' its lowest
investment-grade rating, on Jan. 5. Lowered ratings on the parent
companies to ``Caa3'' and their units to ``Caa2'' earlier this
week. All may be cut further.
     Fitch IBCA: Said Nov. 7 that it might cut ``A'' and ``A+''
ratings on senior unsecured debt of Edison and its utility unit.
and its ``A'' rating on Pacific Gas & Electric's first mortgage
bonds. Downgraded Edison and its unit to ``A-'' on Dec. 11, to
``CCC'' on Jan. 4, and to ``CC'' on Tuesday. Cut the mortgage
bonds to ``A-'' on Dec. 11 and to ``B-'' on Jan. 4.

                           The Agencies

     California Department of Water Resources: Administers the
state's water systems. Started buying power on behalf of the two
utilities in January. Can spend as much as $400 million on power
under a bill passed yesterday.
     California Independent System Operator: Owns the system that
delivers three-quarters of the state's electricity. Imposes power
emergencies as needed.
     California Power Exchange: Buys power for utilities.
Suspended the two utilities' trading privileges after Southern
California Edison failed to make a $215 million payment and PG&E
failed to meet a new requirement that it post collateral.
     California Electricity Oversight Board: Five-member state
panel that governs both the Independent System Operator and the
Power Exchange.
     California Public Utilities Commission: Regulates utilities.
Granted rate increases averaging 10 percent to the two utilities
on Jan. 4. The increases are effective for 90 days. PG&E and
Edison wanted 26 percent and 30 percent, respectively.
     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission: U.S. agency that
oversees utilities. Issued rules Dec. 15 that freed California
utilities from a requirement to buy power through the exchange.
Has rejected proposals for caps on the power prices they pay.

                          The Background

     Power supplies are so tight that California can have an
emergency even if only a few plants go off line for repairs or
malfunction. Even ocean swells can result in production cuts, as
they can clog plants' coolant intakes with sea kelp.
     About two-thirds of California's power plants are more than
30 years old. The last major plant was built more than a decade
ago, before the state toughened its emissions standards. Demand,
especially from companies making products such as computers and
semiconductors, has grown along with the state's economy.

                          The Emergencies

     Stage One: Power reserves for hydroelectric plants fall to
within 5 percent of demand, and reserves for all other types of
plants fall to within 7 percent of demand.
     Stage Two: Power reserves from all types of plants fall to
within 5 percent of demand.
     Stage Three: Power reserves fall to within 1.5 percent of
demand. Can lead to rolling blackouts in parts of the state. The
first alert of this type happened on Dec. 7; the first blackouts
happened Wednesday.

                        The State Response

     Davis declared a state of emergency Wednesday, freeing the
Department of Water Resources to spend money in its budget and the
state's general fund to buy power on the utilities' behalf.
California's legislature then approved $400 million in outlays.
     Legislators are working on a bill, proposed by Davis, that
would let the state buy as much as $3.5 billion of power a year
under multiyear contracts and sell it to utilities at cost. The
plan sets a price of $55 a megawatt hour, below the utilities'
average selling price of $72 after the rate increase. Davis has
held talks with power generators about the length and price of
contracts; he hasn't reached any agreements yet.
     Additionally, legislators have discussed allowing Pacific Gas
& Electric and Southern California Edison to refinance the power-
purchase debt by selling bonds.

                       The Federal Response

     Energy Secretary Bill Richardson issued an order Dec. 14 that
required power suppliers to sell electricity in California. The
order was extended Jan. 11 and Wednesday, and is scheduled to
expire next Tuesday. Richardson, who leaves office tomorrow with
President Bill Clinton, signed a similar order for natural-gas
suppliers that Davis had requested.

                            The Outcome

     Very much in doubt. Duke Energy, Dynegy, Reliant Energy and
Southern Energy were prepared to force the two utilities to file
for bankruptcy before the emergency spending bill was set into
motion, Davis said.

I am very happy to inform you that I just received a call from Salvador 
Beltran. (Salvador is a lawyer who earned an LL.M. at Harvard when I was 
earning mine at B.U. we know each other since 1988)

Salvador is a PAN Member of Congress that is finishing his term, nevertheless 
he is part of the close advisory team for Mr. Fox.  Salvador let me know that 
one of the priority subjects discussed between Mr. Fox and President Zedillo 
was electricity reform and this subject is on tops agenda.

Just yesterday Mr. Fox designated his economic policy advisory team and 
Salvador is part of it.  He told me that in their first meeting with the 
elected president they discussed electric reform as one of the main subjects, 
he also let me know that he might be put in charge of the task force in 
charge of working out the details of the reform.  

I offered 100% of my time to the effort and told him that I was available 
everyday at any hour until this comes to fruition.  He invited me to 
participate in the effort and told me that in the next 10 days he would 
contact me in order to start  working.  I offered him the full support of 
Enron in this effort.

He agreed with me that there is going to be an important window of 
opportunity in the Congressional sessions that will take place from September 
to December of this year and that we have to work hard in order to present a 
proposal that is agreed upon by all of the political actors.

Next Friday, July 14th, I am having a meeting with Geronimo Gutierrez who 
heads the PAN think tank in Congress.  I worked together with Geronimo last 
year when I helped them draft their counterproposal to the President's 
initiative.  I will offer him to work with him on this subject.

invitations.  We discussed several backup options in anticipation that the 
new Administration might be difficult to enlist as speakers.  So far we have 
invited Powell, Rumsfeld, O'Neill, Ashcroft, Whitman, and Abraham, having 
previously been turned down by the congressional leaders.  Phil and I decided 
we should in light of the tight time left before the meeting, extend 
invitations to Greenspan and Larry Lindsey.  I also have a long list of third 
tier invites, many of whom come from the media.  Lora Sullivan and I will be 
making numerous follow up calls this week to the cabinet invitees.  Early 
next week I anticipate that we will need to start reaching out to 
nongovernment types, such as the media.  I will let you know.  We may also 
decide early next week to extend invites to a few interesting congressional 
committee leaders, such as Bill Thomas.  

2.  I had several meetings on the Hill Friday with Jeff Skilling.  He was 
very good, although he may have been a little taken back with my unabashed 
coaching at the start of the day.  If you get any feedback on his impression 
of the Hill meetings or the inauguration, I'd love to know how we can do 
things differently and better.  We met with Dick Armey, Don Nickles, Rob 
Portman, and Charlie Stenholm.  Of particular note, contrary to what he has 
always told Ken, namely that he would not get active on behalf of a company 
in Tom Delay's area, Dick Armey was very interested in what Jeff had to say 
and promised to spend personal time getting up to speed on electric 
restructuring and would assign a staff person to work the issue.  Jeff 
attended and thoroughly networked all of the Enron inaugural events, 
including our private dinner Saturday night with Reps. Blunt and Barton.  
Jeff was our star Enron attraction, given that Ken was sick and did not 
attend the dinner.   At the conclusion of our activities yesterday, I 
suggested to Jeff that he spend a day in DC every quarter or perhaps three 
times a year.  He seemed to like the idea, but stressed the importance of 
getting this travel on his calendar well in advance.  Ideally, we might marry 
this up with his trips to New York.  We could perhaps structure an evening 
dinner in DC coupled with a one-half day schedule with the 
Executive/congressional branches.  Jeff could then spend the rest of the day 
in NY.   Regardless of the time allotted, we can structure worthwhile time 
for Jeff in DC.  This will both raise and strengthen his profile.  Also I 
will be forwarding shortly notes from Jeff to the Members with whom he met.  

3.  I met with Rep. Culberson last Thursday.  As I Emailed earlier, he wants 
to start a campaign for Ken as NASA chair.  I owe Culberson a response on 
this.  I thought I would run into to Ken at one of Enron's inaugural events.  
I did not.  So I need to bug you for an answer on this.  Do you want me to 
kill this idea?   Also per Culberson's request, we have scheduled a one-half 
day tour for the Congressman in our office for Feb. 23.  

4.  Our inaugural events were extremely well attended and I think quite 
successful.  If you hear anything differently from any of our executives, I 
would be pleased to track down any problems. 

5.  Should I now follow up with Ken's office on the best way to be involved 
in Ken's DC efforts?  I am glad to do so, but I do not want to overstep.

AEP to Divide Its Assets Between Two New Companies (Update1)
Bloomberg, 10/31/00


JAPAN: UPDATE 1-Enron says priority in Japan is electricity market.

10/31/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Enron Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay 
said on Tuesday the Houston-based company's near-term priority in Japan was 
the electricity supply market, which is undergoing deregulation. 
""One of our highest priorities...in the next two or three years is 
electricity,"" Lay told a news conference.
Last year, Enron established its first Japanese venture, E Power, to try to 
break into Japan's electricity market that since March has allowed 
non-utility firms to supply power to large-lot industrial and commercial 
users. 
Japanese media have reported that Enron, North America's leading buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, plans to build a coal-fired power 
plant in Fukuoka prefecture on the southern main island of Kyushu. 
Asked whether Enron planned to buy or build a power plant in Japan, Lay said 
the company believed there was surplus capacity in Japan on which it hoped to 
draw. 
""Our belief is, if anything, today there probably is surplus capacity both of 
generation and transmission capacity,"" Lay said. 
""It's not a matter that we are reluctant to buy or build assets,"" he said. 
""If the market has surplus capacity, there's not much reason to do that, at 
least initially."" 
Enron also unveiled on Tuesday a package offering eligible electricity users 
three-to five-year electricity contracts that it says will reduce their 
electricity bills by up to 10 percent for the first year, with the 
possibility of further reductions for the remaining years of the contract. 
Several other foreign energy firms have also shown an interest in entering 
the Japanese market. 
These include U.S. oil major Texaco Inc , Vivendi SA and the Royal 
Dutch/Shell Group . 
None has started actually supplying electricity to large-lot consumers in 
Japan, however. Enron set up a second subsidiary in May, Enron Japan Corp, 
with the aim of seeking business opportunities other than electricity supply 
in Japan, mainly through EnronOnline. 
The Web-based EnronOnline trading system had, as of October 11, executed more 
than 350,000 transactions with a gross value of $183 billion on the system 
since it was launched in late 1999. 
Enron uses the online system to make markets in commodities such as pulp and 
paper, petrochemicals, metals and broadband capacity, in addition to gas and 
power.

Enron's Japan Unit To Offer ""Elec Discount Pdt"" Nov

10/31/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE), the Houston-based energy and 
communications giant, said Tuesday its wholly-owned subsidiary Enron Japan 
Corp. will offer effective Nov. 1 an ""electricity discount product"" targeting 
Japan's high-volume large-lot power users, numbering 8,000. 
Joseph Hirl, Enron Japan's president and chief executive officer, told 
reporters that his company is ""already working with a number of entities"" to 
discuss power supply contracts.
Enron's package, which will typically run three to five years, will allow 
customers to ""immediately"" cut up to 10% in their current electricity costs 
for the first year of the contracts, with the possibility of further 
reduction for the following years. 
In the first full year of the contract, Enron will pay a financial rebate of 
up to 10% to a customer on a kilowatt-hour basis, under the customers' 
existing power supply contracts with other power suppliers. 
Enron will pay a rebate in the first year but will not actually supply 
electricity. 
From the second year onward, Enron will supply actual electricity to the 
customer at agreed fixed prices. 
Under the government's partial deregulation implemented March 21, high-volume 
large-lot retail electricity consumers - which represent roughly 27% of 
Japan's total power demand - can now freely choose their power suppliers. 
Enron declined to elaborate on how it plans to secure electricity necessary 
for fulfilling the proposed contracts. 
Enron Corp.'s chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay, who was speaking at the same 
press conference, said the company's highest priority in the Japanese market

Next comes trading in metals, weather derivatives and pulp and paper, Lay 
said. 

In addition to those main focus areas, Enron Japan's Hirl said there is 
""tremendous potential"" in areas such as liquefied natural gas, coal and 
foreign exchange trading. 
""We're looking to provide much services we can at the best price, and in many 
cases at lower prices, in most of the services we provide,"" Hirl said. 
Enron also plans to introduce broadband services in Japan. 
""For the next two to three years, establishing and extending our broadband 
network in Japan is a key part of our growth,"" said Kenneth Rice, chairman 
and CEO of Enron Broadband Services. 
Japan is a huge Internet market and it's also a logical foothold for Enron to 
extend its network into the rest of Asia, he said. 
By offering ""EnronOnline"" - the world's largest business-to-business 
electronic commerce platform, ""Enron can help the Japanese economy become 
more efficient by significantly reducing the costs of many products and 
services,"" Lay said.

Power companies say it so often, and with such certainty, that it has become 
a virtual mantra: ""Skyrocketing"" energy use by Californians is a root cause 
of the state's power crisis, and justification for surging electricity 
prices. 
But a computer analysis of electricity usage data by The Chronicle reveals 
that the mantra is a myth -- that overall growth in electricity demand hasn't 
been nearly as great as the industry portrays it. 
The industry has painted the summer of 2000 as the equivalent of a 100-year 
storm in meteorology -- an event so powerful and unexpected that the existing 
infrastructure was devastated by its force. 
The statistics show that 2000, taken in total, was nothing of the sort. 
Moreover, two independent state agencies' assessments of California's power 
plant capacity appear to show that the growth should have been easily 
accommodated. 
The companies have defended their practice of increasingly taking power- 
generation plants out of service by arguing that heavy demand and consequent 
plant usage necessitated major, time-consuming repairs. 
""The claims that demand growth is rampant and that it was totally unexpected 
and due to the Internet economy, to Silicon Valley, or server farms, 
or people recharging cell phones -- that's bogus,"" said Tom Kelly, assistant 
executive director of the California Energy Commission. ""About as bogus as 
you can get."" 
The Chronicle's findings are based on data collected by the California 
Independent System Operator, a manager of the state's electricity grid. They 
show: 
-- Total electricity consumption in California increased only 4.75 percent in 
2000 from 1999, a sharp contrast to claims of industry representatives, who 
have repeatedly relied on isolated, loose or selective comparisons that make 
growth appear as high as 20 percent. In fact, the single greatest hour of 
electricity usage in 2000 was actually lower than any peak demand period in 
1999 or 1998. 
-- Average peak demand -- the average of the highest hour of electricity 
usage for each day -- increased only 4.79 percent from 1999 to 2000. Even 
during the months of May to September in 2000, when the greatest spikes in 
electricity usage occur, demand growth was only 8.31 percent higher than the 
same period the year before. 
-- More than 30 days of critical power shortage warnings, so-called Stage 3 
emergencies, and two days of blackouts this year occurred at times of 
moderate energy use -- levels often below those at which neither warnings nor 
blackouts have occurred in the past. 
The findings appear to buttress suspicions that the ""skyrocketing demand"" 
explanation for rising energy prices is a cover for what is really happening 
-- 
that power companies have simply started charging more for an essential 
commodity, regardless of whether it is in short supply. 
Presented with The Chronicle's findings, Gary Ackerman, a representative for 
the Western Power Trading Forum, a trade group representing power companies, 
said the calculations support the industry position that electricity demand 
is growing strong. 
""That's pretty healthy growth for California as opposed to the long-term 
historical average, which is close to 2 percent,"" he said. ""To me, that's 
really strong growth."" 
Energy demand is certainly on the rise in California -- growth of more than 4 
percent is still double what was projected -- and the state has obviously 
fallen behind in building power plants. 
Even though a recent study found California ranked 47th out of the 50 states 
in per-capita energy consumption, the surging demand explanation has become 
so accepted that leading officials accept it as gospel. Gov. Gray Davis has 
made energy conservation -- 10 percent, at that -- a centerpiece of his 
efforts to solve the crisis. 
""Energy use is growing,"" said state Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, citing 
the growth of Silicon Valley and high-tech operations statewide. ""There's 
been tremendous growth, whether manufacturing or high tech -- cell phones, 
faxes, whatever. The stuff is growing."" 
Yet the energy industry has been steadfast in its insistence that the 
consumer is largely to blame. In testimony and submissions to government 
bodies considering prescriptions for the crisis, energy demand growth has 
consistently been overstated. 
Joe Bob Perkins, the chief operating officer of Houston-based Reliant Energy 
Inc., told the U.S. Senate in January that California's growing economy and 
high summer temperatures caused electricity use to ""surge dramatically"" -- a 
demand growth of 13 percent. 
Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, said Perkins' testimony was based 
on estimates by the federal Energy Information Administration of monthly 
retail electricity sales. 
""We do stand by that,"" Wheatley said. ""Unfortunately, it does not track with 
ISO data."" 
The industry-backed Edison Electric Institute said in a report that 
electricity demand grew by anywhere from 5 percent to 21 percent during the 
spring of 2000, compared with the same period a year earlier. 
Russell Tucker, an economist for the institute, said the group's figures were 
derived by identifying the single highest hour of electricity demand for each 
spring month of 1999 and 2000 and comparing them, finding the May peak rose 
21 percent. 
Granted, the state Energy Commission uses the same model to determine whether 
California has enough plant capacity to meet demand. But the presentation 
makes it appear that overall demand, not just the absolute peak, is growing 
by 21 percent. When the peak of each day is averaged and compared from year 
to year, May's figure was much lower: 12.79 percent. 
Also, nowhere did Edison's report note that the peak hour of 2000, a load of 
43,784 megawatts on Aug. 16, was actually lower than the peak hours of either 
of the previous two years -- 45,884 on July 12, 1999, or 44,406 on Sept. 
1, 1998. 
The Chronicle analysis of average peak demand showed that no month last year 
grew more than June's 15.34 percent, though no blackouts occurred in that 
month. May and June were the only months when demand growth exceeded 10 
percent, the analysis showed. Most months recorded 4 percent or 5 percent, 
and some -- such as September -- were less than 3 percent. 
Two months, October and December, had demand levels lower than the year 
before -- 4.22 percent less for October, 1.46 percent lower for December. 
Mike Florio, a consumer lawyer and board member of the ISO, said that even 
growth of less than 5 percent from 1999 to 2000 would seem overstated, since 
1999 was a relatively mild weather year and 2000 was a much hotter one. ""You 
are quite right,"" Florio said. "" 'Skyrocketing' demand is a myth."" 
MARKET MANIPULATION?
Consumer representatives and some politicians have long suspected that, 
rather than dire imbalances between supply and demand, market manipulation is 
behind the crisis. 
Generators and power marketers adamantly deny this, saying they have done 
everything they could to keep the lights on. They say they ran aging, 
decrepit plants at higher-than-normal levels last summer to accommodate what 
they described as unprecedented demand. They also say that, at great expense, 
they delayed much-needed maintenance in order to keep the power flowing. 
Their claims have received some support from the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, which said in a report last month that it found no evidence power 
companies were using maintenance schedules to manipulate supply. The report, 
however, was heavily qualified by the FERC, which said it did not investigate 
other forms of manipulation. Moreover, the agency acknowledged that the bulk 
of its investigation was conducted by simply calling power plants and 
questioning them over the telephone. 
The supply side of the energy equation is harder to penetrate, in part 
because supply data are confidential. Thus, the question of how blackouts 
could have occurred at such low levels of demand in January is hard to 
answer. What is clear is that, at times, during the crisis this year, as much 
as 12, 000 megawatts of electricity supply have been unavailable for use, 
mostly because of unplanned plant outages -- about four times the level 
anticipated by the ISO. 
Power companies say the old plants they bought were not capable of producing 
to the levels sketched out by the ISO and the Energy Commission, and that 
everything from low water conditions, emissions limitations and high 
temperatures last year caused less energy to be available than was 
anticipated. 
But others suggest that what began as a shortage caused by a withholding of 
supply to drive up price has turned into one caused by withholdings out of 
fear of not being paid. 
What did go up, unquestionably, were wholesale electricity prices. 
While average electricity usage during the heaviest hours last year increased 
by less than 5 percent, prices charged by power companies to the utilities 
that deliver juice to consumers increased more than 289 percent. 
In June, the cost of a megawatt hour increased more than fivefold, going from 
the 1999 level of $30.53 to $170.60. In October, prices doubled over the same 
period a year earlier, going from $53.47 to $111.04. And in December -- 
despite a 1.46 percent decline in electricity usage from the previous 
December -- peak wholesale electricity prices hit $425.59. They'd been $31.88 
one year before. 
Then the pace of price increases began to accelerate within the last six 
months of 2000. Overall, average peak usage during December was about 31,200 
megawatts, about a fifth lower than it was in August. Average prices in 
December? They just about doubled, to $425 a megawatt hour. 
The companies' explanation for rising prices despite falling demand was that 
more and more plants had to be taken offline for repairs, decreasing supply. 
Even given the high number of inoperable plants, questions remain about why 
the existing supply could not cover demand. 
On the blackout days of Jan. 17 and 18 fewer plants were offline -- and more 
electricity was available -- than on days when the state managed to squeeze 
by without turning out the lights. 
Even today, with Stage 3 alerts having faded away, at least temporarily, 
demand levels remain more or less the same as when California was in a 
constant state of emergency. Moreover, the lists of offline plants are as 
long as ever. 
AMPLE POWER SHOULD EXIST
The Energy Commission and the ISO have concluded that California's power 
plants are capable of generating more than 45,000 megawatts of electricity. 
That means that even with plant repair outages, low water levels decreasing 
hydraulic generation, air-pollution rules and other environmental 
constraints, the power companies should be able to accommodate all but the 
most extreme spikes in demand. 
According to industry data obtained by The Chronicle, the Western Systems 
Coordinating Council, a government-backed trade group in Salt Lake City, 
concluded California would have considerable surpluses throughout 2000, 
including margins as high as 39 percent in December, based on data provided 
to it by the ISO. Even under low water conditions, the ISO reported, the 
state would have total power resources of 47,532 megawatts in that month. Yet 
unplanned outages were far higher, and the system began to crash that month 
and into this year, at far lower levels of demand. 
""Clearly,"" Florio said, ""we should not be having a shortage at 2 a.m. on 
Christmas Eve, when the only person awake is Santa Claus.""

See highlited section of story below.  PG&E's got it right.  Recall that DWR 
was only buying power that it determined was ""priced reasonably.""  
Consequently, the net short wasn't getting picked up.  That meant that the 
ISO would have to go to the real-time market to close the gap.  The ISO would 
then charge the utilities for the power purchased.  Recall that Bob Glynn 
referenced the $300 MM/month that continued to pile up on PG&E's balance

Now that PG&E's in bankruptcy, the state is now responsible for the full net

The inside story of why PG&E went bankrupt: Top officials of the huge utility 
say they didn't think Sacramento could fix their problem.


(Published April 22, 2001) 

On April 13, a week after Pacific Gas & Electric filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection, Gordon R. Smith, president and chief executive officer 
of the utility, and Dan Richard, vice president for public affairs, met with 
The Bee's editorial board. What follows are edited excerpts from the 
interview: 
Bee: Why don't we start with a single-word question -- why? 
Gordon Smith: Why did we file Chapter 11 [bankruptcy] a week ago today? In 
all sincerity, it was the right venue for trying to resolve the financial 
energy crisis facing our company. It's a means to get somewhere else from 
where we were before or where we are now. 
There have been a lot of statements over the last 10 months now that we've 
been looking for a bailout. I think even the [Southern California] Edison 
agreement reached with the governor has been viewed by some as a bailout. We 
never viewed it as a bailout. 
What we really wanted was the state Public Utilities Commission to follow the 
law to determine the end of the rate freeze, to give a valuation of our hydro 
[electric] facilities and after that, pass on the costs of wholesale power 
costs to our customers. It's not our power costs. It's our customers' power 
costs. 
And, in fact, the PUC in the last several weeks and months has been issuing 
destabilizing orders to us. You probably saw two and a half weeks ago that 
they announced a 3-cent kilowatt-hour increase, which is described as 
somewhere between a 40 and 47 percent rate increase. None of that money in 
fact stopped with financially troubled PG&E. It went right onto the state. 
In fact, as we read their orders, there was even more than that coming out of 
our treasury to go to the state. That, along with a few other orders, just 
said we needed to take a look at a different venue. Chapter 11 appeared to be 
the best one. 
Dan Richard: I think we really did lose faith that there was going to be a 
solution coming out of the political process. And I have to tell you, people 
in Sacramento were saying to me, ""We don't believe there's the political will 
to fix this problem."" It was kind of startling. But there were a number of 
leaders who were saying, ""We don't think you're going to get there."" And we 
didn't think we were going to get there. 
Bee: What is your evaluation of the Edison deal? 
Smith: Well, I think our press release said we're delighted. We're happy to 
see that they've reached a conclusion. We're still evaluating it to see what 
is in it and what isn't in it, and whether or not it might be a framework for 
a settlement. 
Bee: The conventional wisdom I'm hearing is that Edison pretty much got 
everything that it wanted. A lot of people were asking if that deal was on 
the table a week before, why would PG&E not have taken it? 
Smith: I don't think that deal -- and I'm speculating here so forgive me -- 
was on the table the week before for Edison. 
Bee: How about for you? 
Smith: I would speculate that our actions last Friday spurred people to work 
around the clock over the weekend and for an announcement on Monday. 
Richard: I think the governor actually said almost those very words. 
Bee: You think he gave them a better deal to prevent them from going to 
bankruptcy? 
Smith: Absolutely. Yeah. 
Bee: What's not to like about that proposal from a utility point of view? 
Smith: We were prepared to accept many of the terms that the governor 
outlined in his televised speech a week ago last night. There were things 
that we wanted to have in that agreement that never appeared to show up in a 
written agreement. 
Bee: What was PG&E's comfort level with selling either its transmission or 
its hydro to the state? 
Smith: Well, it's a Sophie's choice for us. Part of the company was based on 
our hydro system and our transmission system. In order to stem off where we 
ended up, we were willing to put those on the table. 
Bee: From your perspective, did it make more sense for the state to be in the 
ownership business of the hydro or the transmission. 
Smith: Not really. 
Richard: Is there a third choice? 
Smith: They give us a dollar, and we give them back their IOU, and not a hot 
dog? 
It was a currency that obviously the state is interested in, and Edison is 
willing to agree to. As Dan indicated, we were willing to make a Sophie's 
choice and put it on the table. But in return, we needed some things as well 
to take the transaction forward that we didn't have, nor do I believe Edison 
had a week ago today. 
Bee: You mentioned the guarantee that wouldn't end up with another 
under-collection was one of the things you wanted, and couldn't get. What 
else? 
Smith: You say guarantee. I guess it might be characterized like that in some 
fronts. We have been forced by the state of California, either the Public 
Utilities Commission or the Legislature, depending how you look at it, to be 
out of the generation business. The public policy of the early or middle '90s 
was to get the utilities out of the vertically integrated business. 
All right. We sold power plants. The ones that we held had a reduced return 
in equity on them. What we really want is some assurances for what we 
purchase will be passed through. No business can stay in business if it can't 
pass on the wholesale costs. 
Bee: What else did you need? 
Smith: For a deal with the state? 
Bee: Yes. 
Smith: I'm really not in a great position to speculate on all the gives and 
gets on that. But we wanted, as Dan indicated, a transaction that would be 
enduring. We wanted guidelines. We wanted assurances that when we gave up 
billions of dollars, there would, in fact, be a transaction.... 
Bee: So is it possible that you could look at the Edison deal, decide that 
it's wonderful and you wished they had offered it to you, and have it applied 
through bankruptcy? 
Richard: As part of our reorganization plan. 
Bee: Meanwhile, the Legislature could reject it for Edison and you guys could 
get it and they'd be out in the cold. 
Smith: Write that down. (Laughter.) 
Smith: It may very well be a solution. But as Dan indicated, our 
reorganization plan, at the end of the day, has to have a comprehensive 
solution for paying power costs going forward as well as recovering the power 
costs in the past. 
Bee: You've had a week now to pick it over. Have you seen anything in that 
deal that is off-putting to you, a deal-breaker? 
Richard: You'll have to excuse us if we decline to comment on that. If we did 
comment on that, it would look like we were either trying to push it through 
or push against it in some way. The governor and Edison are going to present 
that deal to the Legislature, and the Legislature is going to view it and I 
think what we're trying to say is we're not closing doors to anything. We're 
just in this venue and this venue doesn't foreclose any possibilities. 
Smith: Chapter 11 is not an end to itself. We would like to get out of it as 
soon as practical. 
Bee: Can I ask about the gas side? When you hear from people they talk about 
""energy"" prices. They don't mean electricity. They mean the gas bill. Why did 
gas prices run up so much higher in California than they did elsewhere? What 
if anything do we need to do to keep that from happening again? 
Richard: I think we have two answers to that. One, there is more gas demand 
for the obvious reasons. People are converting power plants to gas or are 
building gas-fired plants only because it is the fuel of choice from an 
air-quality standpoint. The increased demand for gas by electric generation 
is something like 700 million cubic feet a day, and this is out of 5 billion 
cubic feet of day that we use. There's been a huge run-up in the pull on the 
natural gas system. 
We have infrastructure needs on natural gas. Just like we need to build new 
power plants in the state, we need to have new interstate gas transportation 
lines built. 
Smith: There's a restriction on both the capacity of the pipe and the 
commodity itself that has led to the increase. 
Richard: But nationwide, there is not a natural gas shortage. But it is just 
more in demand. So prices have come up. 
Now having said all of that, that there are some fundamentals that would 
drive the price of gas up, we don't believe that those explain how high the 
price of gas has gone. And there, when you can buy price at the Henry Hub, at 
the Texas/Louisiana border for $5, and it costs $1 to transport it to the 
California border, why is it selling at the City Gate (L.A.) for $20? 
Smith: And Southern California Gas Company pays right now, I believe, about 
50 percent more for natural gas than we do, because we have Canadian gas 
sources. So there's something going on in the transportation capacity of the 
Southwest. There's just now question about it. 
Richard: And the FERC is looking at this, and we've joined with others in 
saying there may be some, something wrong in the marketplace that needs to be 
examined there. 
Bee: Whose job is it to solve this transportation problem out of the 
Southwest? 
Smith: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The complaints are before them. 
Bee: Could I ask a question about the rolling blackouts that we'll likely 
have, and whose lights should go off? The city of Los Angeles, as we know, 
has its own public power agency, and it's also in its own control area. They 
most likely will have enough power to survive every summer day and likely the 
lights will never go off in the city of Los Angeles this summer. 
Sacramento has its own public power agency, and most likely SMUD has bought 
enough power to survive every summer day. 
Richard: But they're part of a - 
Bee: But they're part of PG&E. 
Smith: They're part of a control area. 
Bee: And PG&E likely does not have enough power to survive every summer day 
because the state, most likely, will not be able to find enough power on the 
open market. PG&E wants to turn around and shut off the lights in Sacramento 
and have Sacramento share in these rolling blackouts. Why should Sacramento 
share in these rolling blackouts when we've bought enough power to survive 
these days? 
Smith: Because SMUD has a contract with PG&E that provides for that to occur 
in return for lower transmission rates. 
Bee: But weren't these interconnection agreements essentially designed to 
deal with malfunctions and acts of God as opposed to acts of politics? 
Smith: It was designed to occur when there was not enough power. Period. 
Richard: I don't think that PG&E wants to pursue a beggar-thy-neighbor 
strategy. We're subject to ISO rules and the existing rules and arrangements 
and contracts in place. It's not quite PG&E saying we've decided that SMUD 
should suffer. This is sort of similar to the other problem. 
We've got a set of contracts and agreements in place. People don't like the 
outcome and they want to change it. I'm not saying they're wrong to want to 
do that. Those were the institutional arrangements that were put in place. 
Bee: But you're saying that SMUD cannot make the policy choice to say that 
we're going to have reliable power this summer and we're willing to increase 
our rates to do it. And then they can't get the power delivered because PG&E 
is not essentially in the same situation. You're not allowing SMUD to make 
that choice. 
Richard: Well, I think that's probably a little more personal than I'm 
comfortable with. I don't think Gordon and I made that choice. Or PG&E made 
that choice. And I don't know enough about the contract. 
Bee: But didn't SMUD make the choice to buy enough power for this summer? 
Smith: I assume so. I met with Jan Schori [SMUD general manager] yesterday. 
And she assured me that she had enough power for the summer. 
Bee: So why shouldn't we - 
Smith: Let me get back down to it. We have a contract with SMUD that in 
return for lower tariff transmission rates, because they're part of a control 
area, when there is a shortage of supply in the control area they're 
dispatched off and share in the outages that the other 14 million 
Californians will be sharing in. 
Bee: To get back to the Edison MOU [memorandum of understanding] and your 
bankruptcy for a minute. As you read that MOU and you look at the start of 
your bankruptcy proceeding, what do you see in bankruptcy that is better for 
you than what is in that MOU? 
Richard: Again, that causes us to speculate on the MOU. But we went through 
the door because we needed to and we chose to. And we're now there. And as 
Gordon said, our goal now is to move through Chapter 11 as quickly and as 
efficiently as possible. If there are elements of the Edison MOU that are 
appropriate for a reorganization plan, then that gives us a head start. 
Now that we are in bankruptcy, there are other parties that are at the table 
also. The creditors are there. And that includes some of the out-of-state 
generators and the QFs [alternative energy providers] and so forth. All of 
those people. It is actually probably a broader process. At the end of the 
day, it may turn out to be a more open process, in terms of forging a 
reorganization plan. 
So fundamentally, I don't think what happened is bad. If our bankruptcy 
triggered a breakthrough on an Edison agreement, which in turn can roll into 
a reorganization plan that we come up with, then maybe we'll all end up at 
the finish line faster than we would have gotten there, if, in fact, we would 
have gotten there at all. 
Bee: We all certainly would like to get to the finish line. We certainly

Northeast

FERC approves PJM conditionally as the RTO ""platform"" to be used to form one RTO in the northeast.  FERC rejects the New York and New England RTO proposals and directs the three ISOs and all interested parties to participate in a mediation led by a FERC Settlement Judge with assistance from outside consultants.  The purpose of the mediation proceeding is to facilitate the formation of a single RTO in the Northeast.  The mediation must begin within one week from today and must conclude 45 days thereafter.  The Judge must then submit a report to the Commission 10 days thereafter, which will include an outline of the proposal to create a single northeast RTO, milestones for the completion of intermediate steps, and a deadline for submitting a joint proposal.

While the Commission has not formally extended the RTO implementation date (currently December 15, 2001), Chairman Hebert made comments a couple of weeks ago and again today that perhaps the December 15, 2001 may have to slip some.  We will continue to monitor this issue.

Donna Fulton is sending separately a write up of similar action the Commission took with regard to the Southeast RTO effort.  

Please call me if you have any questions or comments.

about 8400 moves (out of a Houston employee base of 11000).  We have found at 
Enron that putting people next to eachother makes things happen: increased 
productivity and communication.  Given our tight office situation in Houston, 
moving people around to make room for new and expanding businesses has caused 
some disruption.  We try to keep it to a minimum and expect it to improve

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

WSJ(1/14)Heard On The Street:Enron Ex-CEO Made Bet Vs. Rival 		

01/13/2002
Dow Jones News Services
(Copyright ? 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)


  By Ken Brown 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

When Jeffrey Skilling resigned as chief executive of Enron Corp. in mid-August, he said he wanted to spend more time with his three children. ""I've missed too many soccer games over the years,"" he told his brother Tom soon after he quit. 

But instead of standing on the sidelines, Mr. Skilling stayed in the game, making a big, speculative stock-market bet against an Enron rival. 

A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling confirms that he made the wager: a short sale initiated on Aug. 24 against shares of AES Corp., a big energy producer. A person familiar with the matter puts the trade's value at $30 million, though Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the estimate is ""way out of the ballpark"" on the high side. 

The bet came as AES's shares were tumbling, and, depending on when it was closed out, could have netted him a profit of more than $15 million. Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman, Judy Leone, confirms he did make a profit on the trade but won't say how much or when the trade was closed out. ""There is a category of personal financial information that we're going to respect Mr. Skilling's privacy on,"" Ms. Leone says. 

As CEO of Enron, which made most of its money trading in the volatile energy markets, Mr. Skilling was used to taking on risk. He pushed the company into several unproven businesses, including the trading of bandwidth, or network capacity, a market that ultimately didn't prove successful for the Houston company. Enron itself reveled in a swashbuckling attitude that ultimately contributed to its downfall; the company has been under bankruptcy-court protection since early last month. 

But a bet of this type was exceptionally risky. In short sales, investors borrow shares of a stock and sell them, hoping the stock will fall so they can replace the shares with cheaper ones. Such trades are riskier than buying a company's shares directly, because if the stock rises strongly, an investor with a short position on the shares can be forced to ""cover"" the bet at a sky-high cost. 

As it turns out, AES shares, along with those of other energy companies, fell steadily in the month after Mr. Skilling's resignation. Then on Sept. 26, AES stock tanked, falling by nearly 50%, when the company announced it wouldn't meet analysts' earnings estimates for 2001. If Mr. Skilling had maintained his short bet through that date, he could have earned better than 60% on his investment. 

AES, based in Arlington, Va., blamed the earnings shortfall in part on the fall in the Brazilian currency. AES wouldn't comment on Mr. Skilling's trading. ""Commenting on another company's now-departed executive's behavior is not a comment I think we ought to make,"" says Kenneth Woodcock, a company spokesman. 

Mr. Skilling's bet raises the question about whether he knew anything special about AES's business because of his work at Enron. Ms. Leone, his spokeswoman, says Mr. Skilling shorted the AES shares based on a July 30 page-one article in The Wall Street Journal that said AES was having trouble in its big Brazilian operations and would be hurt by the fall in the Brazilian currency. Based on information in the article and his general knowledge about how business in Brazil worked, he felt that the company's stock might fall in price. His trading decision was ""absolutely not"" based on any nonpublic information he had obtained while an Enron executive, she says. 

AES did trade energy with Enron, but only a small amount and only as a way to sell its output, rather than to earn a profit, according to Mr. Woodcock. He adds that there would be no obvious way for Mr. Skilling to have gained any unique or valuable knowledge about AES through Enron's dealings with his company. 

The trade was made through Mr. Skilling's account at Charles Schwab & Co., the big discount broker, and it created a buzz inside the firm's San Francisco offices. After the position was taken, ""we checked up on it a couple of days later, and a couple of days after that, and said, oh, it went down,"" says the person familiar with the trade. 

At the time of Mr. Skilling's resignation, Schwab executives in their newly opened private-client office in Houston were trying to sell Mr. Skilling on a plan to hedge the value of his Enron stock, the person says. Schwab executives in San Francisco had created an elaborate presentation for the hedging strategy, called a collar, but Mr. Skilling never acted on it, a decision that may have cost him millions, the person says. Mr. Skilling wouldn't comment on the collar proposal. 

At the time of his resignation on Aug. 14, the 1.1 million Enron shares that Mr. Skilling owned outright were worth about $47 million. He also had 500,000 vested options that were in the money, meaning their exercise price was below the stock's share price at the time. Mr. Skilling has said he sold about 500,000 of the shares he owned outright on Sept. 17, when the stock market reopened following the terrorist attacks. That sale would have netted him about $15 million, based on that day's volatile prices. 

His remaining 600,000 shares are worth $408,000 at Enron's current share price of 68 cents, and his options are worthless. Just accounting for the 600,000 shares he owns outright, the collar proposed by Schwab could have saved Mr. Skilling more than $30 million. 

Interestingly, professional investors often will try to hedge a big positive bet on a company in any given industry by shorting shares of a rival, on the theory that if the entire industry tumbles, the gains on the short sale would offset the losses on the long position. But Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the trade wasn't a hedge, adding that it was the ""first and only time"" he made a short sale and that right now the only stock Mr. Skilling owns is Enron. ""If he thought the stock price was going down he could have sold all his Enron shares; he didn't,"" Ms. Leone says. 

Enron and Schwab, which were often paired in magazine articles touting America's most innovative companies, had at least one minor business relationship. Schwab had handled a small portion of Enron's 401(k) called the ""brokerage window,"" which allowed employees to buy mutual funds not offered in the company's plan, as well as individual stocks for their 401(k)s. The relationship ended in July when Enron made some administrative changes to the plan and Schwab was replaced. 

Mr. Skilling isn't the only member of his family to suffer because of Enron's collapse. His brother Tom a Chicago television weatherman, bought 750 shares of Enron at $49 early last year ""because of these incredible analyst reviews"" of the company. He says he sold them in the fall at $27 to buy some land. ""Little did I know if I stuck with it I would have a 60-cent stock,"" he says in an interview from his vacation home in Alaska. 

He says his father suffered more: He bought 2,000 shares of Enron last year and still holds them. ""You wonder what in God's name were the analysts doing,"" Tom Skilling says. ""There were a lot of people lulled into, I don't know what, a comatose state.""

UNDER SPIRITUAL ATTACK

The Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall
away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons (1 Timothy 4:1).

A seminary student stopped by my office to tell me he was having
difficulty getting to school on time. What should have been a
five-minute drive lengthened to 45 minutes because a voice in his
mind kept telling him to turn at intersections. Not wanting to
disobey what he perceived to be the ""still, small voice of God,""
he was treated to a tour of the city almost every morning.

A pastor's wife, desperately needing the comfort of the Holy
Spirit and desiring His leading, passively believed that whatever
entered her mind was from God. She soon found herself bound by
fear and plagued by condemning thoughts.

These examples underscore the wisdom of John Wesley's words: ""Do
not hastily ascribe things to God. Do not easily suppose dreams,
voices, impressions, visions or revelations to be from God. They
may be from Him. They may be from nature. They may be from the
devil. Therefore, do not believe every spirit, but try the
spirits, whether they be from God"" (Martin Wells Knapp,
Impressions, Wheaton, IL: Tyndale House Publishers, 1984, p. 32).

In a survey of 1700 professing Christian teenagers, 70 percent
admitted to hearing voices, like there was a subconscious self
talking to them. I don't believe they are psychotic or paranoid
schizophrenic. There is a battle going on for their minds. I have
shared with many tormented people that they aren't going crazy
but are under spiritual attack. They usually respond, ""Praise the
Lord, someone understands."" It's freeing to know this truth,
because if there is a battle going on for our minds, we can win
that war.

Lord, today I choose to test the spirits and assume my
responsibility to think upon that which is true.

planning a media kick-off event to take place at the Holocaust Museum on 
November 20, 2000 at 10 a.m. The purpose of this event is to attract media 
attention and officially open registration for the race. If your schedule 
allows, we would like for you to speak at the kick-off again, as you did last 
year.

Mayor Brown, HISD Superintendent Rod Paige and Ed Allday, event chair for the 
Human Race, will also speak at the kick-off. The museum would like for each 
speaker to spend approximately five minutes talking about the importance of 
diversity in their respective environments. For example, the mayor will talk 
about diversity in the city of Houston, Rod Paige will speak to diversity in 
schools, Ed will talk about how the event highlights diversity, and you would 
be asked to talk about how Enron approaches diversity in the work-place.

If you are able to do this, Community Relations will draft your speaking 
points. We will call Rosie to check on your availability.

<3>	CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
_____________________________________________________________________

- THIS JUST IN FROM ONE OUR 575,000 USERS!

I just want to take a minute and tell you what a terrific
job you all are doing there at INO.com.

A while back I asked my broker if there was some way to get
current, Intraday price updates on their otherwise very
good on-line system. He said 'No'.  Then said, 'Wait a
minute- try INO.com, they can give you 10 and 30-minute
updates at no charge.'

Well, it's been an enlightening experience every day since.
While the Lee Gettess product didn't work out for me, the
John Crane Reversal Day product is proving very insightful
and was the catalyst for a few successful trades this week.

I look forward to my morning, evening and weekly extreme
market updates and I plan to shop at the INO store on many
occasions in the future to take advantage of the many
excellent educational opportunities there.

My 'Portfolio' and 'Quote Board' window allow me to draw a
much sharper bulls-eye and hit my upside targets with much
greater accuracy than in the past. I've been trading for a
few years now and have always enjoyed it, but you've injected
a new vitality and brought a new life to the markets for me.

Just yesterday, when exiting a long Bean position for a
modest but appreciated profit I thanked my broker for
turning me on to INO.com and I meant it.

You all are doing a bang-up job and I personally think a
lot of 'dotcom' start up outfits could do a lot worse than
to take a look at your approach and the way you cater to
your clientele.

Keep up the good work, it's greatly appreciated.

<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Andrew:

Commodity futures sank ahead of the three-day weekend,
led by sharp falls in Silver, Gold, Grains and Exotics.
Stocks failed to recover from a rough week after IBM
and Microsoft gave gloomy outlooks on Friday.  True to
form, the Dollar stayed firm though FX traders expect
a correction shortly.  The approaching Martin Luther
King, Jr. holiday curbed activity, but didn't prevent
widespread declines that reached to Coffee and Cocoa,
while Sugar and Cotton also faded.  In Grains & Oilseeds,
Corn fell on a Spark's seedings report, South American
weather pushed Soybeans lower, and Wheat ended near its
weekly lows.  Sharply lower lease rates affected Silver,
while fund selling weighed on Gold.  Copper was lackluster.
Crude Oil rebounded from declines on Thursday, but not
too convincingly.  Short-covering boosted Cattle.

Morning Watch List
This section contains 6 stocks that are expected move in 1 to 5 days. 
Click here for this morning's Watch List Stocks: http://www.realtimetraders.com/marketinfo/watchlist.asp Beyond The Numbers
Nasdaq drops below support
Tuesday technology stocks continued to trend lower as investors received 
more evidence a recovery in the tech sector may not occur as quickly as 
some analysts had been predicting. On the session the Nasdaq Composite 
lost 75 points and closed below the 2200 level at 2175. Dow Industrial was 
able to post a modest gain and remain above the 11,000 support level. After 
the close Sun Microsystems Inc. lowered their estimates and said demand 
continues to be weak. This morning two of the leading brokerages are making 
a lot of negative comments about the semiconductor stocks and some cautious 
comments on Juniper Networks and downgraded the stock. Given all the 
negative news in the market this morning, we expect the Nasdaq to continue 
to come under pressure and the Dow to break below the 11,000 level. As of 
this writing the Dow futures are lower by 46 points, and the Nasdaq futures 
are lower by 30 points. 
Stocks to Watch
After the close Alcatel (ALA) and Lucent Technologies (LU) announced their 
discussions concerning a possible merger of equals have been terminated. 
As a result both stocks rebounded slightly in after-hours trading, but this 
morning Alcatel is lowering its guidance.
As mentioned above, after the close Sun Microsystems (SUNW) warned it will 
not meet its previous estimates for the fourth quarter and lowered its revenue 
estimates to be between $3.8 billion and $4 billion. This figure is significantly 
lower than the $5 billion in the sameperiod last year and $4.1 billion in the third 
quarter of this year. The company went on to say US demand is worse than 
expected, and more importantly the company is starting to see weakness in 
both Europe and Asia.
Sector Analysis
Semiconductors remains under pressure
Readers may recall that since last Tuesday we have been warning the 
semiconductor sector will come under pressure as a result of the negative 
book to bill number.  The sector has lost 71 points or 10.1% since the 
book to bill number came in at a 10 year low. Now after 5 days of trading 
and a 10% decline all the major brokers have woken up and are cutting 
estimates on some of the leading semiconductor stocks. We find it amazing 
these so called analysts always make their call after the stocks have moved 
so much. Tuesday morning Morgan Stanley is cutting their estimates on 
Texas Instruments (TXN) and National Semiconductor (NSM). Dan Niles of 
Lehman Brothers is lowering his estimates on Cypress Semiconductor (CY) 
and Micron Technology (MU). Mr. Niles has lowered his 2001 estimates on 
Micron by 50% to 0.25 from 0.50 cents. 
Economic Reports & Bond Markets
Tuesday the long bond traded in a range and finished the session virtually 
unchanged. There are no major economic reports due out on Wednesday. 
Market Breadth 
Tuesday's NYSE advance/decline reading was 1409/1678 Vs. 
Friday's reading of1388/1632
Tuesday's Nasdaq advance/decline reading was 1362/2476 Vs.

768,"All of us are aware of the energy crisis confronting us, and the situation 
might get a lot worse this summer.  PGE has taken actions to reduce energy 
consumption, e.g., decreasing the amount of lighting within the building.  

In the spirit of energy conservation, Chris Calger and I are asking that you 
turn off your monitor(s) each day.  You do not need to log out of your 
computers to do this--simply press the monitor off button.  If you have any 
questions about how to turn off your monitor(s), check with Dave Steiner in 
our IT Department.

Thanks for your cooperation.",Chris Calger Dave Steiner,,

Two quick things...

First- from volume management:
When scheduling a service customer such as Harbor or WheelabratorShasta, 
Arco, Tosco, etc. we need to be sure to schedule using the customer ID in 
CAPS.  Otherwise RT has no generation and we are considered short (please see 
myself or Kourtney with questions).


Second- from the preschedulers:
If we sit at Lisa or Stacy's desk, please be sure to log out of the computer 
and their phone.   Their computers are not necessarily for Real-Time use,  
but I would like to be sure that we can continue to use these computers at 
night.  If they aren't happy with the cleanliness of their desk, or with 
having to reset their computers each morning, etc...we will probably lose 
this priviledge.

Other than that, 

Keep up the good work.

Thanks,
Bill",Kourtney Lisa Stacy,,Harbor WheelabratorShasta Tosco RT

Enron's Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes

As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning 
with the federal government's answer to California's be-deviled power market, 
free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price 
cap route espoused by the Cal-ISO. FERC's meeting is scheduled to start at 9 
AM EST. (Check http://intelligencepress.com this morning for updates) 

In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker yesterday, Enron CEO 
Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural 
problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers 
who have placed ""price cap 'band aids' over hemorrhaging wounds."" 

Lay told Hoecker the power market is ""halfway across a busy street in its 
transition from monopoly to competition. It can't stand where it is."" He said 
FERC has to make a choice between falling into the ""same trap of political 
expediency as California's ISO, leaving the nation's electric system in the 
lurch from one crisis to the next, [o]r it can take a big step toward 
fundamental structural reform."" 

At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) called on FERC 
to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the Cal-ISO from 
""unilaterally implementing"" any changes to its current $250/MWh price cap for 
wholesale electricity purchases. In a motion filed Monday, the marketer group 
specifically asked the Commission to bar the Cal-ISO board of directors from 
putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex 
load-differentiated price cap of $100 or less during the off-peak season 
effective Nov. 3. The plan was designed by the state's main utility consumer 
group (see Daily GPI, Oct. 30). In addition, the EPSA urged FERC to ""state 
explicitly"" that the Cal-ISO does not have the authority to impose or extend 
price or bid caps, unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission. 
The Cal-ISO's current authority to set price caps expires on Nov. 15. 

Lay said the Cal-ISO's complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of 
gas-fired generation, ""making obvious errors such as failing to take into 
account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in 
California; in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to 
sell their gas supply, rather than use it to make electricity in California."" 
The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc 
basis ""to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract 
sufficient supplies (which it inevitably will do),"" Lay said. In addition, 
the capped formula ""invites generators to shut in production, export power 
out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries."" 

He noted that the ISO's Chairman voted against the measure while all of the 
state's utilities voted for it ""presumably knowing full well that it simply 
will not work."" 

California is ""just the latest failure of partial or compromised open 
access,"" said Lay. ""It's time for the Commission to reject this approach.

795,"Note:  This interview with Jack Crawford of Alliance is probably the best 
information we have gained on the pipeline
operational start up and background information.  Vector may still be ""iffy"" 
for Dec. 1.  

Fingers Crossed, Alliance, Vector Shoot for Dec. 1
 
Alliance Pipeline informed its shippers yesterday that all debris has been 
cleared from the pipe, all connections are up and running, and that 
commercial service will begin on Dec. 1. Commercial service originally was 
expected to begin on Oct. 1 but was delayed several times because of 
commissioning problems . 

""We've tested all of our connections and we've been flowing volumes [to 
Midwestern LDCs] up to about half [663 MMcf/d] of what the pipeline is 
capable of transporting,"" said Alliance spokesman Jack Crawford. 

""We are asking our shippers today to provide forecasts to us of what they 
expect to do in the first month. The last time we did this the forecasts we 
got suggested that we'd be running at about 1.325 Bcf on the first day."" 

One of the key questions remaining is whether Alliance's main downstream 
supply outlet, the 270-mile Vector Pipeline project, will be ready to go as 
well on Dec. 1. Vector had construction problems because of wet weather and 
also was forced to delay its start-up from Nov. 1.  The pipeline would 
transport 700 MMcf/d of gas initially from Joliet, IL, through Indiana and 
Michigan to Dawn, ON, but would be expanded to 1 Bcf/d next November. 

""The last I heard they were expecting to make [the deadline],"" said Crawford. 
""We actually tested our meter with them over the weekend and it's all up and 
running, but that might be a subsequent event if they have a problem. It's 
been a challenge for them to get going, but it looks like they are all ready 
to go."" 

A Vector spokesman confirmed that commissioning is going smoothly and 
operations appear to be on schedule for Dec. 1 start-up. ""Right now everybody 
still feels that Dec. 1 is doable,"" he said. ""You might want to touch base 
again next week and see how it looks, but right now it looks like we're 
getting things pretty well wrapped up. 

""The last place where we've been completing work has been up in the Milford 
and Highland Townships in Oakland County, MI. That's the area just before we 
go in the portion of the pipeline that we're leasing from Michigan 
Consolidated Gas Co. As of last Friday, they still hadn't reached that area 
with linepack [gas]."" 

Crawford said the Aux Sable liquids plant also is up and running, and 
previous pipeline coordination difficulties have been ironed out. ""They are 
still bringing it up to full scale. They are short both volume and heat 
content at the moment and that's by design. The pipeline is flowing at about 
half volume at the moment, and in addition to that we've been running lean 
test gas."" 

Farther upstream, Alliance still has one lateral, the Peace River Lateral, 
that will be delayed because of the impact of wet summer weather on 
construction. ""It will be up and running perhaps not by Dec. 1 but in a week 
or two. It's an eight and 10-inch line. It's relatively small,"" he said. 

Once the massive new pipeline is running smoothly, the next steps to be taken 
include potential connections with several proposed pipelines in and around 
Chicago, including potentially the Guardian, Horizon and Whitecap Energy 
projects. 

""We also looked at a couple of other receipt connections on the upstream 
side,"" said Crawford. ""We've obviously talked about a potential expansion in 
the future, but as we found out by talking to people it looks like the supply 
additions in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin have not been as brisk as 
we might have thought, probably because of the downturn in the oil price a 
couple of years ago. It's likely that an expansion would be delayed for a 
year or two or even three. 

""The best that I've been able to ascertain from talking to people is that our 
supply deliverability really has not increased very much in the last two to 
three years, and as a consequence at least in the short run the gas on our 
system will end up coming out of other systems."" 

He also mentioned that TransCanada is planning to take some of its capacity 
out of service, including retiring some older compressors and rewheeling 
others, in order to reduce the amount of excess pipeline capacity in the 
Canadian gas market.

796,"FERC Approves Questar Pipeline

     The FERC has given final approval for a Questar $155 million
pipeline project to transport natural gas to southern California from
the Four Corners area at the borders of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and
Colorado. The ruling came after the commission was satisfied the
Questar Southern Trails Pipeline project would not harm the
environment. The project will consist of 693 miles of crude oil
pipeline that was bought by Questar in 1998 from Arco. The pipeline
will be converted for natural gas and several new compressors will be
built. The pipeline would be divided into a East Zone and a West
Zone. The East Zone will begin in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico
and end at the California border and carry up to 88 MMcf per day. The
West Zone is within California and has a capacity of 120 MMcf per
day.",,$155 million,FERC Questar Pipeline Arco MMcf
797,"Note:  Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB
TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions 
While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. 
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. 
Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. 
Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. 
TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. 
The pipeline has told the NEB that ""with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade."" Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that ""unconventional gas"" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in ""tight"" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas ""is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions."" At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. 
In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections, the pipeline says only that ""if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations, these sources may start contributing supply this decade."" 
In a separate toll case before the NEB, TransCanada predicts it will be 2008 before northern gas -- from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska -- begins to flow south. An announcement Jan. 14 by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp. suggested that TransCanada's educated guesswork is on the money. After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities, the group -- Imperial Oil, Conoco Canada, Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada -- declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage. Next comes the ""project definition phase,"" or $200-$250 million in technical, environmental, commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field, gas-gathering and pipeline facilities. 
Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in 2003. The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu, Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send 1.2-1.5 Bcf/d south to northwestern Alberta. The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanada's system. 
TransCanada is in step with the group's expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond 2003 to collect approvals and build the project. The pipeline company's forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually, going from a starting rate at 500 MMcf/d in 2008 to 900 MMcf/d in '09, 1.1 Bcf/d in 2010, 1.2 Bcf/d in 2011 and 1.4 Bcf/d by 2012. The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow, however. 
As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the 1970s for production from Prudhoe Bay. In the documents before the NEB, TransCanada says it ""recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics, timing, routing and scope. It's unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas.""

809,"Olympian Status for U.S. Gas Market 

Just so you'll know: ""The natural gas market is a real success story. ...FERC 
has gotten an enormous amount of things right. The market may not be 
unblemished, but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best 
market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across 
dozens of products. It's something everyone should be proud of,"" Robert Levin 
of the New York Mercantile Exchange told a FERC conference yesterday. 

""The natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of 
market conditions with hundreds, if not thousands of market participants, 
using an extraordinary selection of market instruments,"" Levin continued, 
adding that the Commission should be supporting the ""growth and increased 
sophistication of commerce. You're at that point now."" 

Warning against so-called solutions offered by some at the day-long 
conference to increase liquidity or tie the natural gas market to the 
electric market, Levin cautioned, ""liquidity cannot be legislated. Don't 
overreact. The electric market is poorly regulated. Remedies from the natural 
gas market should be transferred to the electric market, rather than allow 
the gas market to be corrupted by the regulatory mistakes of the electric 
market. 

""Rather than worry over regulating an hourly market for natural gas, change 
the electric market,"" which Levin believes has developed its over-emphasis on 
the hourly market because of the artificial tilt toward the spot market. 

But while Levin warned against too much market meddling, others among the 
more than 30 representatives of the industry and its customers testifying at 
FERC's conference on competitive natural gas markets argued for a variety of 
initiatives to increase market liquidity by changing the rules for pipeline 
transportation. 

Eliminating the shipper-must-have-title rule, promoting expansion of the 
existing pipeline infrastructure (especially in the Northeast), doing away 
with straight-fix-variable (SFV) rate design, review of firm-to-wellhead 
rates in the production region and the allocation of transportation costs 
between the upstream and downstream were among the chief proposals proffered 
by mostly pipeline customers. 

However, greater gas market liquidity shouldn't be confused with increased 
competition in pipeline transportation, municipals and producers told FERC 
staff during a post-Order 637 technical conference Wednesday. ""...[W]e're 
concerned the Commission may be equating market liquidity with competition in 
pipeline transportation. The two are not the same,"" said Arthur Corbin on 
behalf of the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents 
municipal gas distributors. 

""Even with greater and greater market liquidity, monopoly power exists in 
[the] pipeline transportation segment. Captive shippers will always require a 
regulated transportation service from any hub to their citygate,"" he said. 

Much the same holds true for LDCs, noted Bruce Henning, director of energy 
practices for Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc. (EEA), who represented 
the American Gas Association (AGA) at the Commission staff conference. He 
agreed market liquidity has improved immeasurably, but he added ""there's not 
a liquid market center at every pipeline receipt or delivery point location. 
Nor is there likely to be market centers in all of these locations in the 
near future..."" Consequently, Henning said FERC will need to continue to 
protect producers from market power that accompanies ""limited access"" to 
pipelines. 

The day-long conference held yesterday in Washington D.C. was the first of 
several that FERC staff plans to hold to explore the impact of the 
Commission's transportation policies on the development of gas markets. 

Christopher A. Helms, president and COO of Panhandle Pipeline Companies, 
urged FERC not to enact policy changes that would place commodity market 
liquidity as the ""ultimate goal"" at the expense of the transportation market. 
Helms said he advocated policies encouraging pipeline expansions and 
construction of ""optimal amounts of additional capacity"" to meet the needs of 
the market. ""The single most important characteristic for liquidity in the 
natural gas commodity markets is the availability of adequate transportation 
capacity."" 

Charles Daverio, vice president of KeySpan Corp., echoed that sentiment, 
saying FERC could increase liquidity in the New York City market and 
elsewhere in the Northeast by promoting construction of new pipeline capacity 
to ensure adequate supplies for the region year-round. This would reduce 
energy costs and enhance reliability, he noted. 

Panhandle's Helms also cautioned against policy changes that would force the 
development of new market centers and hubs. Market centers should be allowed 
to develop at their ""own pace,"" and at locations where the market ""sees fit,"" 
he said. 

EEA's Henning estimated more than 40 ""liquid and transparent"" market centers 
exist today, which permit industry participants to buy and sell gas daily 
under ""extremely competitive"" conditions. He said he's ""confident"" more will 
be added because of the options that they provide to gas customers. As 
another way to enhance liquidity, KeySpan's Daverio ","Robert Levin

811,"Note:  Alliance says they are flowing 40-50% of capacity at this time 
(400-500 MMBtu/d 
hitting the Chicago market).  It sounds like they have not yet been able to 
commission the
Aux Sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through.  
Some predictors 
are saying the delay may get longer.

Alliance Service Delay Extended to End of November

Alliance Pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in-service date will 
have to be delayed for the third time, this time until the end of November, 
because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the 
enormously complex components of the system working in sync. The 1,900-mile 
project originally was supposed to be in service Oct. 1. 

""Normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has 
been removed from the line,"" says Alliance CEO Norm Gish. ""However, periodic 
reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the 
required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux 
Sable Liquid Products processing facility near Chicago."" A spokesman said the 
debris included ""bits of foam"" that came off equipment used to extract 
moisture following hydrostatic testing. 

The complexity of the Alliance Pipeline operations also has led some 
observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service. The pipeline 
has an immensely complicated system patented by Alliance engineers that is 
designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1.325 Bcf/d of 
natural gas from British Columbia and northern Alberta through 1,900 miles of 
pipe to the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant near Chicago. The pipeline 
also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow 
the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown Calgary control 
room. Alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines: a 
physical pipe, a paper pipe and an e-pipe, which brings all aspects of the 
operation together around the clock 365 days a year. ""It's a tremendously 
complicated system and all the parts are interdependent, for it to work, they 
all have to work together."" 

Regardless of the delay, however, Alliance already is flowing a large amount 
of gas into the Chicago market. ""At this point in our commissioning 
activities, the system is flowing at approximately 40 to 50% of capacity. We 
expect to continue increasing the volume of test gas and approaching our firm 
delivery capacity of 37.5 million cubic meters (1.325 Bcf) per day prior to 
the end of November.""

822,"One of the deliverables of Revenue Management is the Marketing Dashboard 
which, among a veritable cornucopia of features, will include live Nymex and 
Enron OnLine data pricing feeds.  The rollout of the Dashboard for NNG and TW 
is in the next 2 weeks.  However, the Nymex data feed won't happen till 
August due to technology limitations.  

In the meantime, via our desktops, we all have access to Enron OnLine which 
provides live market data that is as good or better than Nymex.  This should 
suffice in the interim till the Dashboard is fully functional.  Let me know 
if you have questions.

 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, bu=
t I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't =
know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.""   But Smith was able =
to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next w=
eek at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluat=
ed on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.    =
 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - The Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01 According to pu=
blished reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against =
Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action. Eddie Kennison , WR =
DEN - One Man Show Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards a=
gainst New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has rever=
ted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mi=
ke Anderson , RB DEN - The Guzzlers Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for on=
ly 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-ya=
rd run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yar=
ds also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.=
 David Patten , WR NE - The Snake Pit Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five p=
asses for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring t=
hreat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy B=
rown , WR NE - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86=
 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. =
Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams o=
n the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 1=
0/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the pas=
t, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie =
and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a F=
antasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - One Man Show Updated 10/28/01 Jone=
s overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passe=
s for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones =
may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to p=
refer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red=
 zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - The Guzzlers Updated 10/28/01 Centers was =
limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills id=
eally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, s=
o don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR B=
UF - ! Th! e Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 y=
ards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears t=
o have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasse=
lbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game a=
s a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he conti=
nued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downf=
ield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Nice Machine Updat=
ed 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Consider=
ing the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked res=
pectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post g=
ood yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overa=
ll output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/28/01 Gad=
sden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is=
 not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James =
McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/! 28! /01 McKnight caught eight p=
asses for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami r=
eceiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , R=
B NYG - The Nice Machine Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards o=
n eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbe=
rs, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , =
WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 10=
9 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player=
, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - The Execution=
ers Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was=
 held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but =
the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the =
ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 19=
0 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, ! no! w the =
erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce St=
aley , RB PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday agai=
nst Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with=
 two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush de=
fense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noti=
ng that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggest=
s that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky=
 starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - oops, I did it again Updated 10! /2! 8/=
01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelph=
ia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back=
 while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Execu=
tioners Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns an=
d no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall c=
hallenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with bette=
r stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers =
Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday =
against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot =
for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was stil=
l a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should =
break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of=
 the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Pittm=
an rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much =
better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will=
 be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Boston =
, WR ARI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for =
108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an incons=
istent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy p=
layer because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's e=
asily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, I =
did it again Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns a=
nd two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inc=
onsistent he can be. Unle! ss! the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn'=
t rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sund=
ay, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defen=
se has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup=
, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit wil=
l give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL =
- Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yard=
s, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 y=
ards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't gre=
at for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary=
. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  More Upd=

I know I've been heavily bearish and saying that a close above $19.40 would get
me back into a neutral tone, but I'm going to stick with even the near term bear
view for one more day. The market is reacting bearishly to what I see as neutral
stats. Distillate demand is high, due to run cuts and exports, but the
fundamental window of opportunity may have passed us by, By that I mean that the
traditional late Q1 rally is usually brought on by run cuts combined with cold
weather. Weather is not cooperating and gasoline has been flowing over here.
Price action for the past three days has been firm, especially the past two with
solid spread action. Still can't get behind the move, fighting it a bit, a
strong settle today has to change the short term bear strategy. I am still
extremely worried about the possibility of Russian oil companies ignoring the
OPEC quota and jumping over themselves to raise hard currency.

We have enclosed initial drafts of the following documents:

 1. Letter Agreement for the Turbine Transaction (clean copy and
blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the
turbine letter agreement with Coral);

 2. Letter Agreement for the Transformer Transaction (clean
copy, blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of
the transformer letter agreement with Coral, and blacklined copy marked to
reflect revisions from the turbine letter agreement referenced as item no. 1
above);

 3. Limited Liability Company Agreement (clean copy and
blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the
LLC agreement for CA/ED-II).

As mentioned on the telephone, I have retained a number of the
representations and warranties requested by Coral, with modifications where
necessary to eliminate those aspects which were objectionable to Enron.  The
justification for this is that nearly any purchaser would insist on such
representations, and it is often more advantageous to present a draft that
appears to be neutral, rather than allow the counterparty to focus on what
is not there and then have the advantage of drafting precisely what it
wants.  Therefore, we suggest that Enron carefully review the
representations and warranties in order that any objectionable items can be
eliminated before circulation of documents to the counterparty.  Because we
rearranged and reorganized the representations and warranties to make a more
clear presentation, the blacklined drafts will not be very helpful fur
purposes of reviewing representations and warranties.

Please review the enclosed at your convenience and advise of any comments.
Thank you.

887,"Hello Kay -

It's been a long time since we've last spoken and I hope things are well.
In November, Gregg Penman had sent me two confidentiality agreements related
to enovate and asked that I forward any comments to you directly.  I finally
have reviewed them and have a couple comments.

The only proposed changes that need explanation are in paragraphs 1 and 3 of
each agreement.  Paragraphs 1 and 3 are typical provisions in a
confidentiality agreement where each side is evaluating a transaction.
However, the confidential information disclosed under these particular
agreements is going to be used not only for trading activities but also in
connection with audit rights related to an existing and ongoing contractual
relationship.  The confidentiality agreements should not affect enovate's
and PMW's rights under the LLC Agreement.  Accordingly, the proposed changes
are my attempt to clarify the usual text.

Please call if you wish to discuss.  I believe my procrastination has
resulted in the business people wanting to sign these up next week, so your
attention to this is appreciated.  Thanks.

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen 
project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout 
contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does 
GE know this is coming?

What are you projecting for a closing date?

 We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, 
price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the 
LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract.  
Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?

If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We 
have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact, 
I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the 
other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm 
sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I 
can get started on the process if you are ready.

If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want 
two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk to 
me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

One of the first things we do after we execute an option agreement is to get

911,"I have since met with Ben on this agreement but wanted to let you see my 
comments as you are incorporating Deerfield's changes.  I was in meetings all 
day and just realized that I never sent this out.

Finance comments.  I have left a message with Rose asking what her comments 
to you were so we could coordinate.  Since I haven't heard from her yet I 
will provide these and follow-up if there are any others which need 
mentioning after I speak with her.

1.  The Effective Date needs to change to ""2001""

2.  In Section 2 Landscaping: To avoid any accounting issues raised by 
Accounting, it would be very helpful and along the intent as you indicated to 
Billy, if you would add at the beginning: ""After commencement of construction 
of the Facility but prior to the issuance of a CofO.......""

3.  Section 4 needs to have a global search done to change all the ""PBEC""s to 
""DBEC""s.

4.  Section 6:  Is the Facility truly deemed a ""Factory"" for permitting fees 
or are we changing the normal classification for a power plant in this 
agreement?

5.  Section 7(b):  Will we be charging the City for the easement for their 
cellular tower?  What is the consideration otherwise for doing so since we 
are paying them all sorts of money for the other items for which we are using 
the City?

 Extra period at the end of this Section.

6.  In the Termination Section can we put in the language from Pompano Beach 
which said that if the Agreement is terminated, all parties relieved of their 
obligations and an instrument would be recorded with County (offset to 
initial recordation of Agreement) indicating that Ag terminated and all 
obligations of the parties have been released?

7.  Does the City need to obtain any approvals prior to execution or at any 
other time to execute and have this be a valid agreement on their part?

8.  I noted that there is no Notices section nor Counterparts section.  Are 
they truly not needed here?  Execution occurring in same place on same doc?

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Pontiac TSS.  
Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission 
Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of 
receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the 
ComEd queue.  If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the 
ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C.

Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 that were signed this
week by the President.  As you know, the HSR Act imposes a premerger
notification obligation for mergers and acquisitions exceeding certain size
thresholds.

The amendments take effect as of February 1, 2001 and govern transactions
that close on or after that date.  As anticipated, the amendments increase
the size-of-transaction threshold from $15 million to $50 million, and they
eliminate the 15% prong of the size-of-transaction threshold.  They also
eliminate the size-of-person threshold for transactions with a value
exceeding $200 million.  Congress projects that about half of filings will
be eliminated under the new thresholds.  The amendments also adopt a
three-tier filing fee structure, with filing fees increased for larger
transactions.

On Monday, Austin Energy asked if they could take early title certain 
equipment (the foxbourgh equipment - sp?) in order to ""work around"" an 
internal budget issue.  Apparently, if AE takes early title, they will be 
able to pay for the equipment (approx $440,000) from another fund and avoid 
the appearance of being over budget on the 4 LM project.
Based upon my discussions with various internal groups, ENA is comfortable 
with either option #2 or option #3 below.  See the tax response from Warren 
below.  David Marshall is comfortable from an insurance perspective.  Kay 
Mann (lawyer on GE breakout contract) confirmed in a voicemail that she did 
not anticipate the title transfer creating an issue with the warranties 
granted to ENA in the breakout agreement.
Keenan phoned Chris Kirksey yesterday to relay the message that based upon 
preliminary discussions, we are comfortable with either approach.

Next Steps:

Jeffrey anticipates hearing from Chris today to get preliminary feedback on 
if Austin needs title (option #3) or if the ""acknowledgement letter"" (option 
#2) would suffice.
Monday, December 4, there is an internal meeting to discuss the topic.

Enron Global Markets has experienced tremendous growth since inception and 
this growth rate will continue to increase as new businesses and markets are 
developed.  In order to ensure EGM Operations & Accounting is positioned to 
provide the highest level of support and value to each EGM business unit, I 
am pleased to announce the following organizational changes effective 
immediately.

Physical Commodity Operations
These groups, which include Crude & Products, Coal, LNG, Freight and Weather, 
are being reorganized along functional lines to provide better focus and 
promote efficiencies across these operational activities.  Weather is being 
included in this group to maintain the consistency of current Operations 
leadership in this area.

      Business Risk Controls
Todd Hall will assume the role as Business Risk Controller on a worldwide 
basis for the physical businesses.  This group will have responsibility for 
all Risk Management activities and serve as the daily commercial interface 
for all operational issues that affect the physical businesses.

North America Operations
Michelle Bruce will assume responsibility for the following activities that 
support the physical businesses for North America:  Confirmations, 
Coordination, Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Michelle and her team will 
also play a key role in coordinating operational activities as they relate to 
potential acquisitions and new business opportunities within North America.

Europe/Asia Operations
Cindy Horn will continue in her role managing the following activities for 
the physical businesses in Europe and Asia:  Confirmations, Coordination, 
Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Cindy and her team will also have the 
critical responsibility of ensuring proper controls and processes are 
maintained for all new and existing markets throughout the region.  Tiong 
Hock Lim and his team in Singapore will report to Cindy.

Financial Commodity Operations
Sheila Glover will expand her current role and manage all business risk and 
operational activities for Financial Trading and Global Risk Management.  As 
the Global Risk Management business grows, Sheila will develop the 
operational processes and infrastructure necessary to support it.

Todd, Michelle, Cindy and Sheila will also work together as a Controller team 
to ensure processes and controls are consistent across EGM and that 
efficiencies are broadly applied.

Structuring/Transaction Analysis
Scott Earnest will assume responsibility for all commodity structuring and 
transaction analysis activities across EGM.  His duties will include pricing 
and valuation of new transactions and businesses, evaluation of existing 
transactions to identify restructuring opportunities and risk controls 
monitoring and reporting.  

Technology
Kevin Sweeney will continue in his role as Technology Controller.  Kevin and 
his team will be completing the implementation of Project Thunderball for 
Crude & Products and Coal and will also serve as the Business Leads for 
system enhancements and new technology opportunities that are identified.

Chris,

Hello from Houston.  I really enjoyed meeting with you last Saturday at your 
gallery.  Your collection of work is very impressive.

I have not received your digital pictures that you were putting together but 
I did talk with my wife about the Bonnard.  The Bonnard is my first choice of 
all the pieces we discussed.  I found an illustration of it on the net (from 
another gallery) and she liked (although - not as much as me).  I am prepared 
to purchase a Bonnard and the Radiator is my first choice.  I would like to 
establish a relationship and do business with your gallery and would like to 
know what is your best price for the piece.  I will not shop the price around 
and will make a quick decision with a credit card number.   When I get your 
response and if it is competitive, I'll confirm the purchase when I pick up 
the email.

Thanks,
Mike McConnell

PS - I will hold off on the others for now and when you send me the pictures 
I will show them to my wife for consideration.  I am considering the Mary 
Cassat as a gift for her.",Chris Neptune Chris Mike McConnell Mary,,

Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update4)

     (Updates with Chief Financial Officer Fastow didn't
immediately return a call for comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares have
fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest
energy trader's dealings with partnerships run by its chief
financial officer contributed to investment losses.

     Enron's stock dropped 10 percent today. Enron's board cost
the company at least $35 million by allowing Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to manage LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,
partnerships that bought Enron assets, a shareholder alleged
Wednesday in a lawsuit.

     The lawsuit came the day after Enron reported $1.01 billion
in third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall Street
Journal reported $35 million of the losses were connected with the
two limited partnerships. Enron also reduced shareholders' equity
by $1.2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the
partnerships, the paper reported yesterday.

     ``It looks sleazy,'' said Roger Hamilton, a manager at John
Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares. ``If you are
someone who invests in a company's management, it's almost time to
punt with Enron.''

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't return calls or written
requests seeking comment. Fastow didn't immediately return a
telephone call for comment.

     Fastow and a handful of associates made more than $7 million
last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital
increases on an investment of about $3 million in one of the
partnerships, the Journal reported today.

                        Buying Enron Assets

     Fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and
partnerships that appear to have ties to Houston-based Enron,
based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.

     The foreign business corporations and limited liability
companies have directors, officers or managers whose address is
listed as 1400 Smith Street in Houston, Enron's corporate address,
according to Texas records.

     Fastow is listed as a director, officer or managing member in
each one. At least one of the companies bought and sold Enron
assets, including foreign power plants.

     Whitewing Management, which lists Fastow as its managing
member, received $807 million from the sale of Enron debt last
year.

    Under the terms of the debt sale, Whitewing is allowed to use
the proceeds to buy power plants from Enron or make other
``permitted investments.'' Whitewing has bought 14 Enron plants or
companies since 1999 and sold four.

     Enron's Denne has not responded to written requests about
Fastow's role at Whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the
value of Enron assets to benefit outside investors or company
executives at Enron's expense.

     Shares of Enron fell $2.95 to $26.05. They have fallen
69 percent this year.

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

How's it going?  I will not be at rehearsal tonight because I'm going to get 
my hair done.  I figured that you all will be practicing (is that how you 
spell practice) your Easter songs and I will be in Omaha for Easter so I 
don't need to learn the songs, as we only sing them on Easter anyway.  
Besides, just in case you didn't hear, we don't sing this Sunday (We switch 
with the kids), since you all will sing on Easter for all 4 services.

This daylight savings time is nice.  It's so nice to be able to get home and 
still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it 
gets dark.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). ","David Oxley

I spoke with Mike yesterday and he filled me in on his correspondence with both of you.  I appreciate your assistance in identifying potential opportunities for me in Portland.  

John and I are planning a relocation in the near future and I have always had an interest in the Portland office.  Still, this is a fairly involved decision for us and at present we are discussing a number of  options.  Therefore, while I am preparing my resume to forward to your HR rep, I would appreciate it if you could hold off on speaking with Tim for a few days.  That should give me enough time to work through a few of the options with John.  Thanks again for your help.

1011,"EPA has announced that it will move forward in publishing a proposed rule to guide states in setting ""best available retrofit technology"" (BART) requirements to comply with new Regional Haze standards.  The proposal was approved on Jan. 12 by then-EPA Administrator Carol Browner, but current Administrator Whitman was reviewing that decision to see if EPA should change course.   It is now clear that EPA intends to move forward.   The compliance deadline will be around 2008, but companies will be making decisions in the shorter-term about installing technologies or other compliance strategies.

The BART requirements will primarily affect coal utilities as well as industrial boilers, refiners and steel plants built between 1962 and 1977.   While the rule will apply nationwide to facilities affecting national park areas, the main target of the rule were sources in Western U.S. states affecting visibility in the Grand Canyon.

In addition to technology requirements, an emissions trading program could become part of the compliance regime for the Western states, but only if the BART requirements are not providing the targeted reductions.

The AP story below provides a good summary of the rule.  Or if you're really adventurous, you can access the original 148-page proposed rule at: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t1/fr_notices/bartrule.pdf

EPA Adopts Rule to Cut Haze in Parks
By JOHN HEILPRIN, Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration will not challenge a proposal
approved in the last days of the Clinton presidency to clean up hazy skies
over national parks and wilderness areas, Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Christie Whitman said Tuesday.

The proposed rule, requiring states to impose pollution controls on
hundreds of older power plants, was approved by President Clinton eight
days before he left office. It would require coal-fired utilities,
industrial boilers, refineries and iron and steel plants built between 1962
and 1977 to be retrofitted with new pollution-control technology by 2013.

However, some could meet the requirements by swapping pollution credits,
which companies can earn and trade by reducing their overall emissions.

``Part of the President's commitment to protecting national parks includes
protecting the views that draw us to these parks year after year,'' Whitman
said. ``We intend to clear that air. This rule will help ensure that people
will be able to see and appreciate these national treasures for many years
to come.''

That would cut sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter and
directly improve the air in 156 national parks and wilderness areas, the
EPA said. Haze is caused when light hits tiny particles, such as soot,
sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide emitted by power plants, refineries or
natural pollution sources, such as forest fires.

Whitman said the visibility in some national parks, like the Great Smoky
Mountains, is reduced by as much as 80 percent on the haziest days.

Environmentalists said Tuesday they worried the administration still might
try to delay or weaken the Clinton-era proposal before a final rule is
issued. The proposed rule already was studied by several federal agencies
under former President Clinton.

``The concern is that the White House or the Office of Management and
Budget or the utility industry would push for a weakening of the more
aggressive approach reflected in the Clinton proposal,'' said John Walke,
director of clean air programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Meanwhile, a group of utility companies has been fighting in federal court
for the past two years to block the EPA's regional haze program.

The proposed rule, amending part of EPA's 1999 regional haze rule, tells
states which of the older industrial facilities that emit more than 250
tons of view-impairing pollutants annually must install ``best available
retrofit technology.''

But it also gives states flexibility to consider economic factors, energy
impacts and the remaining useful life of the facility. The new requirements
also could be met through an emissions trading plan similar to one used in
EPA's acid rain program, giving states that take this option more time
beyond 2013 to comply.

States that affect the air quality of the Grand Canyon - Arizona,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming -
also would get different time frames to work with, the EPA said.

In Western states, the pollution cuts a 140-mile view down to 33 to 90
miles on average, the EPA said. In the East, 90-mile views often are
reduced to 14 to 24 miles on average.","Carol Browner Whitman Jeffrey Keeler

                   BODY: 


                   Tom Hicks was beside himself. He couldn't sit in one 
place. And 
                   he couldn't stand. He couldn't even bear to watch at 
times, but 
                   the buoyant CEO and chairman of Hicks Muse Tate & Furst, 
the 
                   giant buyout firm, also couldn't afford to turn away, 
because 
                   this deal could go either way. I'm not talking about the 
                   company's pending $ 200 million bet on an Internet outfit 
called 
                   Teligent. That's pocket change to a business managing more 
than 
                   $ 11 billion in assets. This was really big. This was 
Saturday 
                   afternoons in the fall. This was perky cheerleaders flying 
                   through the air, and high-stepping marching bands. This 
was 
                   college football. This was Texas. 

                   On this autumn Saturday afternoon in Austin, the 
University of 
                   Texas Longhorns led powerful Nebraska with only a few 
minutes on 
                   the clock at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, the 
team's 
                   newly renovated home. A win would be huge. The 
Cornhuskers, 
                   perennial national title contenders, were big-bully 
conference 
                   rivals and ranked third in the nation, while the young 
Longhorns 
                   were like clumsy calves still finding their legs under 
                   second-year coach Mack Brown. Hicks is a proud and 
generous alum 
                   (Texas Exes, they're called), and he's deep into this Hook 
'em 
                   Horns thing. Two years ago he flew athletic director 
DeLoss 
                   Dodds to North Carolina on his private plane to woo Brown 
to 
                   Austin personally, and he regularly counsels the coach on 
                   management matters. He also advised Dodds about pricing, 
                   financing, and amenities when Texas built 66 posh private 
suites 
                   at the stadium before last season. In October he hosted a 
                   charity golf tournament in Dallas during the raucous 
                   Texas-Oklahoma weekend to benefit the school's sports 
programs. 
                   He owns the Texas Rangers baseball team and the NHL Dallas 
                   Stars, but Tom Hicks loves the Texas Longhorns. 

                   So it's understandable that he was a bit on edge at the 
Nebraska 
                   game, hosting a couple of dozen friends, relatives, and 
business 
                   associates in one of the glitzy new suites high above the 
field 
                   at the Nebraska game. Wearing a Longhorn burnt-orange 
shirt and 
                   surrounded by enough ice-cream bars and shrimp to satisfy 
an 
                   offensive line, Hicks was anxious and animated. ""Hey,"" he 
yelled, 
                   ""ain't this something?"" 

                   It sure is. The University of Texas athletic program is at 
a 
                   pretty intriguing place in college sports. With a surging 
young 
                   football team at its core, it is one of the most 
successful 
                   college athletic programs in the country, and I'm not just 
                   talking about wins and losses. This is a 
multimillion-dollar 
                   enterprise that operates more like a solid business than a 
                   renegade campus outfit. College sports has been a 
big-ticket 
                   dance for some time now, and this program is much like 
others at 
                   the top-tier universities, but there are a couple of 
exceptions: 
                   The folks making the moves in Austin function more like 
CEOs than 
                   like traditional athletic directors and coaches, and 
they're 
                   making it work. 

                   To determine how they do it, I went back to school this 
fall and 
                   asked to take a close look at the books. What I found was 
an 
                   operation that balances the athletic department's 
educational 
                   responsibilities with fiscal discipline at a time when the 
costs 
                   of running a big-time athletic program are surging and 
most 
                   college athletic programs are in the red. I found a place 
where 
                   football pays the bills. That was no surprise, but this 
was: 
                   Among the beneficiaries of big-time football is a women's 
sports 
                   program that could be a model for gender equity. 

                   In fact, at the University of Texas, the football 
Longhorns are 
                   Grade A cash cows. Athletics officials credit the team 
with 
                   generating a staggering 80% of the department's $ 45.3 
million 
                   from revenues in 1999. That's $ 36 million from tickets, 
                   individual donations, rights fees, sponsorships, hot dogs, 
beer, 
                   and other sources. 

                   The athletic department operates much like a 
self-contained 
                   corporation, separate and apart from the rest of the 
university. 
                   It has its core business (football); various auxiliary 
operations 
                   (other men's and women's teams); numerous revenue streams; 
                   traditional corporate functions such as finance, 
marketing, 
                   public relations, and HR (you know it as recruiting); and 
even 
                   sophisticated satellite offices--dozens of alumni chapters 
                   nationwide, through which athletics targets some 400,000 
Texas 
                   Exes for private gifts. Got shareholders? You bet. More 
than 
                   80,000 of them meet in the stadium in Austin on Saturdays 
in the 
                   fall, and they grade every move Mack Brown makes. Think 
chasing 
                   quarterly expectations is brutal? Try putting the success 
of your 
                   company in the hands of a bunch of 18- to 22-year-olds. 
Hate 
                   talking to analysts? Try answering Buck from Muleshoe, 
Texas, on 
                   a weekly call-in talk show after losing a 23-point lead in 
the 
                   fourth quarter. 

                   Of course, the whole thing is complicated by the fact that 
while 
                   a major-college athletic program must be managed with the 
                   diligence of a public company, athletic directors don't 
have the 
                   luxury of shutting down unprofitable businesses--at most 
schools 
                   that would be every sport save football and men's 
basketball. And 
                   those well-paid football coaches, quite simply, must win. 
""If we 
                   were a business, we wouldn't have any sport but football, 
and we 
                   would generate a heck of a profit,"" says Dodds, who is 
among the 
                   nation's most respected athletic directors. ""But we're not 
about 
                   that. We take the money we generate from football and use 
it to 
                   provide opportunities for other kids. Then we try to 
balance what 
                   we want to accomplish inside the institution with what 
folks 
                   outside the institution want us to do. It's a hard thing 
to do."" 

                   For more than a quarter-century, one of the most difficult 
                   challenges for college sports has been finding a place for 
women. 
                   You've probably heard of Title IX, the historic clause in 
the 
                   Education Amendments Act of 1972 that turned college 
sports on 
                   its ear by requiring athletic programs to offer equality 
for 
                   women in participation, scholarship allocation, 
recruitment 
                   spending, and coaching resources. The requirement forced 
athletic 
                   departments to essentially double their operations, which 
helped 
                   spark the overall growth in college sports. So whatever 
you think 
                   about the emphasis on college football, hey, it pays for 
women's 
                   soccer, okay? 

                   The Texas athletic department's budget is among the 
largest in 
                   the nation--$ 41.2 million for fiscal 1999, which ended in 
                   August. Only four universities had fatter sports wallets 
that 
                   year: Wisconsin ($ 41.4 million), Tennessee ($ 45 
million), 
                   Michigan ($ 47.6 million), and Ohio State, No. 1 by far 
with a 
                   whopping $ 64.9 million athletics budget. (If you think 
those who 
                   spend the most win, forget it: OSU is the only school of 
the 
                   group not ranked in the latest Top 25 AP football poll.) 

                   How does UT get to its number? For starters, ticket sales 
and 
                   game guarantees (payments to UT by a host school when the 
                   Longhorns play on the road) generated $ 10.1 million in 
revenue 
                   last year. That category was exceeded only by private 
gifts, 
                   which totaled an impressive $ 21 million. Other 
significant 
                   income categories included suite-lease revenue ($ 3.2 
million), 
                   television money ($ 3.9 million), payment for the team's 
Cotton 
                   Bowl appearance ($ 866,842), optional student fees ($ 
570,000), 
                   sponsorships and advertising ($ 400,000), licensing 
revenue 
                   ($ 300,000), and concessions ($ 750,000). All told, the 
department 
                   generated $ 45.4 million in 1999. 

                   The athletic department's expenses totaled $ 50.1 million. 
That 
                   included scholarships valued at $ 2.8 million for 226 men 
and 186 
                   women, administrative costs ($ 1.4 million) for about 230 
                   employees, and equipment purchases ($ 2.4 million). The 
costs of 
                   running individual teams ranged from $ 7.5 million for 
football to 
                   $ 370,000 for tennis. 

                   What caused the shortfall? The final bills for a two-year, 
$ 93 
                   million capital improvement effort. Remarkably, the 
athletic 
                   department completed the project without a penny from the 
                   university's academic funds. It raised more than $ 31 
million in 
                   private donations in just over two years. The department 
also 
                   took out $ 48 million in bonds (serviced now by lease and 
ticket 
                   revenues). The bill was closed with $ 14 million from the 
                   university's Parking and Traffic division to fund a 
parking 
                   garage. So what can you get for $ 93 million? Take a 
stroll down 
                   East Campus Drive near the stadium, and you'll pass the 
spiffy 
                   new $ 28 million Mike A. Myers Stadium and Soccer Field. 
One block 
                   over is maybe the nicest football practice facility in the 
                   country, the newly renovated Denius Athletic Fields ($ 2.5 
                   million). It was subsidized by 82-year-old World War II 
veteran 
                   Frank A. Denius, a longtime fan who has attended practices 
most 
                   every day for as long as anyone can remember. 

                   Beyond the 66 suites at Royal-Memorial stadium, UT added 
nearly 
                   7,000 new seats, renovated major sections on both sides of 
the 
                   76-year-old facility, and lowered the field three feet. 
Why lower 
                   the field, you ask? I did too. Better sightlines, of 
course. The 
                   stadium renovations cost $ 55 million--$ 3.2 million to 
lower the 
                   field alone! The department also spruced up its main 
offices, now 
                   known as the Moncrief-Neuhaus Complex. (If you've got an 
extra 
                   million, you can get your name slapped on just about 
anything.) 
                   The place is Four Seasons plush. There's an impressive 
academic 
                   support center stocked with computers, a hangar-sized 
weight room 
                   that could inspire a couch potato, and an over-the-top 
football 
                   locker room any NFL team would envy--custom-carved 
benches, 
                   original art, and lockers the size of small Manhattan 
apartments. 
                   Mack Brown's spacious office, with a picture window 
overlooking 
                   the stadium field, is trimmed in warm cherrywood and 
decorated 
                   with mementos and collectibles, including a case of 
watches 
                   commemorating universities and bowl games where he has 
coached 
                   during his 24-year career. Photos from the Longhorn 
archives line 
                   the hallways, and display cases in the lobby house the 
school's 
                   three national championship trophies (1963, '69, and '70) 
and the 
                   1977 Heisman Trophy, won by the man who is still the most 
                   powerful and exciting running back in college football 
history, 
                   former Longhorn Earl Campbell. Check out the intricate, 
                   hand-carved leather saddles in the cavernous players' 
lounge. 
                   Yep, you can sit on the saddles and watch games. 

                   If it all seems impossibly lavish, there are reasons. The 
stadium 
                   upgrade generates new revenue, and the school had to build 
new 
                   facilities for its women's programs under requirements 
outlined 
                   in Title IX. But perhaps the most vital reason is 
recruiting. ""We 
                   had to stay sexy and attractive to the kids,"" says Ed 
Goble, UT's 
                   vice president of business affairs. ""You've got to provide 
an 
                   enhanced experience on campus to compete for the best 
kids."" 

                   CEO and COO would be more appropriate titles for Dodds and 
Brown, 
                   the UT athletic director and head football coach. Dodds, a 
                   62-year-old former track coach, got into sports 
administration 
                   because he liked working with coaches. Today he has an 
associate 
                   athletic director who handles those duties. Dodds is too 
busy 
                   closing new sponsorship deals, negotiating Big 12 
Conference 
                   television and radio contracts, glad-handing with 
boosters, 
                   serving on NCAA committees, and promoting his 
self-described 
                   ""passion""--a college football championship tournament. 
Dodds 
                   believes critics of a post-season tournament for college 
                   football--the only major sport without a legitimate 
championship 
                   tournament--are, after years of debate, softening. If it 
were to 
                   happen, it would have to be approved within the next 18 
months, 
                   says Dodds, a ""window"" before negotiations for the next 
round of 
                   network television contracts kick into gear. Dodds thinks 
a 
                   college football championship would generate about $ 2 
million for 
                   each of the 120 or so schools playing Division I-A 
football. ""I 
                   think that over a seven-year period a football playoff is 
worth 
                   several billion,"" he says. 

                   In the grand scheme of the college sports industry, $ 2 
million 
                   may not seem like much, but Dodds knows well that success 
comes 
                   with a price. After last season, when Brown took the 
Longhorns to 
                   a post-season bowl for the first time since 1990, Dodds 
ripped up 
                   the coach's original contract and signed him to a new 
ten-year 
                   deal worth $ 1 million annually. He added an annuity, 
largely 
                   funded by private donors, that will give Brown $ 1 million 
                   annually at age 60 should he remain another four years. 

                   By the way, Brown does earn more than the university 
president, 
                   Dr. Larry R. Faulkner, whose salary is $ 319,400. So does 
                   basketball coach Rick Barnes, who earns $ 750,000. But if 
you're 
                   looking for the sort of acrimony between sports and 
academics 
                   that tears so many schools apart, you won't find much of 
it here. 
                   ""I have a lot of respect for Dodds, his inventiveness, and 
his 
                   way of keeping the organization attuned to opportunities,"" 
says 
                   Faulkner. ""I've certainly paid attention to that."" 

                   The football coach actually gets to ""coach"" about as much 
as Bill 
                   Gates gets to play videogames these days. His nine 
assistants 
                   structure and manage practices and deal with most routine 
player 
                   matters. Brown, like any top-level executive, is expected 
to be 
                   the company's outside guy. He's your COO with a whistle. 
Most of 
                   his hours are filled with media obligations (about two 
dozen 
                   television and radio stations and newspapers cover the 
                   Longhorns), fundraising (for the entire university as well 
as the 
                   athletic department), and trying to keep his own 
management team 
                   in place. (After last season, seven of his assistant 
coaches were 
                   offered head coaching jobs elsewhere; Brown kept them all, 
adding 
                   $ 250,000 to the department's payroll. Additionally, five 
coaches 
                   were granted annuities worth $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 at age 
60 if they 
                   hang on with Brown for four more years.) 

                   On occasion, Brown also telephones one of the many 
corporate 
                   executives who are big UT boosters, guys like Hicks and 
San 
                   Antonio car dealer Red McCombs, another alum and the owner 
of the 
                   NFL's Minnesota Vikings. Brown looks to Hicks for 
time-management 
                   advice and insights on coping with pressure. With McCombs 
he 
                   talks talent and tries to absorb some of the owner's 
upbeat 
                   attitude. (""Hey, you're talking to one of only two owners 
who're 
                   going to the Super Bowl,"" McCombs told Brown after an 
                   early-season Longhorn loss. At the time, the Vikings were 
1-2). 
                   ""One of the things that's common in both of them is that 
they're 
                   high energy,"" says Brown. ""They have the ability to dream, 
they 
                   have a lot of imagination, and they don't get down very 
much."" In 
                   some areas, though, Brown is on his own. ""The difference 
between 
                   their business and ours is that they can hire and fire who 
they 
                   want to,"" the coach said one October afternoon while 
lounging on 
                   one of the plush leather couches in his office. ""In my 
business, 
                   we put our paychecks in the mouths of 18- to 22-year-olds 
we 
                   can't fire. It's like that ugly-baby theory--we can't get 
rid of 
                   them. So we have to hug them and teach them better. 
Another 
                   thing--CEOs don't have to deal with mothers. The major 
difference 
                   for us is the kids."" 

                   Brown's kids were whooping it up with 80,000-plus Longhorn 
                   faithful on that October afternoon when the pop of the 
final gun 
                   signaled the end of the Nebraska game. Final score: Texas 
24, 
                   Nebraska 20. The victory was a turning point for the young 
                   Longhorns that propelled them to their finest season in 
years. 
                   Going into their last regular-season game against Texas 
A&M, the 
                   Longhorns have their best record (9-2) since winning ten 
games in 
                   1995--albeit one that ended in an atmosphere of tragedy. A 
week 
                   before the game 12 students were killed and 28 injured on 
the A&M 
                   campus while building a huge bonfire structure for a 
pregame 
                   rally. As FORTUNE went to press the game was scheduled to 
be 
                   played. 

                   This year the Longhorns have been ranked as high as sixth 
in the 
                   AP Top 25, their highest perch since 1996. Their reward? A 
                   possible trip to the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in January, a 
                   prestigious bowl game despite its name. Each team in the 
game 
                   receives $ 1.5 million. To put it another way, the 
Nebraska 
                   victory paid off for the Longhorns like an Internet IPO. 
So 
                   while Dodds appeared calm amid the post-game celebrations, 
he 
                   was actually more relieved than anything. ""If you don't 
win, 
                   you're not doing your job,"" he said. ""And you don't 
survive."" 

                   There have been times of real doubt in recent years at UT 
                   athletics as the program struggled to find its way back to 
                   football prominence in the '90s. But perhaps the most 
                   significant crisis occurred in 1992, when seven female 
athletes 
                   filed a lawsuit against the university charging that it 
had 
                   failed to comply with Title IX. When the suit was filed, 
about 
                   37% of UT's varsity athletes were women, and female 
athletes 
                   received about $ 1 million in scholarships, well short of 
the 
                   $ 2.8 million awarded to male varsity athletes. Some 
executives 
                   inside the department wanted to fight the charges. Recalls 
Jody 
                   Conradt, UT's women's athletic director and head coach of 
                   women's basketball: ""Some folks said, 'Let's have a final 
war 
                   right here on the University of Texas campus, and let's 
just see 
                   who's right!' Thankfully, DeLoss and others said, 'That's 
not 
                   the way. We need to sit down and come up with a solution. 
"" Just 
                   three days after negotiations began, the university 
settled, 
                   essentially agreeing to all demands. Today, 43% of the 
                   department's scholarship dollars are spent for female 
athletes, 
                   who represent 43.7% of UT's athletes. 

                   Dodds believes that if the esteemed founders of college 
sports 
                   had not spurned female athletes from the start, then the 
industry 
                   would not have endured the turmoil that ruling ignited. 
                   ""Somebody, somewhere, made a big mistake,"" he says. 
""Somebody, 
                   somewhere, decided women didn't need to be in sports, and 
I don't 
                   know why we weren't smart enough to fix it sooner."" 

                   The person most credited with nudging--some say 
shoving--Texas in 
                   the right direction on gender equity is Donna Lopiano, a 
longtime 
                   activist for equity for women in sports and now head of 
the 
                   Women's Sports Foundation. She became women's athletic 
director 
                   at the University of Texas in 1975, the first woman in the 
                   country to hold an AD title at a major university. Like 
many 
                   advocates for gender equity, she felt the university was 
dragging 
                   toward Title IX compliance, but as a university official 
she 
                   could not openly encourage students to challenge the 
university. 
                   Instead she handed out Title IX manuals and complaint 
forms from 
                   boxes she stashed behind her desk like candy at Halloween. 
""Must 
                   have done it hundreds of times, for 17 years,"" she says, 
laughing 
                   at the memory. ""I had boxes of manuals and more boxes to 
replace 
                   them. I couldn't believe it when somebody finally did it."" 
By 
                   ""it,"" she means filed suit. 

                   ""It took someone to be abrasive, pushy, and all the other 
                   adjectives her friends use for Donna,"" says Conradt. 
""Donna 
                   scares people. It wouldn't have happened any other way. No 
                   question, she's the most significant individual for what 
we've 
                   been able to achieve in women's athletics."" 

                   Today women's athletics at UT has its own corporate 
structure 
                   and hierarchy. It shares resources with the men in many 
areas, 
                   but it has its own management team, led by Conradt, who, 
like 
                   Dodds, reports to university vice president Pat Ohlendorf. 
Only 
                   a handful of Division I programs are similarly structured. 
""I 
                   think young women need to see women as bosses,"" Conradt 
says. 
                   ""If the [men's and women's] departments merged, how would 
women 
                   get the chance to run any of the areas? This way we have 
role 
                   models for student athletes."" 

                   The women still have a long way to go before reaching 
parity in 
                   one critical area--fundraising. Last year gifts received 
by 
                   women's sports totaled only $ 250,000. But the women are 
not 
                   without their boosters, Red McCombs being the biggest. Two 
events 
                   led McCombs to an epiphany regarding women's sports. One 
came 
                   during what he described as a ""good ol' Bubba"" meeting 
about 
                   fundraising a few years back. When he asked the lone woman 
in the 
                   room to name the most generous donors for women's 
athletics, he 
                   recalls, ""She looked at me like I was crazy and said, 'Mr. 
                   McCombs, there are none.'"" 

                   Soon afterward, McCombs' young granddaughter told him that 
she 
                   could not find a girls' softball team to join. He realized 
that 
                   wasn't going to change as long as the woman in the good 
ol' Bubba 
                   meeting was right. So four years ago he wrote a check for 
$ 3 
                   million to the UT women's athletic program, the largest 
single 
                   gift to women's collegiate sports anyone can recall. 
Earlier this 
                   year the Red and Charline McCombs Softball Stadium opened 
on UT's 
                   campus. 

                   Title IX clearly stoked the growth in college sports 
programs a 
                   quarter-century ago, but where will the money come from to 
                   sustain future growth? There's at least some concern that 
college 
                   sports is already locked squarely in corporate America's 
cross 
                   hairs as the next sports-marketing frontier. For years 
only the 
                   likes of Nike, Reebok, and other sports brands had major 
deals 
                   with college teams. Now high-tech companies like eBay and 
Nextel 
                   are lining up alongside soft-drink, financial-services, 
and 
                   entertainment companies to sell their products and 
services to 
                   your kids. Companies once worried about being called crass 
for 
                   slapping logos on college campuses. Today there is no 
shame. Take 
                   the annual Texas-Oklahoma game, the meeting of two of the 
most 
                   celebrated rivals in college football history. For two 
years now 
                   it has been called the Dr Pepper Red River Shootout, also 
                   sponsored by Southwestern Bell, Mercedes-Benz, Bank of 
America, 
                   Miller Brewing, and the Texas Land & Cattle Co., a local 
                   restaurant chain. It's worth in excess of $ 100,000 to 
each 
                   school. Be very afraid. 

                   For now, corporate deals remain only a minor revenue 
source for 
                   most big colleges. But as TV money and ticket prices peak, 
and 
                   donors get short arms and can't reach their wallets (after 
a 
                   couple of dog seasons, you'll see what I mean), it could 
become 
                   the most vital source of future growth. Texas' new deal 
with 
                   Nike, for instance, provides UT athletics with up to $ 1.8 
million 
                   in Nike gear, along with $ 850,000 in cash annually for 
the next 
                   nine years. That's equal to the largest sponsorship deal 
in 
                   college sports, and more than twice the value of the 
department's 
                   previous contract with Reebok. 

                   While Dodds is mindful of the need to maintain some 
boundaries 
                   against unbridled commercialism, he's more concerned that 
some 
                   major college programs may be forced out of big-time 
football 
                   altogether because they can't keep up with escalating 
costs. 
                   Sometimes the scale of all this makes Dodds wistful. ""What 
I'd 
                   like to do is maybe start over with this whole thing,"" he 
says, 
                   ""because it's gotten to the point where you don't control 
it, you 
                   manage it, and it's a challenge."" 

                   Nevertheless: Texas is banking on being a leader in 
e-commerce 
                   for college sports. Sales through its nascent Website are 
almost 
                   nil. But with nearly a half-million Texas Exes out 
here--and 
                   Longhorn football on a roll--the upside is vast. Hook 'em, 
iHorns? 

                   On that Saturday afternoon in the fall when the Longhorns 
grew 
                   up against Nebraska, an elderly fan in dark glasses sat 
quietly 
                   on the front row of a luxury box at the stadium named in 
his 
                   honor. Darrell Royal is still greeted as ""Coach Royal"" 
around 
                   Austin. He's in awe of his surroundings, amazed that the 
program 
                   he helped build has become a multimillion-dollar 
operation. He 
                   never had to raise funds as a coach, never had to do 
anything 
                   but coach--and, well, fix the place up a bit. ""When I 
first got 
                   here in 1954, there was a broken-down old shack in the end 
                   zone,"" he says. ""Caretaker lived there. It took a few 
years, but 
                   we finally got it torn down."" He laughed at another 
                   recollection: He couldn't understand why fans refused to 
sit in 
                   an upper section of the stadium until he ventured up and 
                   realized that there were no bathrooms up there. 

                   Coach Royal doesn't much bother Dodds with advice anymore, 
though 
                   he did mention one thing a while back: ""I told him, 
'Nothing 
                   makes Texans as happy as winning, and it's happy folks 
that 
                   give.'"" Like any good executive, Dodds listened well.

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Roughly speaking if you use absorption chilling, you would save (at max 
summer conditions) maybe 1.2 MW per LM or about 2.5% on capacity which would 
be nominally a 2.5% improvement in heat rate. To get this you need a source 
of steam. For Lowell, we possibly could get steam from UAE (I don't know how 
the transaction would work). We would need about 180,000 lb/hr of steam at 
least at 15 psig. The chillers would cost about $400,000 total more than the 
mechanicals we have discussed.

If UAE can't supply the steam, then we would need small HRSG's behind each 
CTG and would most likely also try and steam injection for NOx control. Heat 
rate would improve by maybe 6-7%, plant net output would increase by maybe 2 
MW per LM. Capital cost would grow by maybe $8,000,000 (this is wild guess, 
we did get HRSG quotes for this steam injection/absorption version but have 
not done a detailed capex).

Hopefully the following points should answer your questions. Feel free to=
=20
call me (34292) if you still have any question.

Yvan




1_  We will value Teco as a series of hourly Spread options.=20
Legitimate points of concern:=20
a) Are we valuing an index deal or a physical deal?
  b) If it is a physical deal can the plant realistically react on an hourl=
y=20
basis?

Answer: The deal Enron enters into is based on an spread between PJM index=
=20
and the appropriate OIL curve (New York Harbor + basis). However, the trigg=
er=20
for the default of the contract (which is really what we are concerned with=
)=20
is a function of the plant cash flows compared to the debt level. The plant=
=20
cash flows depend on the physical operations of the plant and its capacity =
to=20
dispatch during the most expensive hours of the year. Therefore the questio=
n=20
of whether the plant can or cannot ramp up quickly enough to dispatch=20
economically is very pertinent to our valuation.=20
I would argue that the plant will always (or almost always) be able to=20
dispatch economically for the following 2 reasons. In the first place, its=
=20
operational ramp up time is only 10 minutes. Secondly, the scalar curve we=
=20
use is fairly well behaved and doesn=01,t swing around a mean position (see=
=20
graph below), hence allowing sufficient preparation for the dispatchers. Th=
e=20
chances of dispatchers being caught by surprise when prices spike up or dow=
n=20
should therefore be relatively small, and the plant should be able to follo=
w=20
the real time prices pretty well.





2_ The power curve we use is PJM west. Even though the plant is located in=
=20
the south east end of PJM (i.e. the del Marva peninsula), we prefer not to=
=20
use the east curve which is too thinly traded to be meaningful.=20

4_ So far we have only used monthly vol for power. Should we start using=20
daily vol as well, then the blending formula would be:
'fvol =3D Sqr((dblMvol * dblMvol * (jDate - jToday) + dblDvol * dblDvol * 1=
5) /=20
(jDate - jToday + 15))

with  jDate the first of the considered month of dispatch
 dblMvol the monthly vol
 dblDvol the daily vol

6_ We are assuming 50% flat correlation for 20 years (a much more=20
conservative assumption than 15%). However we run sensitivities where the=
=20
correlation goes from 30% to 70%.

7_ Yes, we are deducting all operative expenses from the valuation.=20
Origination is currently trying to reconcile the differences in operations=
=20
expenses between their numbers and those used by credits.

8_ The valuation model (coded by Alex Huang, Research) is based on a=20
bidimensional tree, and therefore doesn=01,t use the SPRDOPT function. Howe=
ver,=20
we checked that the SPRDOPT function from the structuring model and the tre=
e=20
based model yielded the same values for the spread option.

9_ The strike for the spread option is the sum of the OIL price + the VOM.

Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see=20
associated with the heat rate spread option.  I want to make sure that I=20
understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this val=
ue=20
would be booked.  As such, please provide the following detail:

Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of=
=20
daily call options?
What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to=
=20
value the deal?
What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities=
=20
or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me=
=20
what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th=
=20
of the relevant month, and for daily options?
What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
Are you using the ""SPRDOPT"" Exotic Options function to value the option?
Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?
Has Don provided the fixed payment stream?  This stream should be covering=
=20
both P&I and not just principal.

Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written=20
correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding. =
=20
Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.  Furthermore, I=
=20
would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserv=
e,=20
is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is=
=20
consistent among the internal groups; and (ii) the inherent value of the=20
price risk management contracts matches.  This enables RAC to manage the=20
associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and=20
appropriately.

Elizabeth, 

I am going to divide my presentation into two parts.  One is going to be designed to give the marketers ""talking points""  and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories. 

I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach. Unless you agree with and support this kind of ""How Enron views the WSPP"" policy, I shouldn't be advocating it at the meeting.   

Enron's view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end.  It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements.  Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other.  Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements, one that is almost like the other one.  Valuable resource time is being wasted.  Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements. 

 This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best:  provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function.  The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West, dealing with the emerging California changes, and open access in Oregon and Nevada.   Right now, the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center.  This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions. The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions. 

We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles.  Sales people do not want to feel alone and different.  They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales.  It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour d'Lane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such.  He wants to feel loved.  Therefore,  this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization,  but at the same time, advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects.  Rosman should say:  Enron loves the WSPP,  it has done a great job with the contract reformation,  that task is done,  we now should move on to bigger and better tasks.  Let's get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda.   

Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess.  Otherwise, we pit Enron's clearmindedness  against a stubborn mass of  inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result. 
The world, including our little western power world, is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational.  It is full of all of the conflicts of history, ambitious tirades, irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities.  The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon.  They are not going to go away.  Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy.  Praise them as we bury them on the contract front.  As our headquarters commander, I beg you to  let Steve and me, as field operatives,   pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months. We can wind these guys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday.   One consequence of the policy is that you would have to urge the EEI bureacracy to embrace a joint committee approach.

1167,"Due to the size of this possible transaction, I thought I would keep you in 
the loop on its status.

We submitted a bid with caveats as to its non-binding nature, and suggested 
an alternative structure.  In response, Navigant issued questions. John 
Llodra has compiled answers, which appear to be fine to me.

 We  (Legal) have been instructed to standby, awaiting commercial guidance as 
to whether we will be going forward.  I believe Klauberg has either cleared 
conflicts or initiated the process, so if we go forward, he should be our man.

I will let you know once a go/no go decision is reached.

1168,"I attach a draft dated 5/10/01 of a Two Way Cash and Letter of Credit Form of 
Credit Support Annex to be used with EEI Masters.  Because the Draft Annex is 
based on the form  used by the Swap Group, I have also attached a version 
marked to show changes from the Swap Group's form.

While preparing this I also reviewed the Credit Annex draft prepared by 
Morgan Stanley and Shari Stack's comments on it.  Unlike the MS draft, mine 
doesn't contemplate any kinds of collateral other than cash and letters of 
credit (which is what EAS wanted, I believe.)  In addition, Shari had posed 
the question of whether any defaults under the Credit Annex itself should be 
made Events of Default under the Master Agreement.  Although my initial 
reaction is that we should not add any such additional defaults under the 
Credit Annex as Events of Default, please think about this question as you 
review the draft.

I look forward to your comments.

1169,"Elizabeth, 
Carol and I had a  conversation (with Justin Boose mostly listening in) about 
how best to coordinate her much welcomed support for West Desk EEI deals and 
out of that conversation I would like to propose that we send the following 
message to Tim and the Mid-Marketers.  The message is designed to enforce a 
kind of teamwork discipline and approach to EEI work that Steve, Justin and 
me have been developing here.  Obviously the message will not be sent until 
you and Carol are happy with it, and my suggestion is that you, Elizabeth, 
should send the message.  

Mid-Marketers:
The legal team supporting West Desk Trading has been strengthened by the 
addition of Carol St. Clair of ENA's Houston legal department.  Carol is 
going to concentrate on negotiating high priority EEI Agreements.  We are 
trying to build an improved process  for supporting EEI negotiations that 
involves a teamwork approach among a team of lawyers working together  along 
the following lines.  The idea is to create a steady processing of all EEI 
agreements at one level,  while at the same time,  having the flexibility to 
keep our most experienced trading attorneys working on our highest EEI 
priorities at any given time. The highest priority EEI agreements will be 
those where we are trying to get new, long term business. 

Justin Boose of Stoel Rives will have the responsibility to drive Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 of the EEI process. 

Stage 1 is all internal steps required to send a Cover Sheet including credit 
terms to the Counterparty.  These steps will involve getting the credit work 
sheet from Credit to our paralegal, Genia Fitzgerald and getting the Cover 
Sheet including the credit terms from Genia, proofreading it and identifying 
who to send it to.  

Stage 2 is harassing the Counterparty and, in cooperation with Mid-Marketers, 
getting the right people from the CP  to look at our Cover Sheet and reply 
with comments.  

Christian and Carol will be primarily responsible for Stage 3 of the EEI 
process, with Steve Hall also involved in this stage from time to time as 
other priorities may permit.  

Stage 3 is driving  the negotiations from the completion of Stage 2 to 
closing. 

Pat Boyston will be asked to join Stage 3 to help address all muni issues and 
to close out other issues as well from time to time.  Eventually Justin will 
grow into providing Stage 3 support. 

The critical credit liaison function will be made by the responsible attorney 
as the process moves to completion, with Legal taking the responsibility to 
drive the overall process to completion. 

We believe this kind of disciplined approach by this team should provide an 
enhanced level of support for EEI negotiations day in and day out if 
everybody recognizes   who is expected to do what during the three Stages. 
Christian has the responsibility to see that either he or Carol or Steve are 
concentrating on the highest priority EEI negotiations at any given time. 

Support for EEI negotiations is only part of the legal work that must be done 
for the West Desk and prioritizing the other work will be handled by 
Christian and Steve, working with me in Houston.

1170,"Mike- 

As discussed, attached please find the agreement we currently use to document 
physical power transactions. It is the EEI Master Power Purchase and Sale 
Agreement and is comprised of boiler plate language  (see ""EEI Master (6) 
4-25-00"") and a Cover Sheet where the relevant elections are made (see ""EEI 
Master CS with Prior Transactions""). 

For your purposes, please look at Article 8 in the boilerplate as it sets 
forth the language regarding collateral requirements. I think you will be 
most interested in Articles 8.1(c) and 8.2 (c).  Then, in the Cover Sheet, 
look on p. 2 under Article 8. This is where the relevant threshold numbers, 
etc... are inserted. 

Please call me if you have any questions - I will be happy to help guide you 
through it.

This has been on my calendar for 2;30 for quite a while, but a note sent 
earlier this week (while I was out sick) says it should be 2:00 -- is that 
right?  I'm afraid that I've set up a conference call w/ 4 other people for 
1:30 and it can't be changed at this point.  So I'm probably not going to be 
available at 2:00.  I don't want to appear rude to Alice, so could you let 
her know?  And I have no paperwork on her yet -- should I have a resume or 
something?  And you should also note that my location has changed. I'm now in

1211,"Attached is the August 10, 2001 draft of the proposal to FERC regarding the
allocation methodology based on the latest comments from Lynn Miller.

As we discussed yesterday during the Official Committee conference call,
today I am circulating this draft to the Official Committee, the attorneys
for the Official Committee, the CalPX and the attorneys for the CalPX.  I
would like to receive all comments back from this group by Weds, August 15,
at which point I propose to circulate the draft to the Unofficial Energy
Sellers Group, and the Coral FERC litigation group that initiated the
proceedings that resulted in the April 6 order from FERC rescinding the
chargebacks issued by the CalPX through March 5.  PG&E also asked for an
advance opportunity to comment on the proposal, which we should consider
offering in light of PG&E's more cooperative approach.  I propose to allow
several days for comments from the broader distribution group, and propose
thereafter to file appropriate proceedings concurrently before FERC and the
CalPX bankruptcy court seeking approval of the proposal, as we have
discussed.  Approval from District Judge Moreno should  follow after the
bankruptcy court approval is obtained.

As soon as the Official Committee's attorneys have prepared drafts of the
moving papers that will be submitted to FERC and the bankruptcy court, we
will circulate copies to the members of the Official Committee for comments.

Please let me have your comments as soon as possible.  Thanks.

If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

OK Coaches and other concerned  people,
 
Here is the latest update on  reschedules.  But first, I apologize for trying to reschedule 4 games at  one field on one night.  This is the correction of that mess and most of  the other messes in the reschedule.  There are two games on the list that  have not been rescheduled yet but they are on the list to let you know that I  know that it needs to be done.
 
Now, what I need from you is scores that  have not been called in and I need future scores called in on time.  It's  getting late in the season I need information on a timely basis.  I don't  want to enforce the 24 hour rule, but some of you are waiting a week or  more.  After tomorrow, if you wait a week or more to call in a score you  will forfeit the game.  Please help me get this stuff done on time as we  come to the close of the season.  I am working hard to make it so we can  end on time, but I can't do it without some help.  Currently I am missing  scores for games 1212, 1229, 1235, 1236, 1237, 1238 and from teh Gray Div. 1067,  1070, 1100, 1136, 1141.  Thanks.

Now on to the business at hand.  Thought I'd let you see the last email 
exchange between Mr. Noble and myself.  Start from the bottom with my email 
and then read his response.  I would love to hear your insight on it all.

Here's my thought at this point.  I think Ted is an EXTREMELY linear person, 
in that his focus can not be split between too many different things at 
once.  To that end, I believe this project, to which he has dedicated many 
hours, has literally harnessed all of his attention.  Realizing this, I'm not 
sure exactly how I feel about it - - - Any thoughts?

For the purposes of margin, defining a business day as those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston will work.  For the purposes of error notification, we should remove ""business day"" and insert something along the lines of ""market day"" and define ""market day"" as any day that the market on which the contract traded is open.  There are a few days the markets are open but the banks are closed.   Will that work for you?

Both Morgan Stanley and Enron are registered with the NFA.  Is there a specific reason you can't agree to NFA arbitration?

Re:		NYMEX, CME Partner to Offer E-mini Energy Futures

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX), and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange Inc. (CME) today announced at a joint news conference in New York
that they have reached a cooperative agreement to offer newly created
""E-mini"" versions of key NYMEX energy futures contracts for trading on CME's
GLOBEX
 electronic trading platform and clearing at the NYMEX Clearing
House.

	The first E-mini energy contracts will begin trading in the summer,
officials of the exchanges said.

	The agreement calls for the two exchanges to launch smaller,
electronically traded versions of NYMEX's crude oil, natural gas, heating
oil and gasoline futures contracts.  Precious metals contracts may be
introduced in subsequent phases.  Modeled after CME's popular line of E-mini
stock index contracts, which are one-fifth the size of the standard-sized
contracts, the new E-mini energy and precious metals futures would be a
to-be-determined fraction of the size of the standard-sized NYMEX contracts.


	Under the cross-access program, CME members will be granted access
to GLOBEX to trade the E-mini versions of the energy futures products and to
NYMEX ACCESS* to trade NYMEX Division products listed on that system,
subject to the guarantee of a NYMEX clearing firm.  CME members who are not
members of NYMEX will receive discounts for these trades.  Similarly, NYMEX
members will receive access to GLOBEX and discounts on fees for CME products
traded on GLOBEX with a CME member firm guarantee, and for the E-mini energy
products with the guarantee of a NYMEX clearing firm.

	The Exchange officials said that a cross-margining program will
provide capital efficiencies for market professionals and proprietary
accounts by combining the positions at joint or affiliated clearing members
in baskets of CME and NYMEX or COMEX Division commodities, the new E-mini
energy products, and GSCI* futures and options into a single portfolio.  The
risk-based performance bond (margining) systems of each clearing
organization will then determine a single performance bond requirement
across both markets.

	Vincent Viola, NYMEX Chairman, said, ""This deal will bring our
successful energy products to a broad retail user base through the GLOBEX
distribution network, as well as expand the opportunities and cost
efficiencies for participants in both markets.""

 	""This is an innovative new development in the futures industry that
builds on the long-standing relationship between our exchanges,"" said CME
Chairman Scott Gordon.  ""With this cooperation agreement, we are blending
CME's successful E-mini concept, our GLOBEX infrastructure and global
distribution network with NYMEX's proven product line, established liquidity
and customer relationships in these markets.""

	NYMEX President J. Robert Collins, Jr., said, ""In 2002, we have seen
a 64% increase in natural gas futures over the same period last year, as
well as a 20% increase in overall energy futures trading.  By reducing the
size of the contract unit, we hope to emulate the CME's success in expanding
the trading community for our most liquid markets.""

	""Tremendous synergy has been developed between the open outcry and
electronic trading in our stock index markets since CME first introduced the
E-mini S&P 500 futures contract in 1997 and the E-mini Nasdaq-100 contract
in 1999,"" said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty.  ""By
expanding GLOBEX distribution to the NYMEX floor and leveraging our existing
distribution channels, we hope to build on our previous success, enhance
market liquidity and expand the customer base for energy and, potentially,
metals futures.""

	Unlike their standard-sized counterparts, the new E-mini products
will be cash-settled to the respective NYMEX futures contract month final
settlement price on the last day of trading.  Two contract months will trade
at any given time.

	GLOBEX is an open access electronic trading platform that displays
the ""book"" to any qualified market participant with the ability to route
orders to the system.  The book represents the ability to view bids and
offers in the market.  Under the agreement, market participants interested
in trading the new products will be designated ""qualified"" if they are
guaranteed by a NYMEX clearing member firm.  In addition, NYMEX members and
customers trading the new products on GLOBEX will have access to CME's
electronically traded products, subject to the guarantee of a CME clearing
firm.

	In addition to the extensive distribution network and connectivity
alternatives of GLOBEX, the exchanges will work together to provide NYMEX
members and customers with access to GLOBEX, both on the NYMEX trading floor
and around the world.  Points of access will include GLOBEX TraderSM-Direct
terminals placed on the NYMEX trading floor adjacent to the pit, enhancing
liquidity and providing trading opportunities similar to CME's E-mini equity
index complex on its trading floor.

	NYMEX and CME jointly developed CLEARING 21*, the clearing platform
operated at both exchanges for high-volume, high-capacity clearing and
settlement of exchange-based transactions. The system processes reported
trades and tracks positions continuously in real time, providing users with
instantaneous information on trades, positions and risk exposure.

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., (www.nymex.com) is a subsidiary of
NYMEX Holdings, Inc.  The Exchange is the world's largest physical
commodities exchange, and the preeminent global trading forum for energy,
and metals..  Products include crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, natural
gas, platinum, gold, silver, copper, and aluminum futures and options;
propane, coal, electricity, and palladium futures; and options on the
spreads between crude oil and heating oil and crude oil and gasoline. In
2001, its trading volume totaled more than 103 million contracts, with a
notional value of approximately $3.2 trillion. Overall Exchange volume
year-to-date is up 26 percent.

Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (www.cme.com) is the largest futures
exchange in the United States.  As an international marketplace, CME brings
together buyers and sellers on its trading floors and GLOBEX
around-the-clock electronic trading platform.  CME offers futures contracts
and options on futures primarily in four product areas:  interest rates,
stock indexes, foreign exchange and commodities.  CME pioneered the
E-mini concept with the September 1997 launch of E-mini S&P 500 futures and
options.  The exchange followed up in 1999 with E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures.
The two stock index futures contracts quickly became the fastest-growing
products in CME history.  The exchange moves about $1.5 billion per day in
settlement payments and manages $28.2 billion in collateral deposits.  CME
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc.

I think we may have this one done       ",Ya Hoo,,
1265,"Good news.  

ABN Amro told us yesterday that they want to pursue this line and have it 
closed by the end of the week.  They asked us to send them a copy of the 
documentation where it stands up to now.  They gave us a copy of their 
mark-up of the Corp Guarantee which I gave to all of you.  ABN is motivated 
to get this done and will be amenable on pricing.  

Bank One talked to Jeff Shankman last night and has agreed to an effective 
rate of 0 for the initial margin.  They will charge us FF+30 but will 
reimburse us at FF+30 for any cash margins (see Schedule 1.)  Also Bank One 
will charge $2.55 a side for the commission ($5.10 total.)  Jeff told Bank 
One that ENE recently decided to pay all of its brokers the same fee 
(explains discrepancy between documentation and commission quotes from 
trading floor.)  As for the variation margin, the charge will be FF+30.  Bank 
One has  documents:
Customer Agreement - amendments will be made to Schedule 1 to reflect newly 
proposed commercial terms.
Enron Corp. Guaranty - Bank One needs to discuss Joel's request for Enron 
standard documentation
Credit line document - Jason/Sara need to make any necessary comments
Master Note (Promissory note) - NY law/jurisdiction will be acceptable.  Bank 
One needs to discuss Joel's' request for standard Enron documentation.  

Let's get together today so that we can organise ourselves to get our 
comments to the docs consolidated and close these as quickly and efficiently 
as possible.

1288,"Continuing the track record of Republican telemarketing fraud during this 
campaign, it appears they have another one up their collective sleeves: a 
sleazy telemarketing call, usually from anonymous sources, falsely claiming 
to be calling on behalf of Democratic Headquarters and variously requesting 
contributions or Election Day volunteers.  The callers are often rude or 
abruptly hang up once challenged.

Please be aware these are not authorized calls.

While Jim wants to help voters, his adversaries appear bent on annoying and 
harassing them.

Help us bring this shameless and illegal practice to a halt.

Here's what you can do if you get a suspicious call:

1.  Pay attention to the pitch. If you have an answering machine, tape the 
conversation.  If not, write it down right away, before you forget, and send 
it to the McGreevey Legal Team by emailing to my address above.

2.  Don't stop the conversation or argue with the caller; get as much 
information as you can.   Try to get the callers' name, organization, 
location or any identifying details.

3.  Save any voice mails or answering machine tapes of the conversation. 
Check to see whether the caller registers on any caller ID devices.

4.  Provide us with your name, contact information (phone, email and mail 
address), including the phone line on which you received the call.  Tell us 
the best time and place to call you.

5.  Be sure to give us the date and time you got the call.

6.  Let us know your age and whether you are registered as a Democrat, 
Republican, or unaffiliated.  This will help us identify the universe to 
which they are calling.

Forward this email or fax it to your friends to let them know about this 
ruse and what they can do to stop it.

If they don't have email, have them write down the requested information and 
fax it to me at 732-404-0478.

Thanking you in advance on behalf of Jim and the entire McGreevey Democratic 
team.

Classes are well underway at MIT.  I wanted to thank you and Lou for your sponsorship and support - a process that I initiated nearly 2 years ago.  This is something I have always wanted to do and the one-year Sloan Fellows Program provided the right window at the right time in my career.  Having a year to concentrate on business study away from the daily rigors of deal making and quarterly earnings targets will allow me to build the skills and thought process necessary to get the most out of the opportunities I will face in the next 15 years of my career.

Schedules did not allow me to stop by your office for a proper thank you and goodbye but I want to be certain you appreciate my intentions after this program has concluded.  I fully intend and expect to return to Enron after the program is over (Summer 2002).  You and Enron have provided me with great opportunities and rewards over the last seven years - I want to continue that relationship.  I look forward to the business problems you will have for me when I return.

I would love for you to come to Cambridge and spend a few hours with our class.  We have a great story to tell.  Our business model and history of innovation is unique and a great lesson.  Perhaps we could coordinate your visit with a recruiting presentation at MIT or Harvard.  Let me know if you are interested and I will work with Sherri.

Thanks again Jeff

IN THE NEWS...
New Federal Initiative to Focus on Diabetes and Women
Of the estimated 16 million Americans with diabetes, more than half are women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The CDC recently launched its new three-phased initiative on women and diabetes.  The initiative, co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association,  the American Public Health Association (APHA) and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), will work to curb the recent rise in diabetes among women.

Eat Your Way to Better Health
The American Diabetes Association released new nutritional guidelines in the January, 2002 issue of Diabetes Care, the Association's journal of clinical research.  The new guidelines emphasize recent evidence that exercise and lifestyle choices can play major roles in managing and even preventing diabetes.  Other interesting studies in the January issue include research on how stress management can affect blood sugar and the annual costs diabetes expenses cost employers.

Overfeeding Rapidly Induces Leptin and Insulin Resistance
Hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia coexist in common forms of obesity. A team of researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York, recently demonstrated that overfeeding mice induces leptin and insulin resistance in test subjects.  The study, led by Dr. Luciano Rossetti, was published in the December, 2001 issue of the journal Diabetes.

A Few Sips a Day Could Cut Heart Disease Risk
Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health recently found that men with type 2 diabetes who consume moderate amounts of alcohol each day reduce their risk of heart disease.  Compared with nondrinkers, men who drank one-half to two drinks daily cut their heart disease risk by 36 percent, and men who drank more than two drinks a day had a 41 percent lower risk of heart problems.

2000. I hope these are what you're looking for.

",Carla - the Kate,,
1360,"Here's the latest -
The Short Term West Services desk bought power from Sierra Pacific Holding 
Co. for 4/29 and 4/30. Then, Bob Ellery, our contact there, called the Real 
Time desk and said they had lost a unit and needed to buy some of the power 
back from us. The deals are in our system as follows:

594854
EPMI buys Sierra Pac.
NP-15
4/29 - 45 mw round-the-clock
4/30 - 40 mw round-the-clock
$218 off peak
$328 on peak

595714
Short Term West Hourly sells Automated Power Exchange (Sierra's scheduling 
coordinator)
NP-15
4/29 - 19 mw round-the-clock
$228
(Total Value = $103,968)

Because Sierra's buy-back was in the Real Time market, we sold to their SC, 
not Sierra itself. Also, confirm letters don't go out on hour-ahead trades, 
which could be why you're running into some confusion. Let me know if this 
helps, and I'll continue to look for a deal flowing on 4/30. The Real Time 
group told me there was one, but it's only for the first 6 hours, not the 
whole day. 

I'll get back to you soon.

Finally, he has reviewed the Deemed ISDA and will have the same comments

is not the type of FINANCIAL deal that EWEB has contemplated (or authorized) 
and that it would require special board approval.  The Board meets on Dec. 
5.  He requested that a special provision be inserted into the confirm prior 
to that approval, stating that this transaction is NOT BINDING until approved

1385,"Mark/Peter - Enron Canada (""ECC"") is contemplating entering into physical 
transaction to supply power to Atlantic.  It is contempated to be a 3 year 
deal for 25-50 MWh and will be back to backed with the British Energy supply 
contract.  ENA currently has an existing pulp and paper swap with Atlantic 
which was done under an ENA/Atlantic ISDA.  Enron credit has reviewed 
Atlantic and has advised that in order for ECC to do the power deal it will 
need to put into place a master netting and collateral agreement.  I have 
reviewed a form of master netting and collateral agreement that ECC has used 
where there is a master physical and an ISDA between the same two parties but 
not where there are three parties.  Do either of you have such a three party 
form?  I was thinking we may have this in Houston to the extent we have 
entered into this type of arrangement in power deals (i.e. among EPMI, ENA 
and the counterparty).

This issues that arise in the current situation are complex given that:
Governing Law - the physical agreement will be governed by Ontario law and 
the ISDA is likely governed by New York Law.  the master netting agreement 
would likely be governed by Ontario law;
Sharing - there will need to be a concept of sharing/obligations between ENA 
and ECC (for all situations, both in the money, both out of the money and one 
of each);
Currencies - Not overly complex but will need to be addressed as betwee ENA 
and ECC as well as with the counterparty.


If either of you have any thoughts on the contemplated agreement please let 
me know.

note
the following changes:

References to ""Enron Corporation"" have been changed to ""Enron Corp.""

A termination right for the data portion of the transaction has been inserted 
in
the Order Form for data.

References to ""Distributor's Subsidiaries"" have been added in the license 
grant
in Section 4.1 of the T&C as well as in the indemnification section in Section
14 to extend the indemnification protection by Reuters to Distributor's
Subsidiaries.  Because of the wider scope of the license, a Section 16.10 has
been added to make clear that if any of Distributor's Subdiairies breach the
Agreement, Reuters will look to Enron Corp. rather than the individual
subsidiary.  The reason for this is that although Reuters acknowledges that
Enron's subsidiaries may be involved in operating the URLs, Reuters does not
want to be put in a situation in which it has to search for the relevant
subsidiary to remedy the breach.

Mark:
I hope the added language addresses your concern regarding the protection of
Enron's Affiliates and the ability of Affiliates to participate in the 
operation
of URLs.  Please call to discuss if necessary (646-298-9571).

One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look down and notice a unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Third-year Blue Devils head coach Carl Franks immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line. Practice was resumed when FBI special agents decided that the Blue Devils, winless in their last 22 games, would not be likely to encounter the substance ever, ever again.

     Barry: I will send a note to Jacy. Also the funds I think we will go 
     into are going to be more heavily weighted towards stocks, but will 
     have some bonds as well, that what makes them a balanced fund. Also, 
     do want us to manage the money Jacy has, or do you want to leave it 
     with him? No problem either way, just let me know.

1402,"We estimated 27,700 (including 3,000 for airfare for Enron people)
We spent 25, 096 (not including airfare or fishing or anything that was put on credit cards)

I will need to get an actual cost for the airfare and anything that was expensed to be able to give you a complete cost of the event.  I will contact Jessica to get this information from her.  I will then include it and send it back to you.

The bill has not been paid. As soon as I got it I put the list together for you.   I am sending it to accounts payable to get paid tomorrow.

I'll get everything to you as soon as I get it.

The following information and tips are provided to assist you as you're working with Outlook:

The Outlook mail file size restriction has been removed.  However, if you have ever submitted an eRequest for additional space, you will need to forward an email to the ETS Solution Center to have the email restriction lifted.

The steps listed below will allow you to turn off the Auto-Delete feature, so that your mail will not be deleted as you exit:
		Go to your inbox,
		Select tools,
		Select options,
		Select the ""other"" tab,
		Deselect the check box that says ""empty deleted items folder upon exit"".

You might want to consider creating a folder called 'Junk' or 'Undecided' for any non-business-related information or any retained items you don't want to clutter your normal folder structure.  

Regarding quarantined email messages:
Inbound - For inbound quarantined messages, a ticket needs to be opened with the Resolution Center, 713-853-1411.
If the intended email is of valid business-related content and you believe it requires Enron resources to retrieve it, the Help Desk will open a ticket to have the email released from quarantine and delivered to your e-mail Inbox. Your message will be scanned and checked for viruses prior to requested release.  If it contains a virus or there is reason to suspect it is malicious code, it will not be delivered.
