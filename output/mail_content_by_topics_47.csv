Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Thank you,

6,"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:

You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls
(or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete
this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we
found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our
users back on-line.

We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked
your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This
process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100
IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and
confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying
data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of
you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than
once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want
displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or
phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right
away.

To our IBS Billpayer clients:

During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill
payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring
payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our
highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the
process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this
information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the
months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence
(and support).

Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and
ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be
one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account
information, please refer to the following information:

1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was
the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed
to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or
contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is
the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you
online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you
receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for

WHY THE RIAA OWES US ALL AN APOLOGY

    When recording industry types last week tried
         to get provisions against music swappers
         included in anti-terrorism legislation,
         they trivialized everyone involved in America's
         fight against terrorism--and proved themselves
         to be absolutely the sort of people who'd do
         anything for a buck.

10,"Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same
level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You
say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I
just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost
was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we
can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90
per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the
true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.

Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There 
are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write 
something today.



Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start 
collecting.

puke is in the winter when 4th quarter production is 4-5% on y/y basis, 
demand still weak (economic weakness isn't a 3 month problem), industry 
realizes that not only is it ok to get to 500-700 bcf in march but you

I wanted to thank you for taking the time to interview me this past
Wednesday.  I enjoyed meeting you and other representatives of the company
and left our interview with a much greater understanding of what drives
Enron and what the company seeks in its applicants.  Your responses to my
questions only confirmed my already high opinion of the company.

As you know, I am a first year student at Owen concentrating in Finance and
Electronic Commerce.  I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Bentley College in
May of 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics & Finance, and I
received an Honors Certificate in Economics from the University of Cambridge
in August of 1995.

After graduating from Bentley, I worked for Digital Equipment Corporation as
an analyst in its Financial Development Program.  Most recently, I worked as
an investments analyst for Thomson Financial, where I evaluated three major
business development initiatives and five acquisition proposals totaling $44
million and worked with senior management on a takeover bid for one of
Thomson's key competitors.  I also performed strategic, market, and
competitor analysis, and proposed ways of improving the organization's
overall competitiveness.  My professional experiences working in the High
Technology and Financial Information Services industries have led to a
complete redefinition of my career goals.  I much prefer to be on the front
lines of business, helping some of the world's most established
organizations make decisions that will impact their financial future and
competitive position in the market.   I am anxious to begin my career with
Enron and believe that a relationship with company would prove mutually
beneficial.

In closing, I would like to thank you again for interviewing me in
Nashville.  If you have any questions, please contact via e-mail at

55,"As you are probably aware, the CPUC voted 5-0 to reject instituting retail 
rate caps in San Diego and instead adopted SDG&E's proposal to refund over 
$100 million.  The Commission also approved SCE and PG&E's motion to enter 
into bilateral agreements and schedule those transactions through the PX 
using the bilateral-option market.  These transactions will be confidential 
and will be disclosed only to the Commission's energy division, for purposes 
of reasonableness.  The Commission did not act upon San Diego's advice letter 
(#1242) to facilitate customer awareness of competitive alternatives.  That 
advice letter will not be acted upon until the next Commission meeting in 
September.

The Commission has also opened an investigation into the role of the utility 
as a default provider and will explore how the utility should pass along its 
costs to the customers.  It will also address whether SDG&E should be 
authorized to participate in bilateral contracts in addition to PX 
purchases.  It also opens the door to consider alternative exchange.  This is 
a fast track investigation, so I will set up a call to discuss early next 
week.

Sandi McCubbin and I were in Sacramento yesterday meeting with several of the 
key legislative offices.  There was also an interested party meeting (AB 1890 
Implementation Group).  From those meetings, it was apparent that Steve Peace 
is interested in legislation to institute rate caps in San Diego, re-vamp the 
governance structure of the ISO and PX boards, having market participants 
(generators, marketers, utilities) share in some of the pain that San Diego's 
consumers feel, extend the rate freeze, etc.  Although, most of the other 
legislative offices saw this proposal as a total morass.

The legislative offices that we met with, while interested in providing some 
political cover to DeDe Alpert (Senator from San Diego in a close political 
race), were not interested in pursuing sweeping changes to the current 
structure, although this could change.  However, it should be noted that DeDe 
Alpert said herself that she would introduce rate cap legislation in San 
Diego when the legislature reconvenes on August 7.  Most of the discussion 
with the other offices was on what can be done by next summer and focused on 
bringing on peaking plants and expanding demand responsive programs.

Sandi and Dave Parquet also met with John Stevens, of the Governor's Office.  
He stated that the Governor did not want any major changes to the current 
structure to come across his desk, but that the Governor needed our help in 
preventing such changes from getting there, otherwise he may be politically 
compelled to sign the legislation.  Sandi will send out more information 
later, she's having computer problems.

There will be a hearing next week of the Senate and Assembly Energy 
Committees on San Diego issues on August 10.

We, in GA, will keep you updated on developments. ","Sandi McCubbin Steve Peace

PG&E will not be allowed to enter into such contracts after the transition

73,"TO ALL ELECTION INTEGRITY INTERNET ACTIVISTS:

Keep it up! The Democratic leadership is feeling the heat.

It's only a matter of time before they're going to have to
back off on their support for Al Gore and join the call for
him to concede.

For example, I just read an article about a Democratic mayor
of El Cajon, California who switched his party affiliation
from Democrat to Republican because he didn't like the dirty
tactics Al Gore is using to attempt to overturn the election.

Mayor Mark Lewis, had this to say, ""Over 600,000 servicemen
and women gave their lives in this last century to ensure
American freedoms, including our fundamental right to vote.
It is a despicable act to deny these brave people this same
right. I can no longer consider myself a Democrat when the
leader of the Democratic Party, supported by other elected
Democrat officials take this position. This is the final
straw. I didn't leave my party - my party left me.""

It's great news to see that people who voted for Al Gore and
even elected officials from his own party breaking ranks.

And Mayor Lewis is absolutely right.  Disenfranchising the
military is as low as you sink.  As American citizens we owe
a debt of gratitude to the military.

The least we can do is defend their fundamental right to
vote.

I had offered to come and be there during your surgery.  Both you and Dad 
replied that it was not necessary because the surgery was not that serious 
and there was no timeframe on its completion.  You know that I love you and 
Dad very much, and that I do not have a favorite parent (if that was your 
implication with your last comment).

If you are unhappy with Jason's actions that is fine, but you have to 
remember that my brother and I are different people.  You cannot neccessarily 
associate his actions with mine.  Please take that into consideration.

any existing balances as well as new Purchases, Cash Advances and
Balance Transfers and become effective with your Billing Cycle that
ends on or after 8/1/01. These terms and conditions will be in
effect as long as your Account has a balance.

General
This NextCard(R) Account Agreement and Disclosure Statement
(""Agreement"") contains the terms and conditions which govern your
NextCard Visa(R) (or MasterCard(R)) Account (""Account"") which is
issued by NextBank, N.A., Phoenix, AZ.
	This Agreement includes this document and the terms provided in
the Supplemental Disclosure enclosed with this document and the
card carrier accompanying your Card, and any amendments thereto.
The Supplemental Disclosure includes your Account Annual Percentage
Rates. Please read this Agreement carefully, including the section
on Finance Charges, and keep it for your records.
	In this Agreement, the word ""Card"" means the credit card(s) issued
to you. The words ""you,"" ""your"" and ""yours"" refer to each person
who has been approved for this Account. The words ""we,"" ""our"" or
""us"" refer to NextBank, N.A., or its assignees. In addition, the
words ""Transaction Date"" refer to the date the goods or services
were purchased or the date the Cash Advance was made. The words
""Posting Date"" refer to the date that the charge was debited and/or
credited to your Account.
	By applying for this Account, you agree to the terms and
conditions provided in this Agreement, including the Supplemental
Disclosure. You agree to sign your Card as soon as you receive
it.

Liability
	You become bound by this Agreement when you use your Card or
Account. You are also bound by this Agreement for the use of your
Card or Account number by any person who has been given authority
by you to use your Card or Account number. If you authorize another
person to use your Card, such authority will extend until such time
as we have retrieved the Card or you have received the Card back.


Using Your Card and Account
	You may use your Card to purchase goods or services wherever your
Card is honored; you may also use your Account to initiate the
transfer of balances from other credit cards to your Account.
NextCard reserves the right, however, to refuse transactions
initiated by other credit card issuers or merchants at our
discretion.  You may obtain Cash Advances on your Card from
financial institutions and automated teller machines that accept
your Card. In addition, you may use Convenience Checks that we may
provide to you from time to time. These checks may not be used to
make payments on this or any other account with us.  Your Card and
Account may only be used for valid and lawful purposes. You may use
your Account for Balance Transfers, by which you pay off other
credit card outstanding balances. Balance Transfers may include
initial and promotional offers.	We have no responsibility for any
refusal to honor your Card or the Convenience Checks we provide,
nor for the retention of your Card by any financial institution or
merchant.

Promise to Pay
	You promise to pay the total amount of the Purchases, Cash
Advances and Balance Transfers made with your Card or Account. You
also promise to pay any Finance Charges or other charges described
herein; and any costs incurred by us in enforcing this Agreement,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs. ""Attorneys'
fees"" includes the cost to us of the services of our in-house
counsel.  If you close your account, you must notify us in writing
and must still pay all amounts you owe us and will be responsible
for any charges that you authorized prior to closing your account.
If there is a membership fee for your account, the fee will
continue to be charged, as permitted by law, until the account
balance has been paid in full.

Personal Identification Number
	After your Account is opened, we may issue you a Personal
Identification Number (""PIN"") which you may use with your Card to
obtain Cash Advances on your Account at any automated teller
machine in any system or network of which we are a member, or to
make purchases at any designated point of sale machine. You may use
your Card and PIN at an automated teller machine to obtain Cash
Advances of up to $300 per day, up to your available Credit Limit
for Cash Advances. There will be no charge for the issuance of a
PIN. (Other banks' automated teller machines may have lower Cash
Advance limits or may assess surcharges.)

Statements
	You can access your Account information and Statements online. In
addition, we will send or deliver to you a Statement at the end of
each billing period (intervals of approximately one month called
""Billing Cycles"") if there is a debit or credit balance on your
Account of $1 or more, or a balance on which a Finance Charge has
been assessed. Upon your request or approval, we may deliver your
statement electronically.

Payment
	All payments must be made in U.S. Dollars and delivered, or mailed
to us at the address shown on your Statement. Payments by check
must be drawn on a U.S. bank. Due to processing requirements, any
payment we receive after 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time will be considered
received the following business day.  You must pay at least the
Minimum Payment Due shown on your Statement by the Payment Due Date
- approximately 20 to 25 days after the Statement Closing Date - to
avoid delinquency. If your payment is more than the Minimum Payment
Due, it will be treated as a single payment and none of it will be
applied to future Minimum Payments Due. We may apply payments to
amounts owing on your Account at our sole discretion and are not
required to do so in a manner that reduces the Finance Charges you
must pay. Payments may also be made via the NextCard online bill
payment system. For details on using the NextCard online bill
payment feature, please go to My.NextCard.com.
	For information regarding your Minimum Payment Due each month, see
the Supplemental Disclosure to this Account Agreement.

Credit Limit
	The total amount of Cash Advances (including drafts, if available,
withdrawals from ATMs, originations from the Card itself, and
cash-like transactions, including but not limited to, wire
transfers, money orders, foreign currency, lottery tickets, funds
used for wagers or gambling, and money transfers using certain
internet payment systems, and this includes all transactions
identified to us as having been made by a merchant or service
provider in such categories) you can receive at any time is shown
on your monthly statements and is designated as your ""Total Credit
Limit for Cash Advances"". You agree not to permit your unpaid Cash
Advance balance to exceed this limit. If you currently exceed, or
once you reach this limit, you will not be eligible for additional
Cash Advances until your unpaid Cash Advance balance is below this
limit. At this time, you may access the amount of the difference
between your unpaid Cash Advance balance and your Cash Advance
Credit Limit.  We may change your Cash Advance Credit Limit at any
time, and we will notify you of any such change. We reserve the
right to delay increasing your available credit for up to 14 days
if we consider it necessary to verify payments received on your
Account.  This change will not affect how promptly payments are
posted to your Account for purposes of determining Finance Charges,
late fees or delinquency.

FINANCE CHARGES
	The types of Finance Charges that may be assessed on your Account
are as follows:  Periodic Finance Charges; Transaction Finance
Charges; Annual Membership Fee Finance Charges; Rewards Fee Finance
Charges; and PictureCard Fee Finance Charges. Your total Finance
Charge each Billing Cycle is the sum of each type of Finance
Charges.
	We calculate Periodic Finance Charges separately for Purchases,
Cash Advances and Balance Transfers. To determine the Periodic
Finance Charge, we apply the Daily Periodic Rates for Purchases,
Cash Advances and Balance Transfers to the daily balance of
Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance Transfers. The sum of these
daily calculations for each day in the Billing Cycle is the total
Periodic Finance Charge for the Billing Cycle. The Daily Periodic
Rates for your Account are the corresponding Annual Percentage
Rates that currently may apply divided by 365.
	To determine your daily balance of Purchases, Cash Advances and
Balance Transfers we start with the outstanding balance at the
beginning of the day including any Periodic Finance Charges
calculated on the previous day's balance, add any new Purchases,
Cash Advances and Balance Transfers or other debits for the day and
then subtract any payments or credits applied to Purchases, Cash
Advances and Balance Transfers that day. This gives us the separate
daily balances for Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance
Transfers.
	Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance Transfers are included in
your daily balances as of either the transaction date or the
beginning of the Billing Cycle in which they are posted to your
Account, whichever is later.
	Periodic Finance Charges for Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance
Transfers for a day are added to the daily balances of Purchases,
Cash Advances and Balance Transfers at the end of the day and
included in the beginning balances for the next day.
Other Charges, Annual Membership Fee Finance Charges, Rewards Fee
Finance Charges and PictureCard Fee Finance Charges are added to
the daily balance of Purchases when posted. Transaction Finance
Charges are added to the daily balance of Cash Advances when
posted.
	For each Cash Advance transaction, including but not limited to,
each Cash Advance obtained through a financial institution or ATM,
or each cash-like transaction, such as the purchase of wire
transfers, money orders, travelers checks, lottery tickets, funds
used for wagers or gambling, and money transfers using internet
payment systems, and this includes all transactions identified to
us as having been made by a merchant or service provider in such
categories, we may assess a Transaction Finance Charge equal to 3%
of the amount of the advance, but not less than $5.00.  A
Transaction Finance Charge is included in the calculation of the
Annual Percentage Rate shown on your Statement; therefore, for any
Billing Cycle in which you have drawn a Cash Advance or used a
Convenience Check, the Annual Percentage Rate that will appear on
your Statement may be higher than the Annual Percentage Rate
described in the disclosures provided to you.
	NextCard offers optional Rewards Programs and an optional
PictureCardSM Program. Refer to the Supplemental Disclosure for
details regarding these programs.
	In any Billing Cycle in which there is a Finance Charge, the
minimum Finance Charge will be $1.00.

Grace Period
	Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance Transfers accrue Periodic
Finance Charges from the date they are included in your Daily
Balance until paid. However, Periodic Finance Charges are not
assessed in a Billing Cycle on Purchases if you paid in full the
New Balance, if any, shown on your previous statement by the
Payment Due Date shown on that statement or if that New Balance was
a zero or credit balance.

Other Charges
	Your Account also has the following other fees and charges (""Other
Charges""):
	There may be an Annual Fee on your Account. Refer to the
Supplemental Disclosure for details regarding the Annual Fee.
	Late Fee: We will add a fee in the amount shown in the
Supplemental Disclosure to this Agreement to the balance on your
Account for each Billing Cycle you fail to make the Minimum Payment
Due by the Payment Due Date.
	Overlimit Fee: We will add a fee in the amount shown in the
Supplemental Disclosure to this Agreement to the balance on your
Account any time you exceed your Total Credit Limit during a
Billing Cycle.
	Returned Payment Fee: You agree to pay $29.00 for each check,
draft or automatic payment (""Payment Order"") issued by you as a
payment on your Account which fails to clear and is returned
unsatisfied by your financial institution. We may post this charge
to your Account even if we re-present your Payment Order, and even
if the Payment Order is paid upon re-presentment.
	Document Retrieval Fee: If a copy of any statement, sales draft or
similar document is provided by us at your request (except in
connection with a billing error inquiry or dispute), we may charge
$5.00 for each document copy and a research fee of $15 per hour if
extensive investigation is required.

Authorized Users
	You may request and, at our discretion, we may provide an
additional Card on this Account for use by an individual you
authorize (""Authorized User""). You may also make a single request
for a new Card (""Replacement Card"") for you or an Authorized User
on this Account. In addition, we may periodically send you
substitute Card(s) for your use. Cards issued in any of these ways
are not subject to service charges. However, if you have previously
requested a single Replacement Card, we may charge a Card
Replacement Fee of $15 for any additional Card(s) you request.

Default and Immediate Payment
	You will be in default and we can require immediate payment of all
amounts you owe if:  you provide inaccurate or incomplete
information when you apply for your Account or thereafter; you fail
to make the Minimum Payment Due on your Account by the Payment Due
Date; your balance amount exceeds your Credit Limit; your
outstanding Cash Advance Balance exceeds your Cash Advance Credit
Limit, if applicable; you fail to pay your other debts or
obligations; you fail to abide by any term or condition of this
Agreement; we believe, in good faith, that you may not be able to
meet the obligations of this Agreement; or, upon your death. If you
are in default or we have reason to doubt your creditworthiness
(for example, you have a returned payment for any reason) we may,
without notice or demand for payment, terminate your right to
obtain any additional credit.  You also agree to notify us promptly
upon any change in name, address (including phone number), employer
(including phone number), or email.

Termination
	We may suspend or terminate your rights to obtain credit at any
time for any reason. Your obligations under this Agreement will
continue even after your rights to obtain credit have been
suspended or terminated.

Not Secured Credit
	Your Account is not secured credit. We have no security interest
in any transaction you make with this Card, regardless of any other
agreement you may have with us.

Foreign Currencies
	Depending on whether your Card is a Visa or MasterCard, if you
charge a transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be
converted into a U.S. dollar amount by Visa or MasterCard based on
their operating procedures and regulations. Generally, currency
conversions are made using either a government-mandated rate or
wholesale market rate in effect one day prior to the Processing
Date, increased by an adjustment factor established from time to
time by Visa or MasterCard. We increase this currency conversion
rate by 2%. The currency conversion rate in effect on the
Processing Date may differ from the rate in effect on the
Transaction Date or the Posting Date. Additionally, for any Card
transaction which occurs (regardless of where you initiate the
transaction) in U.S. dollars outside the United States, we will add
a fee of 2% of the amount of the transaction, but not less than
$3.00.

Unauthorized Use
	You must contact us immediately at 1-877-744-4417 (from overseas,
you may call us at 1-918-497-1629) if your Card is lost or stolen
or if you suspect unauthorized use of your Account. We may
investigate any cases of unauthorized use of your Card or Account.

Dispute Resolution
	IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ THIS ENTIRE SECTION CAREFULLY.  THIS
SECTION PROVIDES FOR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES THROUGH FINAL AND
BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A
COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY OR THROUGH A CLASS ACTION.

The Dispute Resolution Provision will become effective for disputes
which are not part of a lawsuit 45 calendar days after the
Statement Date on the enclosed billing statement (the 65th day if
you live in Iowa*, the 95th day if you live in Wisconsin, or the
130th day if you live in Texas), unless we receive prior to then a
letter from you stating that you do not want the Dispute Resolution
provision to become part of the Agreement.  The letter must be
addressed to NextCard, P.O. Box 60610, Phoenix, AZ 85082-0610.  It
must contain your name, address and your Account number. It must be
signed by you.  If we receive such a letter on time, the Dispute
Resolution provision will not become part of the Agreement, and the
status of your Account will be unaffected by your rejection of the
Dispute Resolution provision.

*SPECIAL NOTICE FOR IOWA RESIDENTS:  The Dispute Resolution
Provision
will only become effective for disputes which are not part of a
lawsuit if you use your Account at least sixty five(65)calendar
days after the Statement Date on the enclosed billing statement.""


THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION SET FORTH IN YOUR ACCOUNT
AGREEMENT MAY SUBSTANTIALLY LIMIT OR AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS.  PLEASE
READ IT CAREFULLY AND KEEP IT FOR YOUR RECORDS.

*SPECIAL NOTICE FOR IOWA RESIDENTS:  The Dispute Resolution
Provision will only become effective if you use your Account at
least sixty five (65)calendar days after the Statement Date on the

BINDING ARBITRATION.  Arbitration is a method of deciding disputes
outside the court system.  This Provision governs when and how any
disputes you and we may have will be arbitrated instead of decided
in court.  The arbitration process established by this section is
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (""FAA"") (9 U.S.C. Sections
1 and following).  You have the right to take any dispute that
qualifies to small claims court rather than to arbitration.  All
other disputes (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
misrepresentation or any other legal or equitable theory) arising
out of or related to this Agreement, including  events leading up
to you becoming an Account holder and disputes about whether this
Provision is valid or binding or about whether or when the
Provision applies and disputes about wrongful acts of every kind,
must be resolved by final and binding arbitration.  This includes
any dispute based on any product, service, or advertising having a
connection with this Agreement and any dispute not finally resolved
by a small claims court.

The arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator using the
procedures described in this Provision.  The arbitration of any
dispute involving $10,000 or less shall be conducted in accordance
with the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association (""AAA""), as modified by this Agreement, which are in
effect on the date a dispute is submitted to the AAA.  The AAA's
Commercial Arbitration Rules and fee schedules will apply to any
disputes in excess of $10,000.  The arbitrator shall not apply
federal, state, or local rules of procedure and evidence or state
or local laws concerning arbitration proceedings.  The arbitrator
must follow the FAA, the substantive law, statutes of limitations
and claims of privilege recognized at law.  You have the right to
be represented by counsel in an arbitration.  In making an award,
the arbitrator shall be bound by and strictly enforce the terms of
this Agreement and may not limit, expand, or otherwise modify its
terms.  The arbitrator shall be a lawyer with more than ten years
experience or a retired or former judge.  Our address for service
of process under this Provision is NextCard, P.O. Box 60610,
Phoenix, AZ 85082-0610.

NO DISPUTE MAY BE JOINED WITH ANOTHER LAWSUIT, OR IN AN ARBITRATION
WITH A DISPUTE OF ANY OTHER PERSON, OR RESOLVED ON A CLASS OR
REPRESENTATIVE (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL) BASIS.  THE
ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD DAMAGES THAT ARE NOT EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED
BY THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT AWARD PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR ATTORNEYS'
FEES UNLESS SUCH DAMAGES ARE EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED BY A STATUTE.
YOU AND NEXTCARD BOTH WAIVE ANY CLAIMS FOR AN AWARD OF DAMAGES THAT
ARE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

ARBITRATION PROCEDURES.  Before you take disputes to arbitration or
small claims court, you must first contact our customer account
representatives at the number on your account statement or write to
us at NextCard, P.O. Box 60610, Phoenix, AZ 85082-0610 and give us
an opportunity to resolve the dispute.  Similarly, before NextCard
takes a dispute to arbitration, we must first attempt to resolve it
by contacting you.  If the dispute cannot be satisfactorily
resolved within sixty days from the date you or NextCard is
notified by the other of the dispute, then either party may contact
the AAA in writing at 335 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017 and
request arbitration of the dispute.  Information about the
arbitration process and the AAA's Arbitration Rules and its fees
are available from the AAA on the internet at www.adr.org.

The arbitration will be based only on the written submission of the
parties and the documents submitted to the AAA relating to the
dispute, unless either party requests that the arbitration be
conducted using the AAA's telephonic, on-line or in-person
procedures.  Additional charges may apply for these procedures.
Any in-person arbitration will be conducted at a location that the
AAA selects in the state of your primary residence.  A party who
has asserted a dispute in a lawsuit may still elect arbitration for
any part or all of the dispute that is asserted in the lawsuit.
All doubts about whether to arbitrate all or any part of a dispute
shall be resolved in favor of arbitration.  The arbitrator shall
apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and
provide written reasoned findings of fact and conclusions of law.
The arbitrator's award shall not be subject to appeal except as
permitted by the FAA.  Judgment on the award may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction.  Any arbitration shall remain
confidential.  Neither you nor NextCard may disclose the existence,
content, or results of any arbitration or award, except as may be
required by law, or to confirm or enforce an award.

ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
MUST BE BROUGHT WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER THE DATE THE BASIS FOR THE
CLAIM OR DISPUTE FIRST ARISES.

FEES AND EXPENSES OF ARBITRATION.  You must pay the applicable AAA
filing fee when you submit your written request for arbitration to
the AAA.  The AAA's filing fee and administrative expenses for a
document arbitration will be allocated according to the AAA's
Rules.  On any dispute you file, you will pay at least $50 of the
filing fee.  If you cannot afford to pay the fees charged by the
AAA and the arbitrator or if you believe that such fees are too
high, we will consider any reasonable written request by you to pay
the fees.  If you elect an arbitration process other than a
document (or ""desk"") arbitration, you must pay your allocated share
of any higher administrative fees and costs for the process you
select.  We will pay any fees or expenses we are required to pay by
law.  Each party must bear the expense of that party's attorneys,
experts and witnesses, regardless of who wins the arbitration,
except to the extent that applicable law or the AAA's Rules provide
otherwise.  The prevailing party, however, may seek to recover
AAA's fees and the expenses of the arbitrator from the other party.


MISCELLANEOUS.  This arbitration Provision shall survive any
suspension or termination of your Account, as well as the repayment
of all amounts borrowed under this Agreement.  If there is any
conflict or inconsistency between this Provision and the AAA's
Rules or other Provisions of this Agreement, this Provision will
govern.  If any portion of this Dispute Resolution is determined to
be unenforceable, the remainder shall, nevertheless, remain
enforceable.

Governing Law
	This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Arizona and
by any applicable federal laws no matter where you live. You agree
that any litigation brought by you against us regarding this
Account or this Agreement shall be brought in a state or federal
court located in the State of Arizona. If any part of this
Agreement is found to be invalid, the rest remains effective.

General Information
	No delay or failure in enforcing our rights under this Agreement
will prejudice any of our rights hereunder. If you default, unless
prohibited by applicable law, we may require you to pay all
collection costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court
costs. Our failure to exercise any of our rights when you default
or exercise other of our rights does not mean that we are unable to
exercise those rights upon later default or otherwise.

Payments Marked ""Paid In Full""
	We may accept letters, checks or other types of payments showing
""payment in full"" or using other language to indicate satisfaction
of your debt, without waiving any of our rights to receive full
payment under this Agreement. Satisfaction of your debt for less
than the full amount requires a written agreement, signed by one of
our authorized employees.


YOUR BILLING RIGHTS:  KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE

This notice contains important information about your rights and
our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

Notify Us in Cases of Billing Errors or Questions about Your
Statement. If you think your Statement is wrong, or you need more
information about a transaction on your Statement, write us at:
P.O. Box 62648, Phoenix, AZ  85082-9962

Write us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than
60 days after we sent you the first Statement on which the error or
problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not
preserve your rights. In your letter, give us the following
information:

*Your name and account number.

*The dollar amount of the suspected error.

*Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there
is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you
are not sure about.

If you have authorized us to pay your credit card bill
automatically from your savings or checking account, you can stop
the payment on any amount you think is wrong. To stop the payment
your letter must reach us three business days before the automatic
payment is scheduled to occur.

Your Rights and Our Responsibilities after We Receive Your Written
Notice. We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we
have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either
correct the error or explain why we believe your Statement was
correct.
	After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount
you question, or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill
you for the amount you question, including Finance Charges, and we
can apply any unpaid amount against your Credit Limit. You do not
have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but
you are still obligated to pay the parts of your Statement that are
not in question.
	If we find that we made a mistake on your Statement, you will not
have to pay any Finance Charges related to the questioned amount.
If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay Finance Charges,
and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned
amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount
you owe and the date that it is due.
	If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report
you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you
and you write to us within ten days telling us that you still
refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a
question about your Statement. And, we must tell you the name of
anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to
that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is.
	If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50
of the questioned amount, even if your Statement was correct.

Special Rule for Credit Card Purchases. If you have a problem with
the quality of property or services that you purchased with your
Card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with
the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining
amount due on the property or services. There are two limitations
on this right:

*You must have made the purchase in your home state or, if not
within your home state, within 100 miles of your current mailing
address; and

*The purchase price must have been more than $50.

These limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant,
or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or
services.




Important Notice Regarding Your NextCard Account

Effective with your Billing Cycle dated after August 15, 2001, your
NextCard Account Agreement is being amended to include the
following changes to your Terms and Conditions outlined below.

The Annual Percentage Rate for Purchases and Balance Transfers is a
variable rate equal to the Prime Rate plus a margin of 15.99%, but
in any event, not less than 22.99% (Daily Periodic Rate of
0.06298%), or Prime Rate plus a margin of 16.99% for Delinquent
Accounts, but in any event, not less than 23.99% (Daily Periodic
Rate of 0.06573%), Prime Rate plus a margin of 20.99% for
Derogatory Accounts, but in any event, not less than 27.99% (Daily
Periodic Rate of 0.07668%), and a fixed rate of 29.99% (Daily
Periodic Rate of 0.08216%) for Seriously Delinquent Accounts. The
APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers after you close your
Account is variable rate equal to the maximum of Prime Rate plus a
margin of 12.99% or your Annual Percentage Rate for Purchases and
Balance Transfer,  but in any event, not less than 19.99% (Daily
Periodic Rate of 0.05476%). For a ""Cured"" Account, the APR for
Purchases and Balance Transfers is a variable rate equal to the
Prime Rate plus a margin of 15.99%, but in any event, not less than
22.99% (Daily Periodic Rate of 0.06298%). These variable rates were
in effect on June 1, 2001.

The Annual Percentage Rate for Cash Advance is a variable rate
equal to the maximum of the Prime Rate plus a margin of 17.99% or
your Annual Percentage Rate for Purchases and Balance Transfer, but
in any event, not less than 24.99% (Daily Periodic Rate of
0.06846%).

In this Supplemental Disclosure Statement the term ""Prime Rate"", as
used for any Billing Cycle, is the highest Prime Rate published in
the Money Rate Tables of The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition)
on the first business day of the calendar month in which the
Billing Cycle ends.  Changes in the Prime Rate will take effect on
the first day of your Billing Cycle. If the Prime Rate increases,
so will the Daily Periodic Rate, your Periodic Finance Charges, and
your Annual Percentage Rate. If more than one Prime Rate is
published, the highest Prime Rate will be used for this
calculation. If The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition) fails to
publish the Prime Rate for the relevant date, we will use the Prime
Rate published in The New York Times or any other newspaper of
national circulation selected by us. The Prime Rate is merely a
reference rate and may not be the lowest rate available.

The Daily Periodic Rates used in determining Finance Charges and
corresponding APR may change each month as the Prime Rate changes.
Any increase or decrease in your Daily Periodic Rates will apply to
both the outstanding balance of your Account and new charges. The
Daily Periodic Rates will continue to vary even if your Account is
closed. The Daily Periodic Rate is the APR divided by 365.

Your Account is Delinquent if payment is received late or is
returned or the Account is overlimit; Derogatory if, in any
12-month period, the Account is Delinquent twice; and Seriously
Delinquent if you fail to make at least the Minimum Payment Due for
two consecutive Billing Cycles.  Accounts are no longer Derogatory
or Delinquent if no late or returned payment occurs and the Account
is not overlimit for 12 consecutive months (a ""Cured Account"").

Minimum Payment
The Minimum Payment Due for each Billing Cycle will normally be: 2%
of the Balance shown on your statement (or may be higher to ensure
that it is sufficient to pay the Finance Charges) plus the amount
of any Past Due Amount and the amount by which the Balance exceeds
your credit limit.  This payment will not be less than $15 or your
total Balance.

These changes apply to outstanding balances for Purchases and
Balance Transfers on the effective date and new transactions.

142,"Due to the 4th of July holiday, we have an unusual quarter-end situation on 
our hands.   Here are some of the facts:

Enron in Houston is closed on both Monday and Tuesday, July 3rd and 4th.  
The NYMEX is closed both days as well.  
Equity markets are closed on Tuesday, July 4th but are open on Monday, July 
3rd.  
Enron Europe is open for business on both days.
Technically, the first work day following the month-end is Wednesday, July 
5th for the Houston office.

Given the facts above, the following will be the month-end process:

QUARTER-END PROCESS:
Final quarter-end information is due to my team by 5 PM on Wednesday, July 
5th.  
No adjustments < $250,000 will be processed after 5 PM on Wednesday.
Adjustments > $250,000 require approval from John Lavorato or John Sherriff.
A final DPR for the quarter ended June 30, 2000 will be issued by 
approximately noon on Thursday, July 6.

JULY DPR REPORTING:
NO DPR will be issued dated July 3, 2000.
For divisions reporting P&L for July 3rd and/or July 4th, a ""Special DPR"" 
will be issued on July 5th.  This ""Special DPR"" will not have a year-to-date 
column.  This is due to the fact that quarter-end information will not be 
completed prior to issuing the ""Special DPR"".    For consolidated DPR 
purposes, July 3rd and July 4th will be combined and reported as one day.  
These combined days will be reported as July 4th.  Please report each of 
these days separately.  Once the final quarter-end DPR is completed, the 
regular DPRs for July business will be updated and reported, replacing any 
""Special DPRs"" previously reported.  This process is necessary to enable 
reporting of current daily information until the final quarter-end DPR is 
finalized.

Please contact me at extension 35242 or Chris Abel at extension 33102 if you 
have any questions.  As always, your cooperation in executing this month-end 
process is greatly appreciated",John Lavorato John Sherriff Chris Abel,"250,000 > $250,000",Enron NYMEX P&L

thoughts, and truthfully didn't hear back from anyone and didn't follow up.  
Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by 
AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who 
led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover 
gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study 
itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.  
Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the 
questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very 
useful.  

I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for 
passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the 
person that has contacted you.  Just let me know his/her name and number and 
I will follow through on that if you would like.

This note and an earlier email ( forwarded separately ) highlights issues 
around some transactions originated within Metals that arose due to 
'misunderstanding' of limits - which was work in progress for Andrew 
Cornfield ( Risk ), Lloyd Fleming ( RAC ) and Shane Dallman ( FX desk  - 
reporting to Gary Hickerson ) working with the Metal Commercial MDs on the 
subject of an exemption from Corp policy for IR and FX hedging.

It is pleasing that people in the control environment picked up the issues on

Hey,

I tried not to bother you today. Spent today working on the EBS Q4 & 2002 Action Plan and the Cash Flow Forecast and generally catching up. I spoke with DiMichele & Racicot and also and got a general update. I guess things look pretty bleak.

Just one point - being that I'm 5,000 miles from home (UK) with family & kids in school - I'd obviously appreciate as much notice as possible on any implications for myself - I know that may be tough, given the pace of change around here - but bear it in mind if you can.

 I tried to get on your calendar but you are busy this week so I decide to 
send you a very important e-mail. You told me to contact you if I was ever 
considering leaving my current job so I am doing so at this time. I want to 
say that I have thoroughly enjoyed working with you and you are the most 
impressive employee at Enron at any level. I feel comfortable speaking with 
you and appreciate all of your advice. I am not totally unhappy with the 
recruiting part of my job, I just feel that I do not ""buy into"" everything 
that is happening in my group. There are many necessary changes that are 
needed and I feel that the program is heading in an excellent direction. I 
just want to get into more of a sales oriented part of Enron because I feel 
that my strength is selling. I would like to at least get an interview with 
Enron Broadband because I know that they are filling up there retail sales 
groups. Although I do not have all the technical experience, I know people 
who have gone over there with no technical or no sales experience. As you 
know, it is who you know and I do not have a relationship with David Cox or 
any of the
retail folks in broadband. I was hoping that you would give David a call and 
see if he could at least give me an interview in one of the retail groups. 
Brent has called over to David and I feel if you were to call also, it would 
help.
 Sally, let me know if this will be ok and I would like to get on your 
calendar to discuss further. Nobody in my group knows that I am looking for 
another job so please keep this confidential. I can not tell  how much I 
value your opinion and advice in matters especially  like these. Thank you so 
much and I look forward 
to hearing from you soon.

166,"We are currently in the process of creating a website for each of the book 
administrators to maintain the Active/Inactive status of their books.  This 
website will also will allow the book administrators to check their post id's 
against active books.  All books will be identified by book administrator and 
trading group.  The attached spreadsheet lists every book in RisktRAC, 
provides what we currently believe the status (Active/Inactive) to be for 
most books and some commodity codes associated with those books.  
Additionally, there are two columns for book administrators and trading 
groups, which are both empty.  

In order for us to load the website with the most accurate data, we need for 
each of you, as heads of your respective groups, to identify which books 
belong to your book administrators and update the respective fields 
associated with those books.  Refer to the following rules for updating 
certain fields:

1)The book status should be Active, Inactive or Archive.  If a book has any 
deals/positions that should be officialized, might affect VAR, and/or might 
affect credit exposure then the book should have an Active status.  If the 
book has no deals/positions, but the intent is to use the book sometime in 
the near future, then the book should have an Inactive status.   If there are 
no plans to continue using the book then it should have an Archive status.  
Periodically, books marked as Archive will be removed from the website and 
archived.  A request can be made to the Risk Controls group to have the book 
unarchived and placed back on the website.  
Any books that do not have a status updated will default to Active.  Any new 
books set up and placed on the website will default to Active.

2)The Last Officialized and Commodity Code columns are provided to help you 
and your group identify which books are yours and the book's status.

3)The Trading Group column should have your name next to each of the books 
that your book administrators own.  This will allow you to query all books in 
your trading group to check if all active books have post id's or if an 
inactive book has a post id.

4)The Book Administrator column should have the name of the Book 
Administrator responsible for the book.  This will allow you and the Book 
Administrator to look at individual Book Administrator's books and post id's.

Once this website is up and running, each Book Administrator will be required 
to update the Status of each of their books on a daily basis and the Book 
Administrator on an as needed basis.  All of these changes will be made 
directly on the website.  

We are trying to get this process in place as quickly as possible, so please 
return this information at your earliest convenience to my attention.  You 
may call me at x33102 with any questions.

Thanks,

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

questions.  I have left Mike Bodnar and John Buchanan a phone mail message

storage and determine what changes need to be made.

One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is to
be able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.  ie, if we are
allocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.  If we are allocating
withdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.  Mike Bodnar will

191,"Here are some thoughs on how we would account for the Offsystem Storage.

Facts
NNG moves 100,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.
I will look into Form 2 physical reporting changes.

Offsystem inventory is reduced  2,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction.

Case 1	In-Kind is replaced by simple purchase from 3rd party, NNG incurrs the cost.
Debit 803 (Gas Purchases) or 858 (Fuel exp)		2,000 * cost of gas
	Credit A/P						2,000 * cost of gas

Case 1 books all transactions outside of operational storage.  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.


Case 2	In-kind is replaced by Operational Storage, NNG incurrs the cost
Debit 816 (Storage Fuel exp)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 812 (Storage Fuel Credit)		2,000 * MIP

Debit 808 (Storage Withdrawal)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 1174 (Encroachment)		2,000 * MIP

Case 3	In-kind is replaced by Operational Storage, Tracker incurrs the cost
Debit 816 (Storage Fuel exp)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 812 (Storage Fuel Credit)		2,000 * MIP

Debit 808 (Storage Withdrawal)		2,000 * MIP

The monthly update will be emailed to the personal email address of each department head or their designee.  This update should be stored on a personal computer until the next monthly update is received.

Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions today announced that it has formed a strategic alliance with The Risk Data Bank of Japan Limited (RDB), a leading provider of credit risk data, to jointly develop the first advanced scoring model to assess the creditworthiness of Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
 
The advanced scoring model will be fully developed by June 2002 and will leverage Standard & Poor's analytic strength and global credit experience, and RDB's comprehensive database of financial information and robust default data.
 
As a membership organization, RDB has, to date, operated by aggregating financial and company data on SMEs gathered from its 38 member institutions. Member banks in turn, gain access to RDB's database and scoring models, and use the information to internally rate the financial positions of unlisted companies. 
 
Standard & Poor's and RDB will work together to further develop the scoring model, as well as collaborate to improve the quality of recovery data and develop analytics for a recovery rate estimation model.

232,"After discussions with the management team, the HR group and our advisors on Wednesday, January 23, 2002, we agreed that Janet Dietrich and I would co-lead, with HR and our advisors, the completion of the proposed Key Employee Retention and Severance Program for Enron.

A lot of ground work has been completed, however, we need to bring it together into a complete, concise and workable plan that can be negotiated and agreed to over the next two weeks.  Timing is critical.   In order to work towards retaining the intellectual capital required to maximize the value of the assets of the estate, the internal plan needs to be substantially complete by the close of business, Monday, January 28, 2002.  From there, we will endeavor to complete final discussions with the Creditors Committee and their advisors during the weeks of January 28 and February 4, 2002.  

We need your assistance between now and this Monday to complete the preparation work.

Specifically, Janet or I will schedule some time with you today, tomorrow, over the weekend or on Monday to review to following information for Debtor companies:

validation of the information that you have already provided to HR
obtain any additional information necessary to make sure that the HR file is complete and accurate
your business plan, by quarter, for the next several quarters
a clear illustration of the value that exists (as it is currently best understood), along with a plan to realize that value
a clear mapping of your personnel to the plan
projected role, by individual - discussion to include your view on near term activities (ex: data mining) versus longer term roles (ex: asset sales, etc)
projected completion time, by individual, by task - to realize the value
discussion, by individual, regarding the most appropriate type(s) of retention / severance to utilize for their intended role
services provided, by individual, to debtor and non-debtor companies - including IT system connections and ties, partial and complete headcount, etc.

For non-debtor companies, we need to discuss:

services provided, by groups and individuals in debtor companies, including level of reliance, ability to separate tasks, individual / group services, etc.
any other issues that you believe need to be discussed and considered in these discussions


Preliminarily, we have broken out the groups as follows:

Janet Dietrich (with Kalen Pieper and Shanna Funkhouser) will meet with the following:

Wholesale		Jim Fallon	
EBS		Rich DiMichele
EGM		Gary Hickerson
EIM		Rodney Malcolm
EA		Don Miller		
Ongoing Concern	Janet Dietrich
Operations		Bob Hall
IT			Piper / Dayao

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.",Dynegy,,Enron NYSE
237,"
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.",Chewco http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/,$1.2 billion approximately $96 million approximately $113 million approximately $250 million approximately $132 million approximately $17 million approximately $5 million $17 million approximately $711 million $561 million $685 million $628 million,the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC the Special Committee the Enron Board of Directors Enron LJM Board Special Committee Joint Energy Development Investments JEDI LJM1 Chewco

Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed.
 
What This Change Means To You
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area.
 
To re-program an Auto-Dial button:
 
?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys

314,"The ISO (K Robb) circulated the ISO's position on the Def Penalties this
PM. It is attached.

As it stands, what the ISO wants now (or previously wanted) is an issue to
be decided by the BIC. What is now proposed - empowering the ISO to change
the deficiency rates if an adjacent ISO modifies (presumably upward) their
caps - has one large problem: if such an action were taken in the midst of
a Capability Period it would cause all sorts of issues with participant
positions.

Having said that I offer the following:

The FERC staff report strongly indicated that caps would have to exist (if
at all) on a regional basis and at similar levels.

In order to de-list and be free to sell out, a generator must make that
decision for the following month by the 10th of the current month. That is
trading a sure ICAP revenue stream for the increased opportunity to sell
energy at higher prices - even if some disaster befell one of out
neighbors, the amount that can move is limited by the transmission
capability.

What is the likelihood that any of the 3 NE ISOs will be uncapped next
Summer?

The transmission system limits how much energy can flow regardless of price
considerations. NY-NE about 1500Mw and NY-PJM about 2000 Mw (pending return
of the PARs).

BME, if faced with a reserve shortage (or inability to meet load), will
curtail exports to solve that problem.

While there is a wealth of information about the various
definition of ideal cut round brilliant diamonds, most consumers
have no idea what constitutes great cut for the fancy cut
diamonds such as pear, heart, oval, marquise, princess, emerald
or radiant.  There is no one industry standard for round let
alone fancy cuts, but there are some specific guidelines that we
use when we search for diamond.

Each fancy shape has its own set of depth percentage, table
percentage, crown height percentage and length to width ratio
that will increase the likelihood that the diamond will have
great brilliance, sparkle and beauty.

If you are shopping for a fancy cut diamond and are interested
what specifications define the top cut class for that shape,
give us a call and we will be happy to discuss this with you.

BULLETPROOF BEAUTY

Beauty meets the bulletproof vest in a gown designed for Miss
Israel to wear at the Miss Universe pageant next month.  The
top of the silk dress, embroidered with diamonds and pearls,
is covered by an army-issue flak jacket adorned with diamonds
for a so-called softer look, the Associated Press reported.

The dress sends a message that everyday life should go on
despite renewed violence, its designer said.  ``I want people
in Israel to continue to go out,'' said Galit Levi, a Tel Aviv
fashion designer. ``But be careful.''

Levi also designed two prior Miss Universe dresses. In 1998,
her design featured the faces of Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat
and Bill Clinton, leaders known for Middle East peace efforts.
In 1999, the first Arab Miss Israel, Rana Raslan, wore a dress
with a large red Star of David, an Israeli symbol.

Ilanit Levy, an 18-year-old soldier from Haifa, will wear the
bulletproof dress in the Miss Universe competition May 11 in

$500 MILLION HEIST FOILED IN LONDON

Would-be thieves crashed a bulldozer into London's Millennium
Dome on Nov. 7, hoping to snatch $500 million worth of
diamonds=01*including the spectacular 203-ct. De Beers Millennium
Star. The robbers planned to make their getaway in a speedboat
waiting on the Thames River. It would have been the world's
largest robbery, but the diamonds were already gone from
their tented exhibition arena, and Scotland Yard was waiting.
Officers disguised as cleaners overpowered the robbers, and a
dozen men were arrested without a shot fired.

Tipped off by police, dome officials had replaced the gems
with crystal fakes. De Beers officials say the pear-shaped
Millennium Star is arguably the most perfect large diamond in
the world.

Four men were arrested after trapping themselves in the vault
that usually houses the diamonds. Police picked up another
near a speedboat on the river, and a sixth man on the opposite
shore. Six others were apprehended later in southeastern
England.

Representatives of the New Millennium Experience Co., which
operates the dome, said the diamonds are displayed in an
exhibition area of the facility called the ""money zone"" and
are closely guarded. The Millennium Star is displayed in a
reinforced glass cylinder, and the area has alarms and
security cameras. The collection also features 11 large
diamonds of a distinctive vivid blue color.

Police said the robbers, apparently disguised as workmen,
crashed through a perimeter fence and drove the bulldozer
past security guards at around 9:30 a.m., shortly after the
attraction opened for the day. As they entered the building,
they donned gas masks before unleashing smoke bombs.
Fortunately, none of the estimated 100 visitors in the tent
were nearby.

Disguised police were positioned around the inside of the
dome. After the robbers went into the vaults and became
trapped, they were ordered to come out at gunpoint by the
officers. The intruders were captured as they bashed at the
display cases with hammers and sledgehammers.


PLATINUM PRICES HAVE SOARED
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

For the past ten years, platinum prices have fluctuated
between $350-$450 per troy ounce on the commodity markets.
In the second half of 1999 the prices start a climb that
saw prices move from $350 to almost $650 per ounce at the
start of this year.  This increase is mostly due to the
big increase in demand in platinum jewelry while supplies
have not been able to keep up.  Check out the price chart
at http://futures.tradingcharts.com/prairielinks/PL/M
that plots this trend.  Note how there are some weeks
where the price has $100 swings.

The impact on you the consumer is two fold, the prices you
pay today are almost twice what they were a year ago and
the supply of parts for mountings and jewelry can sometimes
take weeks to restock.  The other impact is that if you
bought jewelry with significant platinum content, it is
now worth more and would cost more to replace.  If your
appraisal is more than one year old, you might want to
consider having it reappraised for insurance purposes.


CLARITY GRADING
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Undoubtedly, size is an important factor in determining
the clarity grade.  The more difficult it is to see an
inclusion, particularly face-up, the less it will
influence the clarity grade.

Almost as a part of size, the number of inclusions must
be considered.  Clarity grading does not, however, consist
of merely counting inclusions, but rather judging how
readily that number can be seen.  A stone could, for
example, have a number of minute pinpoints and still be
graded high on the scale.  Usually one or two of the
largest inclusions will establish the grade.  Additional
inclusions, if small or minute, will have little or no
effect on the grade.

The position of an inclusion affects how readily it can be
seen.  Cutters call the area seen through the table the
""heart"" of the stone and make every effort to orient rough
stones so that inclusions are not visible through the
table of the finished stone.  The preferred position for
inclusions is under the bezel facets or near the girdle
because they are less noticeable there.

Sometimes inclusions are located where they cause
multiple reflections in the pavilion facets when you look
at the stone in the face-up position.  Such reflectors
lower the clarity grade more than similar non-reflecting
inclusions.

The type of inclusion can sometimes influence the clarity
grade.  Most inclusions do not threaten a diamond's
durability.  Remember, long before a stone ever reaches
the consumer, it has already been subjected to considerable
heat and stress in both the cutting and manufacturing
processes. It is unlikely to get rougher treatment simply
by being worn.  But large cleavages or feathers,
particularly when they reach the table or extend from the
crown through the girdle, are potentially hazardous since
they could be extended by a severe blow.

Most inclusions are white or colorless, but sometimes
they are black, brown, dark red, or green.  These, or
course, are easier to see and lower the clarity grade more
than a colorless inclusion.  However, curiously enough,
a dark inclusion dead center under the table is often
surprisingly inconspicuous.

Most inclusions have little impact on the beauty of the
diamond since they are not visible with the naked eye.
The high price associated with high clarity has more to
do with rarity than beauty.  If most diamonds were flawless,
it is likely that included diamonds would command the
greatest interest and price.


OCTAHEDRON
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D
The octahedron is the most common form of gem quality
diamond crystals.  The octahedron is shaped like two
pyramids, one upside down and fastened at the bases.
Perfectly formed octahedrons, called glassies, are among
the most striking of all mineral crystals.  Rough crystals
with this shape are well suited to be cut into the popular
round and princess shapes.


WHERE DIAMONDS FORM
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

Diamonds form only under certain chemical, temperature,
and pressure conditions.  Scientists estimate that the
necessary conditions of temperature and pressure can exist
in parts of the Earth's mantle (inside the crust) between
75 and 120 miles beneath the Earth's surface.

Almost all diamonds are carried to the surface by a specific
type of peridotite rock called kimberlite.  The Australian
diamonds were carried by a similar type of rock called
lamproite.  For billions of years, kimberlites have
periodically carried diamonds to the Earth's surface.

We call diamond deposits in kimberlite pipes primary
deposits.  The kimberlite itself is not very tough so it
breaks down with sunlight, heat and cold, wind and rain, and
other environmental forces.  The diamonds often get washed
out of the pipe and into the beds of rivers where they
gather in potholes and eddies. These are called alluvial
deposits.  If the river currents are strong enough, they
may carry their diamonds all the way to the sea.  There
the stones either settle to the bottom or are washed back
onto the beach.  These diamond rich areas are called
marine deposits.  Diamonds found in alluvial and marine
deposits and in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks are said
to be from secondary deposits.

on the SoCal system, for which Transwesten is 86% responsible, Ralph Komai, 
SoCal's PCB person provded some addtional information with respect to what is 
going on with the PCB activities on the SoCal system.  As a result of the 
PG&E press release, SoCal management directed additional sampling to be done 
at their interconnect with Transwestern and downstream of this interconnect.  
Ralph reported that a number of liquid samples came back at around 7 ppm, 
however one sample at their Kelso Station, near Barstow,  came back at 77 
ppm. 

Ralph had indicated that there has been an increase in the PCB's coming into 
their collection locations in the Needles area as evidenced by the following:

 Based upon 1997 data, almost no liquids greater than 50 ppm were revcovered

 Data collected in 1998 showed that approx. 8% of the liquids were greater 
than 50 ppm

 Data collected in 1999 showed that approx. 9% of the liquids were greater 
than 50 ppm

Based upon this, Ralph had stated that SoCal would be collecting additional 
sampling information and possibly entering into an internal montoring 
program, somewhat like PG&E is currently doing now.

I had informed Ralph that our Needles M/S facility had seen almost no liquids 
in the last 5 years, other than a recent accumulation of a one time pigging 
in early 2000 when a small volume of liquids (less than 55 gallons) had been 
collected.   We discussed that the accumulations seen on the SoCal system 
were probably from existing liquids on their system which had collected in 
low points in their pipeline and were moving downstream due to the increased 
flows from TW into SoCal.  

Ralph gave the impression that there were no immediate management tensions 
resulting from the recent ""hits"".  He just indicated that they would be 
watching their system and sampling at a more frequent basis.",Ralph Komai Ralph PCB,,"SoCal PCB PG&E revcovered

331,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron

New Mexico showed up at my office this  morning and made a surprise 
inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.  I felt the need to tag along 
with them.... 

Heres the way it is.  The EPA is required to address all federal concerns 
when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.  Even when it comes to 
an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed 
ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species 
Act (ESA).  This is not a new issue with the EPA.  Im having the same thing 
happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the 
status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.  The 
permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air 
group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.  I 
told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that 
the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken 
care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.  (As you remember, the Navajo Nation 
verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station 
sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the 
Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a 
call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys 
with the EPA.  Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as 
to whether surveys would be required or not.  I told him that we were 
expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would 
schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.  He advised me not to 
do this.  I think his decision had something to do with  the EPA usurping 
authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without 
Indian consent.  He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to 
whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo 
Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these 
types of issues. 

Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first 
became an issue, but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly  delay 
issuance of the permits.  Ill send something out via email when I hear from 
the EPA.

characterization plan that was submitted for sampling soil in the former 
surface impoundment area located at the northeast corner of the facility. A 
work plan for excavation and disposal of affected soil will be prepared 
subsequent to completion of the soil characterization plan. A tentative 
schedule is as follows:
? Meet with the Team and the contractor (Gandy) at the site on August 29th
? Collect soil samples for characterization on September 5th and 6th. Bill 
Olson with the OCD has indicated that he would like to be present for these 
activities.
? Receive lab results by September 21st
? Submit excavation work plan by October 5th

Whether or not we can complete the excavation work this year will be largely 
dependent upon obtaining a quick approval of an excavation work plan. The

are on Indain lands.  The agency provided a tentative date of 7 weeks before 
the the permits would be issued.  The EPA has required Transwestern to

the air permit.  Transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological 
assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 3 and 4.

A meeting was held with the Arizona DEQ to discuss what activities 
Transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the 
air permits for Station 1 and 2.  The agency gave a date of April 2002 as a 
normal issue date.  Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to 
be mid December of this year.  Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's 
management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased.  
On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction 
activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation 
construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant 
underground structures. This wil benefit the inbitiation of the Redrock

356,"Great, Jerry. I take it then that simultaneous operation of the new and old 
is a physical impossibility. Can we take this to the next step then, to 
carefully walk through the netting calculations (Shudeish & Prabhat are doing 
this) to minimize the total emissions that can occur (""potential to emit"") at 
any one time. The way I read the existing permits, however, is that allowable 
(and unenforceable bec of grandfathering?) emissions are NOx is 1428 tpy and 
CO is 429 tpy at each station, which may mean that we can not characterize 
these as ""minor"" sources. If the netting calculation is such that we can 
avoid New Source Review (I believe this to be the case bec there is planned 
to be a new reduction), we can do the 401.01(5) construction activities and 
try to get a fast-track permit approval.
I still do not whether, as a technical matter, the applications could qualify 
as ""minor"" revisions under R18-2-319.A, which mean,
1. Do not violate any applicable requirement
2. Do not involve substantive changes to existing monitoring, reporting, or 
record-keeping requirements in the permit
3. Do not require or change a case-by-case determination of an emission 
limitation or other standard, or a source-specific determination of ambient 
impacts, or a visibility or increment analysis
4. Do not seek to establish or change a permit condition for which there is 
no corresponding underlying applicable requirement and that the source has 
assumed in order to avoid an applicable requirement to which the source would 
otherwise be subject. The terms and conditions include:
     a. A federally enforceable emissions cap that the source would assume to 
avoid classification as a modification under any provision of Title I of the 
Clean Air Act; and
     b. An alternative emisssions limit approved under regulations 
promulgated under CAA sec 112(i)(5)
5. Are not modifications under and provision of Title I of the CAA
6. Are not changes in fuels not represented in the permit application or 
provided for in the permit
7. The increase in the source's potential to emit is not significant (40 tpy 
NOx, etc) [not applicable to TWP bec net reduction]
8. Are not required to processed as a significant revision under R18-2-320 
(refers to signif change in existing monitoring terms or relaxation of 
reporting/recordkeeping or ""does not qualify as a minor permit revision...."")
If someone could make a hard analysis of the foregoing, that might provide us 
additional strength.

Thank you for sending me a copy of the MOU between you and NWTF.  The RMEF,
while interested in working with you, will need more substance behind the
partnership and how we intended to work together.  I'm up to my neck in a
restructuring process through the end of the month or I would offer some
recommendations.

If you would like to take a crack at a draft MOU with specific details
associated with the partnership, I would be happy to review another draft.
In November, I should have a bit more time to spend on this opportunity.  If
you are simply looking for a local partnership to work on projects, I will
steer you to Alan or one of our local staff members in the region.

Again, thank you for the interest and I look forward to working with you on
a mutually beneficial partnership.

Summarizing the issue as I can understand them.

1. Your problem.  Cat will have to change the units at Station 2 to 3512 to 
make the driver HP for 370 kw.  As I indicated we need to also make 
adjustment so that the emissions do not exceed that of the 3508 as presented 
originally on March 21.

2. My problem.  The EPA will only allow the generators to emit a cumulative 
tonnage that works out to be 7826 running hours a year.  To get the 8736 
hours that I need the generation (at both stations) I will need to reduce 
total emissions by about 11 percent.  Obviously, in the fully loaded 
condition were at, lower horsepower is not an option.

Need some way to work these two items out to a mutually agreeable solution.  
Don't know the effect on your systems (ie: the cat engines) if a catalytic 
system is installed or if this is better then revision to the clean burn 
units (which if I recall just makes the hp worse).  

I'd also like to keep the units at 2 and 3 similar, for spare issues and 
other items, but would need to have a good idea what this is costing before I 
can approve.  

The other issue is that I need to resolve this within two days.  I be in 
Phoenix tomorrow but will leave my cell phone on.  713-850-1725.  Otherwise, 
leave a message on phone mail.  Email will not be all that great.

Here is my review of the Kingman Class I permit.  Please review my review of
the transition period operating hour limitations.  If my logic is correct I
can't see why ADEQ would limit us to 2000 hours per engine.  Using their
numbers it appears to me that allowing us to operate 4,380 hours (as
originally requested) would not cause an exceedance in the PSD levels.

Let me know if you have any additional comments.  I'm reviewing the
Flagstaff permit now.

362,"Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits 
which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.  The most 
critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really 
restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines.  
We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.  Let me 
know what additional information you may need. 


1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest
Operations.

2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based
on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.  At 60F
and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all
operating conditions.  However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as 
high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.

The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of
the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20%
of the time.  TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of
reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.  The potential
to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of
lb/hr and ton/yr.  These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA
for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA
Statement of Basis document). Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd
values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that
under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the
emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is
requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows
emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that
the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.

3. The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires
Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not
normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas.
Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel
monitoring schedules to use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or
gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the
natural gas.",Roger Klagetoh Luepp Danny Pribble Transwestern,,"Transwetern NOx and CO VP Southwest

activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.

Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and 
has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the 
permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e 
mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete, 
but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to 
the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15 
and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ 
plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in 
Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is located approx. 
30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council 
Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no 
responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process, 
they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring 
sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel 
monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them 
otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer 
for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also 
an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions 
from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.

Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for 
the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also 
approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There 
are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment 
period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it 
will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on 
the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this 
date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for 
station 3 and or 4.

EPA issue the station 4 permit.  If we do not initiate any construction 
pertaining to the turbine or auxillary generators, then the new permit doesnt 
apply and we can still operate under the existing permit which was issued 
about 2 years ago.  In Enron, 6 months is an eternity and who knows what will 
happern then?  By having the permit, but not constructing, we will be  OK.  
If we decide to do the turbine project  within the period of time that the 
permit is valid, then were ahead of the game.  If not, and a more firm 
decision is made to not do anything in the future, Ill contact EPA and 
request termination of the permit.  Usually, the agency places a caveot that 
if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit 
automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions

394,"For those who have never traveled to the great West, cattle guards are
horizontal steel rails placed on the road at fence openings to prevent
  cattle from crossing.  For some reason the bovines will not step on the
guards, probably because they fear getting their feet caught between the
rails. I need to make that clear in order for you to appreciate the
following true story:

President Clinton received a report that there were over 100,000 cattle
  guards in Colorado.  Because Colorado ranchers protested his proposed
  changes in grazing policies, he ordered Secretary of Interior Bruce
  Babbitt to fire half of the guards immediately. Before Babbitt could
respond, and presumably straighten him out, Colorado's congresswoman
Pat Schroeder intervened with a request that before any were fired, they
be given six months of retraining.

  Al Gore, never one to pass up a chance to piggy back on any story,
pointed out that if the Guards had formed a strong union, such as the
teachers have with the NEA, they would not be in jeopardy.

  ....And so it goes, in this election year.  Don't you just love the
smell of political napalm in the morning?  We are governed by a pack of
fools!






What is a Goron?


1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
    environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his
own
farm: a
    polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income
last
year.

2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is anti-smoking and
anti-tobacco
    when he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted
government
    subsidies.

3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in
fact
he
    was placed by family influence in a ""cushy"" correspondent's job
and
the
    only action he saw was that of his Brownie camera!(and his bong)

4. Gorons actually believe that Al Gore is justified in illegally
raising
    political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt
    Law educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al Gore to accept large
sums
    of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had
taken
vows of
    poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to ""invent the
internet""
    would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks of
    potentially incriminating e-mail!

7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the
    models for the book and movie, ""Love Story"" even though the
book's
author,
    Erich Segal, says that's a bunch of crap.

8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion
    against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars
in
    Occidental Petroleum stock.

9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's
    immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent
on
the
    subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton ""one of the
greatest
    Presidents of our history.""

  10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't
    bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
    ineffective that it has led to election of Republicans as BOTH
of
    Tennessee's senators.

  11. Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be
    the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he
served
to the
    poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum
    house that he was renting to them.


  Cautionary Note:Medical researchers acknowledge the Gorons are
generally
   harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately,
   overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to actually
vote
for
   Gore! They should be carefully protected from their ailment,
since
it
may
   be harmful to their well-being, yours, mine, and that of the USA.
   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out
to
aid
   the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and PLEASE pass this on to
your
   normal friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.",Clinton Babbitt Pat Schroeder Al Gore Guards Gore Erich Segal Lieberman,"500,000 a million

Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project 
proposed for the Transwestern mainline system.  David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi 
and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon 
his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the 
model will yeild some useful information.  Adewumi was asked about the 
simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can 
address this situation.  He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline 
segement  selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information 
could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and 
elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected.  As is the 
case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be 
addressed until we begin the process. 

It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact 
Michael Adewumi.  David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and 
operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input.  It may also be in 
the best interest of this project  to see a team of technical and operational 
experts from Enron and Transwestern begin a  brain stroming of this project 
during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning 
trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping.  By working through 
the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns  and 
increase the cleaning success.  Although Transwestern has been involved in 
this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data 
results, the system has met with variable success.  The more technical and 
operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be 
the modeling conclusions and results of the  cleaning activity. ","Michael Adewumi David Roensch Adewumi

EMERALD: MAY BIRTHSTONE
==============================
Emerald is a green variety of the mineral beryl.  One of the
rarest members of the beryl family-only the red variety
(sometimes called ""red emerald"") is rarer-it is one of the most
highly prized of all the gems.  Aside from being the birthstone
for May, it was historically believed to bestow on its wearer
faithfulness and unchanging love, and was thought to enable
the wearer to forecast events.

The highest-quality emerald has the color of fresh young green
grass-an almost pure spectral green, possibly with a very faint
tint of blue, as in the finest emerald from Columbia, which is
considered by connoisseurs to be the world's finest.  Other
sources include Brazil, Zambia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia
and India.  Flawless emeralds are rare, so their ""flaws"" have
come to serve almost as ""fingerprints,"" while flawless
emeralds are immediately suspect.  Although a hard stone,
emerald will chip easily since it tends to be somewhat brittle,
so special care should be given in wearing and handling.

Techniques to enhance color and reduce the visibility of flaws
are also frequently used.  A common practice is to fill
surface-reaching cracks with oil (sometimes tinted green), a
practice that goes back to early Greek times.  Today's
emeralds are oiled using a vacuum/heat technology.  This is a
widely accepted trade practice, since it is actually good for
the stone in light of its fragile nature.  Oiling hides some
of the whitish flaws, which are actually cracks, filling the
cracks so they become less visible.  The oil becomes an
integral part of the emerald unless it is subjected to some
type of degreasing procedure.  The development and use of
the ultrasonic cleaner has brought to light the extensive-
ness of this practice.  Never clean emeralds in an
ultrasonic cleaner.

While oiling is considered an acceptable practice, be sure
the price reflects the actual quality of the stone.  If
necessary, most emeralds can be ""re-oiled.""


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
=========================

Name:   Uncle Sam
Weight: 40.23 carats (rough) and 12.42 carats (cut)
Color:  M (very light brown)
Clarity:VVS1
Shape: Emerald Cut

The Uncle Sam diamond, which was discovered in the ""Crater
of diamonds"" in Arkansas in 1924, is the largest yet found
in the United States.  Peiken Jewelers of New York City,
owned the Uncle Sam for many years.  For a while, it was
on loan to the American Museum of Natural History.  In
1971, Sidney de Young, a dealer from Boston, bought the
diamond and then sold it to an unnamed collector.


SEA DIAMONDS
===========================================
An enterprising Texan called Sammy Collins drew worldwide
attention in 1962 when he announced that he'd recovered
50,000 carats of diamonds worth $1.5 million from the
seabed off the treacherous Diamond Coast of South West
Africa.  Collins figured that since diamonds had been
found in abundant amounts along the coast, most likely
carried there by the Vaal and Orange rivers from some
far inland deposit, they also ought to be found under
the ocean.

Over a period of three years, Collins used the equivalent
of huge vacuum sweepers to suck some 400,000 carats of
diamonds from the seabed.  His adventures set off a
mini-rush by others to try this new type of exploration
but terrible working conditions and uncertain diamond
deposits sent most into early obscurity.

Today, with improved technology, De Beers and others are
once again probing the waters of the South Atlantic,
bringing closer the prospect of viable undersea
diamond recovery.


LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL?
============================================
We will be attending the annual JCK Jewelry Show in Las Vegas
the first week of June.  This is your opportunity to get access
to wonderful designer jewelry at a fraction of regular retail
prices.  With almost 3,000 booths of diamonds and jewelry from
all over the world, this trade show brings the most beautiful
jewelry in the world to one place.

If you have special piece of jewelry you've always wanted but
didn't think you could afford, give us a call so we can find
it for you.  The same goes for color gem stones since we can
hand pick from the most beautiful colored stones in the world
for your special ring, pendant or bracelet.

While the Diamond Source of Virginia does not have an inventory
of diamonds or jewelry, we have accounts with the leading
wholesalers and designers across the country and can special
order your custom jewelry or pick it out in person at this show.
We go with our shopping list for our customers and return with
the best of the best.  If you have a special request, please
give Anne a call at 888-477-8385 and tell us what you want.


SI2 CLARITY
=========================
While we recommend at least SI1 clarity for most
diamonds to ensure they are ""eye clean,"" many consumers
think that SI2 means nothing visible with the naked eye.
The following comments define the official GIA position:

""SI stones contain noticeable inclusions which are easy
(SI1) or very easy (SI2) for a trained grader to see
under 10X. Typical inclusions are included crystals,
clouds, and feathers, normally centrally located and
noticed immediately. A stone with an eye visible
inclusion can still be graded SI. You must consider the
size, nature, position, number, and color or relief of
the inclusion. The size and shape of the stone are
important too. Characteristics in the SI1 grade usually
are not visible to the unaided eye face-up.
Characteristics in some SI2 stones can be seen with the
unaided eye.""

We find that over half of the SI2 stones have visible
inclusions to the naked eye. Note the above comments
say ""visible to the unaided eye face-up."" With most
shapes of diamonds, inclusions are often easily visible
from the side where there are few, if any, facets to
hide them. We just sent a VS1 clarity princess back to
the wholesaler because the inclusion, while not visible
face-up, was easily visible with the naked eye from the
side. You can imagine what the SI2 diamonds look like
from the side if they are visible face-up. If the
mounting hides the side of the diamond, these side
visible inclusions are not a problem. But most mountings
show off the side of a diamond and make them easy to see.

INSURANCE QUESTIONS
==============================
Most people do not realize that insurers differ widely in
what they offer regarding coverage and reimbursement or
replacement.  Many insurance companies will not reimburse
the ""full value"" provided in the policy but, rather,
exercise a ""replacement"" option--and will offer a sum in
cash less than the amount for which the jewelry is
insured, or offer to replace it for you.  Therefore it is
important to ask some very specific questions to determine
the precise coverage offered.  We recommend asking the
insurer at least the following:

1) How do you satisfy claims?  Do you reimburse the insured
amount in cash?  If not, how is the amount of the cash
settlement determined?  Or do you replace the jewelry?

2) What involvements do I have in the replacement of an
item?  What assurance do I have that the replacement will be
of comparable quality and value?

3) What is your coverage on articles that cannot be
replaced?

4) Exactly what risks does my policy cover--all risks?
Mysterious disappearance?  Am I covered in all geographic
areas?  At all times?

5) Are their any exemptions or exclusions?  What if the loss
involves negligence?  What happens if the diamond falls out?

6) What are the deductibles, if any?

7) What documentation do you expect me to provide?

Every week we hear yet another story of a customer who paid
insurance premiums for years and were shocked to discover
how little protection they really had when they did have a
claim.  Check the small print before you need it.


FOUR C'S
===========================
Diamond quality and value are determined by four factors.
These factors are called the ""Four C's.""  If we were to rank
them based on their importance in determining the value of a
diamond, we would list them as follows:

1) Color
2) Clarity
3) Cut and proportion
4) Carat weight

In terms of determining beauty, however, we would rank them
in a different order:

1) Cut and proportion
2) Color
3) Clarity
4) Carat weight

When diamond shopping, it pays to put your focus on cut and
proportion since this is where you get the most impact on
beauty while paying little premium in price.  We recommend
investing your dollars in beauty you see rather than rarity
and higher ""quality"" not visible to your eye.

BOW TIE
=======
One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning
in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie, or butterfly effect,
a darkened area across the center or widest part of the
stone, depending upon the cut.  The bow tie is commonly
seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any
fancy shape.  Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will
exhibit some minimal bow tie effect.  Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper
proportioning.  In poorly proportioned stones there is a
pronounced bow tie; the more pronounced, the poorer the
proportioning.  The less pronounced the bow tie, the better
the proportioning.  The degree to which the bow tie is
evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make (cut).


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:

415,"I had dinner tonight with a Robert Jacobs EOTT  V.P. West Coast and Ed 
Attanasio EOTT Senior Counsel.  This dinner meeting was put together by Gary 
Fuller.  Both Jacobs and Attansio expressed serious concern about ETS's 
abilty to provide environmental expertise and representation at the EOTT 
Bakersfield facilities due to Gary's departure.  They were concerned because 
of the numerous visits by state regulatory personnel conducting unnounced 
onsite inspections and the fact that EOTT may not have an onsite 
environmental representative.  They were highly complementary of Gary and 
were aware of the good repoire he had established with the agencies and they 
felt they would be losing this repoire and credibility if his position was 
not filled with a person located in Bakersfield.  As a courtesy to our 
customer, I told them I would pass on this information to the powers to be in 
Houston.  

After a review of the environmental records and the compliance load for what 
Gary has responsible for,  Im wondering if we should  fill the Bakersfield 
position, or move that position to Midland and possibly use Gary as a 
""temporary technical contact"" for ETS.  As you may or may not know, Gary is 
accepting a position with a bakersfield consulting company which specializes 
in providing operation services for energy companys.  Gary will be in charge 
of the environmental  and safety responsibilities for those companies which 
choose to use their service. 

 I understand that there is some environmental sensitivity in California that 
does, at times go above what is required in other states.  However, getting 
the employees at the Bakersfield location on board with skill base pay will 
alleviate much of the existing workload.  What the employees can't handle or 
issues that are above the skill base pay level requirements, can be handled 
and addressed  by Butch and myself with Gary's occasional assistance.  Having 
Gary as a technical contact living in Bakersfield will satisify EOTT's 
concern of having an environmental expert  available for those times when 
agencies arrive unnounced and  at the same time give EOTT the comfort and 
security that they want by knowing that they will be represented by a person 
of Gary's reputation and character. 

In line with this, there appears to be a larger workload and work area in 
MIdland rather than in Bakersfield.  Remediation activites, permitting and 
compliance will be a full time position with the EOTT, Transwestern and 
Northern faciltiies which comprise the Midland area.  In this area, there are 
approximately 13 field teams to provide technical assistance and training 
for.  I feel this will be a full time job.  I think we should give 
consideration to possible using Gary's expertise on a part time basis in 
Bakersfield and relocate and fill his position in Mildand, Tx.    ","a Robert Jacobs EOTT   Ed Gary

416," Good seeing you again.  As I mentioned yesterday, I am sending you a copy of 
the Conservation Easement that has been granted to Cal Dept of Fish and Game 
over the NCL property.  I would appreciate if you could get a copy to John 
Schaefer (I couldn't find him in the Enron directory).

 As you will see, the Conservation Easement references the State Endangered 
Species Take Permit I gave you previously, so the two should be read in 
conjuction.  Also, I wanted to let you and whoever in environmental ends up 
servicing the assets out here two other things:  first, Kenny Maltby of ETS 
Bakersfield is our designated ""representative responsible for communications 
with the Department and for overseeing compliance with th[e Take permit]"", as 
specified in section 5.1 of the permit.  (Kenny and I are really the only 
personnel in California who are aware of the Permit and its requirements.)  

 Second, various sections of the permit require use of "" a knowledgeable, 
experienced biologist.""   (See e.g., Section 5.4.)  We have been using a 
biologist in Bakersfield, Randi McCormick, for this purpose for years.  I 
strongly urge we continue to use her because she knows our operations, knows 
our people, knows our contractors, knows our habitat, knows our permit 
conditions, has good relations/credibility  with Cal. Fish and Game and US 
Fish and Wildlife, and has always been reasonable with and responsive to us.  
I would like to get her on a contract wth ETS.

 Lastly, I am getting more eager to see and discuss the results of the audit 
now after your statements regarding the credibility of the sampling in the 
1997 ""baseline"" study done by WZI.  (It's a very interesting issue for many 
reasons, which I'll spare going into here; obviously, the crux of my concern 
is that it may not be much of a baseline at all.)  So, I would like to have 
some input into the question of how ""resampling"" would be done, if possible, 
because of the Koch indemnification issues presented.  So please be sure that 
your enviro folks remember our EOTT company motto: ""Call Before you Dig!""

 Again, good seeing you and the crew, and I look forward to talking about 
these and other issues again real soon.  In particular, if there's any other 
info i can get your enviro folks that they'd find helpful, please let me 
know. --ETA","John

 Sorry for the delayed response. I have just got back from an
overseas trip yesterday. I am in the process of preparing a progress report
for you. We have obtained some additional interesting results. I was also
waiting for input from your group. You may recall that at the end of our
Houston meeting, John told me that he would be getting back to me on some
specific directions from the group. I believe that we would be done with the
major aspects of PCB work soon, then we would be focusing on arsenic. Please
let me know of any thoughts and ideas. Thanks Larry.

Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 
C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this 
issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further 
actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was 
received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of 
interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing 
smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide 
vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to 
simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received 
permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, 
Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher 
turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not 
make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by 
Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is 
authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern 
from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this 
turbine at their descretion.

In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a 
emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than 
the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 
were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be 
mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple 
cycle.   

  Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to 
be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the 
Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern 
has 30 days to request another hearing.

431,"This is just a short update on the conference call just completed with 
Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project 
proposed for the Transwestern mainline system.  David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi 
and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon 
his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the 
model will yeild some useful information.  Adewumi was asked about the 
simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can 
address this situation.  He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline 
segement  selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information 
could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and 
elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected.  As is the 
case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be 
addressed until we begin the process. 

It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact 
Michael Adewumi.  David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and 
operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input.  It may also be in 
the best interest of this project  to see a team of technical and operational 
experts from Enron and Transwestern begin a  brain stroming of this project 
during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning 
trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping.  By working through 
the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns  and 
increase the cleaning success.  Although Transwestern has been involved in 
this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data 
results, the system has met with variable success.  The more technical and 
operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be 
the modeling conclusions and results of the  cleaning activity. ","Michael Adewumi David Roensch Adewumi

434,"For those who have never traveled to the great West, cattle guards are
horizontal steel rails placed on the road at fence openings to prevent
  cattle from crossing.  For some reason the bovines will not step on the
guards, probably because they fear getting their feet caught between the
rails. I need to make that clear in order for you to appreciate the
following true story:

President Clinton received a report that there were over 100,000 cattle
  guards in Colorado.  Because Colorado ranchers protested his proposed
  changes in grazing policies, he ordered Secretary of Interior Bruce
  Babbitt to fire half of the guards immediately. Before Babbitt could
respond, and presumably straighten him out, Colorado's congresswoman
Pat Schroeder intervened with a request that before any were fired, they
be given six months of retraining.

  Al Gore, never one to pass up a chance to piggy back on any story,
pointed out that if the Guards had formed a strong union, such as the
teachers have with the NEA, they would not be in jeopardy.

  ....And so it goes, in this election year.  Don't you just love the
smell of political napalm in the morning?  We are governed by a pack of
fools!






What is a Goron?


1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
    environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his
own
farm: a
    polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income
last
year.

2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is anti-smoking and
anti-tobacco
    when he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted
government
    subsidies.

3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in
fact
he
    was placed by family influence in a ""cushy"" correspondent's job
and
the
    only action he saw was that of his Brownie camera!(and his bong)

4. Gorons actually believe that Al Gore is justified in illegally
raising
    political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt
    Law educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al Gore to accept large
sums
    of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had
taken
vows of
    poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to ""invent the
internet""
    would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks of
    potentially incriminating e-mail!

7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the
    models for the book and movie, ""Love Story"" even though the
book's
author,
    Erich Segal, says that's a bunch of crap.

8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion
    against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars
in
    Occidental Petroleum stock.

9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's
    immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent
on
the
    subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton ""one of the
greatest
    Presidents of our history.""

  10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't
    bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
    ineffective that it has led to election of Republicans as BOTH

in  general and, in particular, with regard to conservation programs. There=

are  several ways in which I think the NYISO is inextricably involved with=

energy  efficiency:=20

The current competitive market the NYISO is overseeing is quite simply not =

working when it comes to demand or load responding to prices. Supply or =20
generators are responding to price=01*imperfectly, but there is significant=
 =20
response. So we have ""half a market."" We should be seeking to put demand on=
=20

in=20
the  direction of facilitating that, but with basically all consumers on fl=
at=20
or  average rates, and with almost all LSEs (the regulated distribution=20
companies)  able to pass along their energy costs, there is little basis fo=
r=20
responding to  high prices even when we have the software mechanisms in pla=
ce=20
to do so.  Someone needs to find a way to have consumers confronting real=

prices=01*or at  least paying a risk premium for not having to do so. Someo=

needs to find a  way to have LSEs have a financial incentive to keep prices=

their=20
(fixed price)  customers, through incentives, to reduce their use when pric=

are high.  Environmentally, there is a lot at stake in getting the market t=
o=20
work right,  and the ISO plays a major role in that, even when it is not it=
s=20
immediate  responsibility.=20
The emergency measures the ISO is considering have very significant =20
environmental impacts. Small diesel generators may be needed to avoid the =
=20
significant social costs of outages. One environmental concern here is that=
 =20
such generators be restricted to emergency conditions, and not become a new=

Effective Sunday, December 3, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a Demand Mismatch Order for ALL Primary Pools.
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for

493,"Bret: I discussed this with Bill Kendrick this afternoon, our suggestion is 
that you forward my original message on the subject to Texaco's attorney 
asking several questions: 1) is Texaco aware of the pipeline removal 
activities; 2) has the release been stopped and how; 3) has the extent of 
impacted soil been determined and does it extend onto NNG's property or down 
to groundwater; and 4) has the NMOCD been notified. We should also indicate 
our concern that other Texaco pipelines crossing near or through NNG's 
facility may also be in poor condition and should be checked, particularly 
the two lines which cross the southwestern corner of the NNG facility near 
the location of monitor well MW-3 (NNG's well which contains PSH). This will 
allow Texaco the opportunity to notify the OCD. 

In a related matter, I think a copy of the letter that I prepared for Larry 
regarding excavation activities should be transmitted to Texaco's attorney 
and the OCD. I suggest sending a copy of this letter to the OCD because Bill 
Olson with the OCD had asked for a copy of any correspondence that was 
generated regarding the excavation activities and because Texaco has already 
indicated that their lab results did not identify the presence of impacted 
soil remaining in the excavation area.

494,"George, Ive read through your stuff on the Gomez remediation and need some 
help.  Why are we collecting so much groundwater.  Im concerned that charges 
for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive, even though the 
costs are reasonable.  Are we trying to dewater or what?  Other than that, I 
dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should 
get busy on the well installations.  Do you think this will do it with 
respect to no more wells needed.  Id like to get to that position as quickly 
as possible. ",George,,Gomez
495,"Larry-

Water Disposal:  The current rate of water production has been established as 
a compromise between what we think is most effective for removing PSH and 
what we think are reasonable disposal costs. Our objective is to flush out 
PSH that is trapped in dissolution channels and fractures in the aquifer. 
Dewatering is not an objective because the shallow aquifer is too prolific a 
producer. In an effort to flush out trapped PSH we pump 200 bbls of 
groundwater twice weekly (or 1600 bbl per month). In addition we manually 
remove any accumulated PSH from recovery wells that do not have pumps in 
them. Pumping 200 bbls per cycle takes about 24 hours and is adequate to 
create a significant drawdown of the aquifer in the immediate vicinity of the 
former pit area. The aquifer will recharge within 24 hours, but we don't 
start another cycle until after about 60 hours in order to limit the number 
of cycles to two per week. The number of cycles is limited to two per week 
primarily for cost considerations, but also because our minor permit 
specifies a maximum disposal rate of 400 bbl per week. If we were to limit 
the number of cycles to one per week we would drop our PSH removal efficiency 
by nearly 50%; likewise, if we were to increase the number of cycles to four 
per week we would increase our removal efficiency by nearly 100%. Note that 
beyond about four cycles per week, there will be a deminishing advantage to 
increasing the number of cycles due to the time it takes to draw down the 
aquifer and the time it takes for the aquifer to recharge. Cycling the pumps 
twice per week also fits well into our O&M schedule for other sites in the 
area. We are spending about $3,200 per month for O&M at this site, about 
$1,800 per month on water disposal and $1,400 for O&M labor. These costs are 
directly proportional to the number of cycles per week that we operate the 
pumps. In regard to the effectiveness of this scheme, we have seen some 
positive indications in both a reduction of accumulated PSH in the former pit 
area recovery wells and a decrease in dissolved phase contaminants at monitor 
wells downgradient from the former pit area. An exception to this is the 
accumulation of PSH from what appears to be another source located west of 
the former pit area. This issue is being addressed by the installation of 
additional recovery wells. Another note regarding water disposal, we had 
briefly discussed the possibility of irrigating produced water rather than 
hauling it. We temporarily dismissed this idea over concern that arsenic 
contained in groundwater might accumulate in surface soil as a result of 
irrigation. We should revisit this idea next spring if it appears that 
pumping will continue much longer.

Monitor Wells:  Although the additional wells that we have planned should 
adequately delineate the dissolved phase plume, I am reluctant to think that 
these will be the last. The TRC recently rejected closure requests for about 
a half-dozen ENA sites. In a recent meeting between the TRC and David Ayers 
(for ENA), the TRC requested that ENA return to the sites and delineate 
dissolved phase contaminant plumes to MCL concentrations. Although the TRC 
has not yet made that request for this site, it is certainly a possibility. 
This is also consistent with recent draft guidance documents prepared by the 
TRC that specifies plume delineation to MCL concentrations. Currently, 
arsenic is the only contaminant in groundwater that is not delineated to MCL 
concentrations, more specifically, downgradient and east of the release area. 
We will have to wait and see what results we get from the new wells before we 
have a better idea whether any additional wells may someday be required. 

Recovery Wells:  This is totally dependent on what we find with the 
additional recovery wells. I suspect that we are going to confirm a separate 
source of PSH and will require additional wells to adequately remove PSH.

Attorney - Client Communication

I just spoke with Mr. Charles de Saillan, Asst. General Counsel for the NMED, 
concerning the referenced Compliance Order.  Apparently the NMED mailed out 
60 of these orders last week.  The NM legislature has adopted a statute of 
limitations under the NM Air Quality Act and the NMED was acting to attempt 
to foreclose the use of this defense.  (Dave - can Mary hunt this new 
legislation down??).

The language in the order assessing a $15,000 penalty per day of violation is 
standard language when the NMED has not assessed a specific figure.  It will 
be a couple of weeks before the NMED will be able to provide us a specific 
penalty.  We discussed settlement and the administrative hearing process.  A 
settlement meeting is not likely to take place soon due to the NMED's 
workload.  We need to have a number from the NMED before the settlement 
conference anyway. We will have to file the request to go to hearing no later 
tahn July 18th.  However, Charlie stated that if the respondent evidenced 
good faith to achieve as settlement the Secretary had the discretion to allow 
additional time to submit a full answer (where we provided all of the details 
of our defense.)

I told Charlie we would be organizing ourselves internally and that we would 
get back to him with some proposed dates for a settlement conference, a 
request for hearing and a request to extend the time in which to file an 
answer - preferably tied to after the settlement conference.

Let's see about dates and Dave or I will call the NMED and submit a letter 
with the three items above.  We want to make sure that the NMED has time 
before the end of the 30 day period to respond to our request for an 
extension on the answer.

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.

When looking at representation and determining if there is advserse impact =

You want to determine if women (or minorities, or over 40), based on their =
representation, are being adversely effected.  You look at the total women =
and how their distribution over the ratings equates, then you look at the t=
otal men and how their distribution equates--you are looking at them indivi=
dually and not overall.  After this is calculated you determine by rating c=
ategory if women are within 80% of the ratings men received-- if they are w=
ithin 80% there is no adverse impact.  If it is less than 80% there is adve=
rse impact.  For example, let's look at the ""2"" category.  There are 16 of =
26 men that received ""2's"" or 61.5% of the male representation.  There are =
3 of 6 females that received ""2's""  or 50% of the female representation.  T=
o determine if the females are being adversely effected you take 50% and di=
vide it by 61.5% and get 81.3%--as this is more than 80% there is no advers=
e impact.  Now, let me throw a curve ball.  In calculating adverse impact i=
t is assumed that if women (or minorites) are being effected more it is a b=
ad thing.  In the case of looking at ratings this may not be the case so a =
standard formula cannot be applied.  For example,  if more women are gettin=
g ""1's"" than the males this is not a bad thing but if more women are gettin=
g ""5""s this is a bad thing!  You have to use some judgement on this because=
 if more female's based on their representation are getting 3's maybe that =
is bad and maybe that is good--you have to look at the overall picture.  Wh=
en you are calculating adverse impact on employment actions like hires or t=

I would recommend that you proceed with the chart as I typed it above and n=

565,"Talked to Dave.  In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he 
sees it.  It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key 
points:
Based on an expectation that the ""expedited siting"" bill would help site 
plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board.

The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm 
requirement.
The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or 
2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting 
down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two 
LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting).
In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO 
(which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of 
going to the market, thus killing the economics.
On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that ""...it 
be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has 
contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and 
maintain the plant,"" 
it forces Dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is 
(i.e, before the project has been approved), and,
it effectively prevents Enron from having the option to use internal 
resources (this issue is very specific to Enron; I can explain more if folks 
prefer).

In short, bullets 1-3 would seem to affect both Enron and the market, while 
the last bullet is, according to Dave, very Enron specific.  Point 2 in 
bullet 4, according to Dave is sensitive and should not be made public.

If any questions, let me know.  Bruno has emailed the price cap and the 
""general-funds-to-help-finance-the-cap"" bills, and faxed the siting bill.

HEADLINE: ?Californians Fear High Electric Bills

BYLINE: SETH HETTENA


DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

BODY:

???Ray Marquez wonders whether he'll have to cut back on food or gas in order
to pay his electricity bill.

??The 34-year-old Orange County maintenance man usually pays $80 a month for
power during summer months. Now, he's trying to figure out how to pay an
electricity bill that could push $130 come June 1.

??''Since I got married and had children, you know, I've been dealing with
balancing bills,'' he said Wednesday. ''But if I now have to pay more for
electricity, I'm not going to have money for gas or food for the kids.''

??As Californians coped with rolling blackouts that darkened thousands of
businesses and homes Monday and Tuesday, many struggled with an even bigger
worry: how to pay for soaring energy costs.

??In March, the state Public Utilities Commission approved the biggest rate
increase in California history, up to 46 percent for customers of Southern
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Those rate hikes start hitting
customers in next month's bill.

??Gailen Kyle, who raises alfalfa on 1,600 acres in the Mojave Desert, says a
40 percent increase would put his farm out of business.

??''It would end us,'' the third-generation farmer said. ''Everybody here that
farms alfalfa would be out of business.''

??Kyle, 46, said he has to pump water nearly around the clock from wells
drilled 310 feet below his farm near Lancaster. A small increase in the price 
of
energy a few months ago added $80,000 to the $400,000 annual bill he was 
already
paying.

??To save money, Kyle agreed to become an ''interruptible'' customer, meaning
he voluntarily allows his power to be shut off during statewide electricity
shortages in exchange for reduced rates. So far this year, his power has been
cut 26 times.

??Even before the state utilities commission raised rates, residents were
paying 26 percent more for electricity than the nationwide average, according 
to
federal statistics. Only customers in New England, New York, Alaska and Hawaii
pay more.

??One of the problems is that the wholesale cost of electricity has risen
sharply over the past year but under California's 1996 deregulation law the
state's largest utilities, PG&E and SoCal Edison, have been prevented from
passing their costs to customers. In April, PG&E declared bankruptcy.

??The West isn't just facing spiraling costs and a shortage of supplies,
however. Its transmission system is fragmented and overworked and would take
years to improve, power officials told the region's governors Wednesday.

??''There is no immediate solution,'' said Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, one of
four governors participating in a six-hour, round-table meeting with industry
representatives.

??The Western Governors Association was told there is no established method 
for
paying for transmission upgrades, and market and regulatory barriers stand in
the way. It's not even clear where new power lines are most needed.

??The group, which included the governors of Utah, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming,
has given energy experts until July 15 to recommend ways to eliminate
bottlenecks.

??Meanwhile Californians, who've already weathered six days of rolling
blackouts this year, fear they'll soon be paying more for less service.

??The Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid, has
forecast more than 30 days of blackouts this summer due to severe shortages of
electric supply.

??Dee Ann Hendirx, 53, of San Francisco, has stocked up on candles and
battery-operated clocks.

??''I hate to say this but it's getting to be a way of life in California,''
she said.

HEADLINE: ?California Blackout Season Begins

BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN


DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

BODY:

???California's newest season blackout season is here, and it arrived earlier
than expected.

??State officials had anticipated a crunch in June, when air conditioners are
cranked up for summer weather. But already, California has been hit with
back-to-back blackouts on Monday and Tuesday, and the operators of the state's
power grid barely scraped together enough energy to avoid blackouts Wednesday.

??''We're definitely in blackout season,'' said Michael Shames, executive
director of the Utility Consumer Action Network. ''Right now, there's almost a
disbelieving frustration that is going to elevate quickly to downright 
irritable
if we go through a summer of this.''

??Grid officials expected fewer problems Thursday, when temperatures were
expected to cool slightly and a large power plant was to return to service.

??Hot weather, a high number of power plants down for maintenance and little
power available from other states led to rolling blackouts this week that
affected hundreds of thousands of customers.

??Experts expect a long, hot summer of similar drills calls for conservation,
followed by blackouts. California has had six days of rolling blackouts so far
this year, and state regulators are forecasting at least 30 more this summer.

??For consumers, the early start of the season has created a mixture of
resignation and exasperation.

??''The first day we have a hot day we have an energy crisis,'' said San
Francisco resident Dee Ann Hendrix. ''I hate to say this, but it's getting to 
be
a way of life in California.''

??Fe Burian, 46, who moved to San Francisco from the Philippines, said the
blackouts had not affected her yet, ''but I come from a Third World country 
so I
know how it is.''

??It has been a year since consumers in San Diego got the first dose of
shortages and higher costs. Since then, Gov. Gray Davis and other leaders have
tried to deal with the crisis with mixed results.

??The state has spent $4.7 billion since January to buy power for its two
largest cash-strapped utilities. On Wednesday, the Legislature approved the 
sale
of $13.4 billion in revenue bonds to buy electricity. 

??Last month, the state Public Utilities Commission approved the biggest rate
increase in California history: up to 46 percent for customers of Southern
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. 

??Under a plan proposed Wednesday by PUC President Loretta Lynch, the increase
would be structured so that residential customers who use the most 
electricity 
would face average rate hikes of 35 percent 40 percent, while industrial users
could face increases of 50 percent or more.

??In February, Davis streamlined the permit process for new power plants and
created an ambitious conservation program to head off summer blackouts.

??But the governor's plan to have 5,000 megawatts of new power online by
midsummer is unrealistic, said Michael Zenker, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, an energy consulting firm.

??''There's no basis in fact in that number. We expect between 750 to 1,000 
new
megawatts,'' he said. A megawatt is roughly enough power for 750 homes.

??Zenker's organization predicted several months ago that the state would see
200 days of severe shortages this summer and 20 days of blackouts. But since
then, the forecast has gotten bleaker because drought in the Northwest is
expected to reduce output from hydroelectric plants.

??''Any sort of warm weather will be enough to push us into blackouts,'' 
Zenker
said.

??As for conservation, it will make blackouts shorter and less severe, Shames
said, ''but it won't stop the blackouts from happening.''

??Meanwhile, a judge said Wednesday that PG&E can continue paying its natural
gas suppliers, even as other creditors wait to recoup billions of dollars from
the utility.

??The decision allows PG&E, which last month filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, to buy gas that it sells to homes and

??usinesses.

HEADLINE: Davis asks generators to 'share pain'

BYLINE: Ed Mendel

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Gov. Gray Davis met yesterday with power generators he has accused of
price-gouging and asked them to ''share in the pain'' of California's 
electricity crisis by settling for 70 percent of what they are owed by
utilities.

??The governor said he told the generators that a key part of his rescue plan
for utilities, the purchase of the Southern California Edison transmission
system by the state, might not be approved by legislators if payments to
generators are not reduced.

??Davis said he warned the generators that if Edison is forced to join Pacific
Gas and Electric in bankruptcy, the generators would probably not be paid for
three or four years and might receive even less than 70 percent of what they 
are
owed as the judge distributes payments to creditors.

??''They could just do the math,'' said Davis, ''and see the value of having a
certain amount of money this year can be higher in many cases than what you 
can
expect to get out of the bankruptcy.''

??Davis said he told the generators to be prepared to negotiate with
legislators in the next few days. He said he believes that generators 
understand
that they must reduce the amount of their current claims.

??''I think they understand they have to share in the pain,'' Davis said.
''They have to share in the solution.''

??Davis said that of the $3.5 billion that Edison owes, about $1.1 billion to
$1.2 billion is owed to generators. He said he did not have similar figures 
for
PG&E. One of the generator executives who attended the nearly four-hour 
meeting
in the governor's office did not immediately dismiss the suggestion that
generators be paid less than they are owed.

??''I wouldn't say it's completely off the table,'' said Randy Harrison, chief
executive officer of Mirant. ''I think anything that's part of a long-term
comprehensive solution might be something we could discuss at some point.''

??But another generator executive who attended the meeting disagreed with the
governor's assessment that generators at the meeting understood that they must
reduce the amount of their claims.

??''At this point we feel like we played by the rules,'' said John Stout,
Reliant senior vice president.

??It was revealed last week that Duke Energy offered a plan to provide the
state more power and to settle for less than what it was owed if all lawsuits
and investigations into price-gouging were dropped. Davis rejected the offer.

??''We are not dropping any lawsuits,'' Davis said he told generators. ''We 
are
not dropping any investigations. Quite the contrary, we are pursuing all those
to the hilt.''

??Legislators have proposed seizing the power plants of generators and 
imposing
criminal penalties for price-gouging. The Senate approved a bill this week 
that
could impose a 100 percent tax on any generator revenue of more than $80 per
megawatt hours. The state estimates that it will pay an average of $346 per
megawatt hour for power purchased on the spot market during the second quarter
of this year.

??Davis suggested a windfall-profit tax goes against his instincts, but he has
not ruled it out.

??''It would cause blackouts,'' warned Reliant's Stout.

??The meeting in the governor's office yesterday was attended by the chief
executive officers of Mirant, Enron, Edison Mission Energy, Calpine and
Williams.

??Also attending were executives from Reliant, PG&E's National Energy Group,
Duke, AES and El Paso Natural Gas. Executives from Sempra and Dynegy
participated by telephone.

??Davis said the main topic was a discussion of ways to help California meet
its energy needs this summer. He said there was an agreement to publicize the
results of power-plant inspections in response to accusations that plants are
being taken off line to drive up electricity prices.

??Stout said there was a suggestion that the state sell electricity to the
Northwest during off-peak hours to reduce the drain on hydroelectric 
facilities
there and produce revenue for California. 

??Davis said some of the suggestions from generators were ''blue-sky'' ideas.
''I have no idea if they have merit,'' he said.

??Earlier in the day, the state Senate sent Davis a bill authorizing $13.4
billion in bonds to repay the state general fund for power purchases, which
total more than $6 billion so far.

??But because Republicans refused to provide the votes needed to allow the 
bill
to take effect immediately, a special session on energy will be ended
prematurely Monday to allow the bond measure to take effect 90 days later in
August.

??Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton, D-San Francisco, said that a new
special session will be called and steps will be taken to return dozens of
stranded bills to their positions in the legislative process, avoiding the 
need
to repeat hearings and votes.

??The state began buying power for utility customers in January after PG&E and
Edison, whose rates were frozen by deregulation as wholesale power costs 
soared,
ran up a $13 billion debt and could no longer borrow.

??Davis urged Republicans to reconsider their vote and approve a bond sale
before the new fiscal year begins July 1. If the state general fund is not
repaid, he said that funding may have to be reduced for ''transportation,
hospitals, schools, the environment, law enforcement and other important''
programs.

??Assembly Republicans, who wanted to reduce the size of the bonds by not
repaying the general fund for $6.5 billion worth of power, said yesterday that
the new state budget should include a $4 billion reserve for power purchases.

??The Assembly GOP point man on the budget, George Runner of Lancaster, said 
he
fears that the situation is deteriorating and that California may have to
consider rationing the amount of electricity. 

??''I believe we are coming very closely to this line that we are no longer
dealing with conservation issues we are dealing with rationing,'' Runner said.

??In other action yesterday:

???Legislation that would allow San Diego County to form its own municipal
utility district cleared a key hurdle after the bill's author, Assemblyman 
Mark
Wyland, R-Escondido, agreed to require voter approval for any new district.

??The bill, which has bipartisan support from the San Diego delegation, would
require majority approval before a district could be formed. Current law
requires a two-thirds vote.

???Loretta Lynch, chairwoman of the California Public Utilities, said she 
hopes
to spare 50 percent of residential power users from any increases under the
pending rate hikes for PG&E and Edison.

??The hikes, which amount to about 3 cents per kilowatt hour and raise about 
$5
billion annually to cover power costs, will be formally approved Monday by the
commission. Lynch's proposal, which she released yesterday, is one of several
for allocating the increase and calls for heavier electricity users to pay 
more
than moderate users.

??SDG&E's request for a rate hike will be considered later.

HEADLINE: Bush Energy Stance Begins to Worry Some in GOP

BYLINE: GREG MILLER, RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

??As power shortages and price spikes spread beyond California, congressional
Republicans are beginning to worry that the Bush administration's reluctance 
to
offer much immediate relief could hurt the party in the 2002 elections.

??A national energy plan to be unveiled by the White House next week will 
focus
on long-term strategies. But with California and other states bracing for a
summer of electricity turmoil and gasoline prices surging across the country,
some GOP lawmakers are pressing for short-term solutions.

??""The White House has been taking a look at the big picture,"" said a GOP
leadership aide in the House. ""But they're going to be around in four years. 
We
might not have members around in two years if we don't show we care.""

??That sentiment is being voiced by a rising number of GOP lawmakers. ""We're 
in
a crisis situation, which is only going to get worse if we don't act very
aggressively,"" Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said Wednesday. Gallegly is
one of four congressional Republicans from California to break with the
administration by supporting temporary price controls on wholesale 
electricity.

??The rising anxiety, which has begun spreading beyond the California 
delegation, underscores how much has changed since the state declared its 
first
Stage 3 power emergency in December. At that time, Congress' response was
largely: That's Gov. Gray Davis' problem.

??Not anymore.

??Thirty-nine Stage 3 alerts later, a House committee today will take up a
GOP-drafted emergency bill that would, among other things, allow Davis to
temporarily waive certain emission standards for power plants during an
emergency and provide federal aid to relieve a notorious bottleneck in the
California power grid.

??But some GOP lawmakers say the legislation doesn't go far enough, and plan 
to
offer amendments containing their own ideas. Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs)
plans to push for $100 million in energy assistance to low-income households 
and
for a directive to federal facilities in the West to cut energy use by 20%.

??""House leaders recognize that they could lose the House in California if
there's not an action plan that members can campaign on,"" said Scott Reed, a 
GOP
strategist.

??As lawmakers search for ways to provide immediate relief, the White House
continues to cite California's troubles as evidence of the need to upgrade an
aging, overburdened electricity transmission system.

??Responding to reports that the administration would propose legislation to
give the federal government eminent domain authority in siting power lines,
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush wants to ensure that the
distribution infrastructure can move electricity from regions with surpluses 
to
regions that need more power.

??""That's one of the reasons that California is going through the difficulties
it's going through,"" Fleischer said. ""There is energy available in other parts
of the country, but it can't be shipped to California as easily as you would
hope, because of infrastructure problems.""

??Fleischer took exception to a front-page story in The Times reporting that
Bush, in a speech delivered Tuesday, ""offered no hint of what his 
administration
might do"" to help California avert a possible economic downturn caused by 
power
blackouts.

??Though the president did not specifically mention possible actions in the
speech, Fleischer said Bush last week ""announced a series of steps, including
conservation,"" to help California get through an energy crisis this summer.

??He said that the Pentagon is reducing its energy needs within California by
10% and that all other federal agencies, at Bush's direction, are reviewing
their energy consumption patterns.

??Environmentalists already have begun blasting the administration's energy
plan--even before its details are made public--for what they characterize as a
failure to emphasize energy efficiency and investments in renewable fuels.

??Activists Say Crisis Isn't Real

??At a Wednesday news briefing, a coalition of environmental advocates
disagreed with the administration's assertion that the country is experiencing
an energy ""crisis,"" and accused it of crafting a plan designed to boost the
profits of key campaign contributors.

??""We cannot drill our way out of this situation,"" said Dan Becker of the
Sierra Club. He and others argued that conserving fuel--with cars that use 
less
gasoline and appliances that use less electricity, for example--is the best 
way
to avoid energy shortages in the short term.

??So far, it is not clear whether the energy crisis will work to either 
party's
advantage. Many on Capitol Hill are bracing for an election year that could be
brutal for incumbents of both parties if voters who endure high energy bills
this summer vent their frustration in the voting booth next year.

??Some House Republicans acknowledged that they have been pushing the White
House to appear more engaged in finding near-term solutions.

??When House Republicans met with Cheney last week, ""they urged him and all 
the
administration to at least make it clear that a lot of effort is going into
finding a way to solve the problem,"" said Jim Specht, a spokesman for Rep. 
Jerry
Lewis (R-Redlands), leader of the California GOP delegation.

??Though some Republicans have offered ideas to address the immediate problem,
it is not clear whether any will receive congressional approval.

??Indeed, the emergency assistance bill being taken up today by the House
energy subcommittee faces trouble, although it was drafted by the panel's
chairman, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas).

??Barton stripped out a number of provisions opposed by environmentalists. But
Democrats plan to seek a vote on capping wholesale electricity prices, a
proposal most Republicans oppose. Democrats also plan to introduce an 
amendment
to target natural gas prices.

??House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) said the bill ""fails
miserably"" to address California's problems. ""During the campaign, President
Bush promised a sensible energy policy,"" Gephardt said. ""In recent weeks,
however, the president has responded to the gathering crisis by throwing up 
his
hands and saying there's nothing we can do, there's no way to give people
immediate relief from blackouts and sky-high increases of price of gasoline at
the pump.""

??Lawmakers of both parties acknowledge that they are hearing a rising chorus
of constituent complaints about the energy price spikes and supply shortages.

??Rep. Chris Cox (R-Newport Beach) was caught in a blackout during a tour of a
computer chip factory in his district. ""They said it cost them $1 million if 
the
power goes off even for five minutes,"" said Cox, who nonetheless opposes price
controls.

??Cox said he is worried about how the California electricity crisis might
affect the national economy. He said that when he asks business owners about
expanding in California, ""they just look at you like you're nuts. They don't
consider California an option because of this uncertainty.""

??""People come up to you and want you to help solve the problem,"" said Rep.
George Radanovich (R-Mariposa).

??He has explained that there is little the federal government can do in the
short term.

??""Californians want somebody to do something,"" said John J. Pitney Jr.,
associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. ""When people 
are
in a mood like that, politicians get nervous thinking that they're the ones 
who
might get blamed.""

??Said Reed, the GOP strategist: ""Every incumbent in California is vulnerable
in the next election, in both parties. This is an issue that is not 
ideological.
It's about action and solving a short-term problem. ""Politics have taken over
this issue, like it or not,"" he said. ""They may have been raging in California
for the last three or four months. It's now a national political issue.""

HEADLINE: Rate Hikes Up to 60% Proposed by PUC Chief;
Power: Lynch says about half the residential customers of Edison, PG&E would
escape increases. Her plan draws fire from all sides.

BYLINE: TIM REITERMAN, NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

??About 4 million California residential electricity customers will face
increases in their monthly bills of up to about 60% under a proposal unveiled
Wednesday by the state's chief utility regulator. Interest groups on all sides
promptly condemned the plan as too hard on either consumers or businesses.

??The proposal by California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta
Lynch would increase the bills of roughly half of Southern California Edison's
residential customers, who consume medium to heavy amounts, by $8 to $93 a
month. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers would be hit with hikes of $6 to 
$87
a month.

??About half of the residential customers of the state's two biggest public
utilities would see no increase under the proposal if they continued to 
consume
energy at their current pace.

??Lynch said she could not guarantee that more rate increases would not be
necessary. ""Even these astronomical average rates may prove inadequate,"" she
said, noting that wholesale electricity prices are still high and 
unpredictable.
??The rate hike, Lynch said at a news conference, is necessary because 
""federal
regulators have failed to follow federal laws to ensure just and reasonable
prices.""

??The deepening energy crisis compelled Lynch to release her proposal after
public hearings on the rate increase already had begun. Lynch said that she
wished her proposal had been ready sooner, but that at least some of the
remaining public hearings will have the benefit of reviewing it.

??PUC passage of the essential elements of Lynch's plan seems likely.

??Along with two of her colleagues on the five-member commission, Lynch was
appointed by Gov. Gray Davis, and they often vote as a bloc. Lynch said,
however, that testimony later this week from utilities, the public and other
interested parties could prompt modifications.

??Structuring the $5-billion rate increase is an important but politically
sensitive step in California's attempt to restore stability to the delivery of
power to 9 million customers of two financially troubled utilities while
protecting the state budget.

??The PUC has tried to design rates that would encourage conservation without
damaging business. Competing interest groups, ranging from consumer advocates 
to
large manufacturers, have been jockeying for advantage for weeks.

??The PUC approved a rate increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour March 27 to
help pay the state's mounting power tab, which now exceeds $5 billion. This
week, the commission is conducting statewide hearings on how the pain should 
be
shared among millions of residents and businesses. On Monday the panel is set 
to
vote on Lynch's plan and a similar one by a PUC administrative law judge.

??Neither proposal appeared to please anyone.

??""The PUC says everyone should share the pain, but we think the fair share of
the pain for residential consumers should be zero,"" said Mindy Spatt,
spokeswoman for the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer group. 
""It
should be paid by commercial and industrial customers who wanted and still 
want
deregulation.""

??Consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield said regulators should go after power
generators and their hefty profits rather than ratepayers.

??""Rate increases are not the answer, and this is not going to be the end of
them,"" said Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights in Santa Monica. ""This is like organized crime: The more you give them,
the more they want.""

??Commercial and industrial customers would see increases of up to 50%, and
agricultural interests would face increases of 23% to 30% under Lynch's
proposal.

??Business interests contend that the rate hikes hit them much harder than
residential users.

??Calling the proposal ""a death knell for the California economy,"" Jack M.
Stewart of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn. estimated that
industrial customers would see their power rates increase an average of 53%. 
And
the pain of the rate hikes will be compounded by blackouts this summer, which
the group contends will cost California businesses $21.8 billion in lost
productivity.

??""For most large manufacturers, energy is a large piece of their operating
costs,"" Stewart said. ""If you add 53% to that, it's going to severely hamper
their ability to do business.""

??Unlike residential customers, the business customers are not grouped into
tiers based on their amount of usage. Lynch said there was insufficient time 
to
establish a tiering system for nonresidential customers by June 1, when the 
rate
hikes will start showing up on bills.

??An earlier proposal by Lynch had attempted to narrow the gap between
residential rates and the lower rates paid by nonresidential customers. But 
the
commission president said that goal could not be immediately achieved without
seriously damaging the state's economy.

??To protect the largest users from gigantic rate increases, Lynch's proposal
caps the maximum bill increase at 300% for most customers and 250% for
agricultural customers.

??""While we understand bill limiters may have some troubling conservation
impacts, at some point, price signals are unbearable for customers. Bill
limiters will protect customers from unanticipated extraordinary bill 
impacts,""
Lynch wrote.

??In recent weeks, the commission has received about 20 plans for structuring
the rate increase, including one from Davis, who had proposed a slightly 
smaller
overall rate increase. Lynch said her plan incorporates a number of features 
of
the governor's plan, including a tiered structure that would punish heavy 
users
and reward those who conserve.

??Under state legislation, there is no rate increase for consumption up to 
130%
of baseline, the amount deemed the minimum needed by a customer in a given 
area
and noted on ratepayer bills. Also exempted are low-income customers who 
already
receive discounted electricity rates.

??Edison and PG&E said they could not assess how the PUC proposals would 
affect
their customers because the commission had not provided details to the 
utilities
as of late Wednesday.

??But PG&E has disputed the commission's claim that half of customers would 
not
be affected by the increase, noting that only 32% of PG&E customers never
exceeded 130% of baseline usage in the last year.

??Industrial and commercial customers complained that the plan should not
exempt such a large group of residential customers, in any event. A rate
increase for these users--based on the PUC's estimate that the group will
constitute about half of residential customers--could generate an extra $1
billion.

??If the PUC insists on exempting so many, the $1-billion shortfall should be
covered solely by other residential users, businesses say.

??Under Lynch's plan the burden of paying that amount would be split equally
among commercial, industrial and nonexempt residential customers.

??If covering the shortfall were not shared by the three groups, Lynch said,
some residential customers would suffer a 100% increase in their bills.

??The proposal calls for a pilot program, including one that would let federal
agencies based in California ""experiment with their own market rate policies.""

??Lynch challenged federal agencies to try to live with ""real time,"" or 
hourly,
prices in the volatile wholesale marketplace--a slap at officials of the 
Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission who favor a free wholesale market over price 
caps.
Use of real-time pricing requires installing a special meter.

??""'It would be great if the federal users respond to price signals enough 
that
prices come down,"" Lynch said, adding that she was skeptical that would happen
in today's dysfunctional market.

??A FERC spokeswoman declined to comment on Lynch's proposal.

??During the third day of PUC hearings, about 200 people gathered at Fullerton
College. Seventy people testified, most venting their anger at elected 
officials
and utility companies, whom they blame for the state's flawed deregulation 
plan.

??""I am opposed to any rate increase for residences and small business,""
testified Ruth Shapin, a Santa Ana attorney. ""This crisis was created by
politicians. PG&E and SCE have transferred billions of dollars to their parent
companies. Let them bail themselves out, not the ratepayers.""

??Others said the baselines might be unfair because the commission had not
taken into consideration home size, the number of occupants and the location.

??""It's going to be hard for many people to stay below the 130% baseline,"" 
said
Sylvia Hartman of Lakewood. ""Some customers could easily go 400% over the
baseline.""

;
Governor Asks Generators to Take Less Than They're Owed;
Power: Meeting with firms, Davis says that settling for 70% of debt would help
Edison stay solvent. One executive bristles.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??After spending months bashing independent power generators, Gov. Gray Davis 
on Wednesday called on them to take 30% less than the $1.2 billion they are 
owed
by Southern California Edison.

??""The Legislature [is] going to insist on a reduction,"" Davis said after a
meeting in his office with representatives of a dozen power generating
companies. Davis said he told them that ""70% this year was more valuable to 
them
than whatever they get two or three years down the line"" if Edison is forced
into bankruptcy.

??Davis urged generators to help California extricate itself from a summer of
rolling blackouts by selling every available electron to the state.

??He held out the possibility that he might sign legislation imposing a
windfall profits tax on generators if they fail to help out this summer.

??""My attitude on that would depend a lot on whether they showed good faith 
and
cooperated throughout this process,"" Davis said, emerging after a four-hour,
closed-door meeting with the generators.

??The Democratic governor issued an invitation last week to the chief 
executive
officers of power generating and marketing companies including Enron, 
Reliant, 
Duke Energy and others to meet with him in Sacramento. But most of the
executives who attended were a few pay grades below CEO.

??Davis said he urged that the executives press lawmakers to approve the deal
he struck with Edison in which the state would give the ailing utility an
infusion of cash by buying its transmission system for $2.76 billion. Edison
would use the money to restructure its debt and pay its creditors.

??Davis said lawmakers will not approve the deal unless the independent power
generators take less than they are owed.

??He noted that the state and the power generators have ""a collective interest
in seeing that this summer has as few disruptions as possible."" If California 
is
hit with repeated blackouts, Davis has said, other states will delay or end
efforts to deregulate their electricity markets.

??Executives, who braved taunts from a few protesters wearing pig masks and
carrying a small but loudly squealing pig, characterized the meeting as
businesslike. But at least some generators are less than enthusiastic about
taking less than they are owed.

??""I have a real concern about the notion that we should give back some of the
money we made,"" said John Stout, a senior vice president of the Houston-based
Reliant Energy, which says it is owed $300 million by Southern California 
Edison
and Pacific Gas & Electric. 

??Stout said that much of the money Reliant made in California is being
reinvested in power plant construction--although he added that the company has
no generators under construction in California. 

??""Political uncertainty has put a huge risk factor on investment in
California,"" Stout said.

??Randy Harrison, an executive with Mirant, based in Atlanta, said the issue 
of
a so-called ""haircut"" was discussed, though not in detail. Harrison said it is
""not completely off the table."" But he added that his company is not
profiteering. Nor has it withheld electricity in any attempt to manipulate
wholesale energy prices.

??""Our people are working 24 hours a day and we are spending millions of
dollars to try and keep our power plants up and running,"" Harrison said.

??The meeting was aimed at opening communication with the generators. But 
Davis
aides said the governor also wanted to bring attention to companies that he
believes are at least partly responsible for California's energy crisis.

??The meeting occurred as polls show that voters are increasingly angry about
the energy crisis and as lawmakers, fearful that the energy crisis will wreck
California's economy, sharpen their attacks on power generators.

??Legislators have introduced bills to impose a windfall profits tax on
generators and make it a felony to manipulate electricity markets. Lt. Gov. 
Cruz
Bustamante and Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews (D-Tracy) sued several 
generators
last week. Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer is investigating whether generators 
violated
antitrust and other laws as wholesale prices soared to record heights, 
hobbling
Edison and helping push PG&E into bankruptcy.

??Voters are not sure who is to blame, but they are convinced that ""whoever is
taking our money is taking way too much,"" said Democratic political consultant
Richie Ross.

??""They want to find this deregulation's Charles Keating,"" Ross said, 
referring
to a central figure in the 1980s savings and loan debacle.

??Still, as much as Davis and others demonize generators, the state needs 
them,
some officials say.

??""We don't have enough power without them,"" said Assembly Energy Committee
Chairman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles). ""There needs to be an adult 
discussion
to see what can be worked out.""

Time to Give Some of the Power Players a Haircut

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Gray and the Grid. Sounds like an old rock group. And it's slipping fast on
the Capitol charts.

??Same with MOU. That's not a rapper, but it's making about as much sense to
most legislators.

??MOU--Memo of Understanding--is the complex deal Gov. Gray Davis cut with
Southern California Edison last month to rescue the utility from bankruptcy. 
The
key provision is Davis' offer to buy Edison's high-voltage lines--its 
grid--for
$2.76 billion.

??Of that, $1.5 billion would go to Edison's creditors, the electricity
suppliers the utility has stiffed. Edison customers would kick in another $2
billion to pay off the total debt, estimated at $3.5 billion.

??The state would repair and expand the clogged grid--for less money than
Edison could--and collect transmission fees to pay for the lines. It also 
would
be in better position to possibly buy bankrupt PG&E's lines and ultimately 
place
the entire California grid under public ownership.

??Problem is, this deal must be approved by the Legislature. And the governor
can't even find a lawmaker willing to sponsor the bill.

??Politicians have looked at polls and seen that voters regard private
utilities as the No. 1 villain in this energy mugging. They're leery of
supporting anything that might smack of a public bailout for Edison.

??""It's seen as a gift,"" Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) says of
the MOU.

??The Davis deal seems DOA. So both legislative houses are drafting
alternatives.

??Most Democrats--who own Sacramento--think the creditors should ""take a
haircut."" That's Capitol jargon for discounting the debt.

??Burton figures that a 30% haircut will be necessary for any Edison deal.
That's justified, he and others say, because the creditors--mainly 
out-of-state
power companies--have been gouging the utilities anyway.

??On Wednesday, Davis agreed. He proposed a 30% haircut in a meeting with
stunned power generators, who had little response.

??There must be shared pain, Davis and Burton assert. Shared by creditors,
Edison's parent company, the utility itself and ratepayers. Under the MOU, 
only
ratepayers suffer pain.

??The liberal Senate leader was an early advocate of acquiring the grid. And 
he
still is. But he asserts this MOU isn't needed for that. Perhaps the grid can 
be
picked up as a separate ticket.

??Across the Capitol, freshman Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los
Angeles)--the former L.A. council member--has been meeting with a small group
that is looking for alternatives to the Davis deal.

??""It's uncertain whether we can pass the MOU in its current form,"" she says.
""But nobody wants to leave this hanging in limbo.""

??Among the options, she says, is acquiring the grid without paying for it.
Edison would just shift title. That way there'd be no legislative haggling 
over
price.

??But the state would take care of the utility's debts after creditor 
haircuts.
Good trims.

??""There's no definition of gouging that wouldn't be appropriate here,""
Goldberg says.

??""Maybe the governor could have moved faster. There are a lot of shouldas,
wouldas. But when I get angry, I get angry at FERC and the price gougers.""

??FERC and the Price Gougers--at the very bottom of the Capitol charts.

??Burton and Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) announced plans
Monday to sue the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They want to force 
FERC
to protect California consumers against the gougers. Obey the law and make 
sure
the power pirates charge only ""just and reasonable"" prices. Return unfair
profits. Set wholesale price caps.

??""This case is about old people in convalescent homes, which are not exempt
from blackouts,"" said the legislators' veteran trial attorney, Joseph 
Cotchett.
""We're talking about health and welfare. People on life support machines. This
is not about swimming pool heaters.""

??It's a longshot suit--two legislative leaders suing the federal government.
There's a doctrine about separation of powers. But the action illustrates
Sacramento's current frustration.

??On Wednesday, there was a new group: Gray and the Generators.

??The governor invited in the gougers for some frank talk in his office.
Earlier, he had accused them of ""just satisfying their greed and sucking money
out of the state.""

??They weren't in the mood for a Capitol haircut.

??But one power official confided that many do wish FERC would be more
aggressive--set hard rules, order refunds if justified and just handle it. The
state Capitol wouldn't be so overheated and there'd be less pressure on the
generators if the Feds did their job.

??In that regard, Californians now are beginning to discover another group:
Bush and the Blackouts.

??The boos are becoming more raucous.

HEADLINE: Davis Faces Budget Cuts, Report Says;
Finance: The state surplus shrinks by $3.4 billion as tech-firm troubles 
reduce
tax revenue. Meanwhile, spending on the energy crisis mounts.

BYLINE: JULIE TAMAKI MIGUEL BUSTILLO, CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??The suffering of California's high-tech firms is taking its toll on the
fortunes of state government, according to the nonpartisan legislative 
analyst,
who said Wednesday that the state budget surplus has shrunk by $3.4 billion.

??To keep the budget out of the red, Gov. Gray Davis will have to slash his
state spending plan, an unpleasant prospect for those who rely on state 
services
and a politically dicey task for a governor facing reelection next year. Among
the areas that could be hit are anticipated transportation projects and a
program to extend health insurance to poor people.

??Elizabeth Hill's grim update on the state's financial outlook complicates an
already difficult situation for state officials trying to pay for services 
amid
an extraordinarily expensive energy crisis. More than $6 billion has been
drained from California coffers to pay for energy purchases. Hill's assessment
of the state economy and its effect on the budget does not take that money 
into
account because it assumes that a bond issue, approved Wednesday, will repay 
the
state's general fund.

??Should that fall through, her budget estimates would grow more dire.

??Hill's office previously estimated an $8-billion state surplus over this 
year
and next. But California has been particularly hard-hit by the struggles of 
the
state's high-tech firms, which in recent years had fueled huge state tax
receipts as employees cashed out stock options, said Brad Williams, senior
economist for Hill's office.

??""This shouldn't be too terribly surprising given the negative developments 
in
the economy and the negative developments in the stock market,"" Williams said.
""The economic picture has changed significantly since January.""

??In a letter to lawmakers, Hill said onetime and ongoing spending cuts will 
be
needed to stave off a deficit that would occur if the governor's spending plan
were put in place. Under that plan, money would be spent faster than it would
come in, according to Hill's projections.

??At the rate of spending contemplated by the governor's current budget
proposal, the deficit would hit $1.5 billion in the 2001-02 budget year and 
rise
to $6 billion by 2002-03, Hill predicted. To avoid running into the red, Hill
floated the possibility of $2.5 billion in onetime cuts in the next budget and
an annual reduction of $1.7 billion through the 2002-03 fiscal year.

??Department of Finance spokesman Sandy Harrison said the Davis administration
would not comment on Hill's projection Wednesday, adding only that the 
governor
would account for updated revenue estimates Monday when he releases his 
revised
spending plan.

??But lawmakers are reacting with alarm and are vowing to cut whatever 
programs
are expendable to avoid what some consider the worst alternative: a tax
increase.

??""That's the last thing we want to do,"" said Assembly Budget Committee
Chairman Tony Cardenas (D-Sylmar). ""It has crossed our minds. We do not like 
the
fact that it has crossed our minds.""

??Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) said the nearly $
5-billion shortfall that Hill predicts for the 2001-02 fiscal year is
optimistic. He believes revenue actually could sink as much as $20 billion.

??Peace said Hill appears to be projecting that revenue will begin to rebound
toward the end of the year, but he predicted a continued decline as the 
economic
downturn manifesting itself on Wall Street trickles down to Main Street.

??""I think we are in for a huge problem and that assumes no impact from the
energy stuff,"" Peace said.

??Though legislators appear most determined to avoid a tax increase, cutting
services would represent a political challenge.

??Peace suggested that up to $2 billion could be saved by delaying certain
onetime transportation programs that have yet to get off the ground. He warned
that a proposed expansion of the Healthy Families program, which provides 
health
insurance to low-income Californians, could be in jeopardy.

??Education funding in the upcoming budget year probably will still rise over
the previous year, but fall short of the level contemplated by Davis in 
January
by about half a billion dollars, Peace predicted.

??Davis' $1.45-billion, three-year plan to extend the middle school year has
faced substantial opposition in the Legislature and may be rejected, which 
would
relieve the need to cut other programs.

??Without question, the biggest cloud hanging over the budget is whether the
general fund will be repaid for billions of dollars in energy purchases--a
possibility that is quickly dismissed in Hill's analysis.

??To avoid blackouts, California has been buying massive quantities of
electricity since January because the state's private utilities had become too
burdened with debt to continue making purchases on the expensive wholesale 
power
market.

??Davis had planned to reimburse the budget with proceeds from a record $
12.5-billion bond sale and that utility ratepayers would then pay off the 
bonds.
But the sale has been delayed until August at the earliest, leaving a gaping
hole in state coffers as lawmakers plan the budget.

??Cardenas said it is likely that legislators will be forced to craft a
two-tiered budget this year, one that assumes a bond sale is completed and one
that prepares for the possibility it is not.

??There are other uncertainties as well. Consumer activists say they are
considering challenging the bond issue with a ballot measure--a threat that
could further undermine confidence about the bond issue, and California's
financial health, on Wall Street. California's credit rating has already been
lowered by one credit rating agency because of concerns over repayment of the
state budget.

??If the bond issue does not go through, ""then we have to make cuts
everywhere,"" Cardenas said. ""Everything is up for grabs.""

HEADLINE: California Seeks Power Debt Relief

BYLINE: ?AP

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, May 9

BODY:

??Gov. Gray Davis asked power generators today to accept a 30 percent cut in
money they are owed by Southern California Edison, the state's second largest
utility, to help keep it afloat.

??The California governor's request came after two days of rolling blackouts
caused by high temperatures and scarce electricity. Grid operators avoided
blackouts today after temperatures dropped slightly.

???Officials at the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's
electricity grid, said that supplies would still be tight on Thursday, but 
that
slightly cooler weather would help them meet demand.

??Southern California Edison owes generators more than $1.1 billion, but they
are unlikely to see their money for years if it declares bankruptcy, Mr. Davis
said he told 12 electricity and natural gas producers.

??""I think they understand they have to share in the pain,"" the governor said.
""They have to share in the solution. I believe they are willing to take some
reduction in the amount of money they are currently claiming.""

??So far no one is volunteering to forgive the debts.

??Southern California air regulators are close to slashing their market-based
system for controlling power plant pollution. The move is intended to allow
large power plants to operate at full capacity without facing stiff fines as
they try to meet demand.

??The change was promoted by an executive order from Governor Davis requiring
air districts to let large generators run at the greatest capacity.

HEADLINE: Power bills set to skyrocket for heavy users;

Graduated rate increase would take effect in June

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: David Lazarus

BODY:
As state regulators outlined plans to raise residential electricity bills by 
as
much as 40 percent, the head of the Public Utilities Commission warned 
yesterday
that power rates could soar even higher.

???The PUC, which adopted an increase in March, is scheduled to approve 
details
of the new rates in San Francisco on Monday. Consumers will see the higher 
rates
in their June utility bills.

???State regulators say nearly half of all consumers will see no change in
their power bills. The remainder will experience rate increases ranging from 3
percent to more than 50 percent, depending on the type of customer and the
amount of power used.

???The increases would be added to an average 10 percent increase adopted in
January.

???PUC President Loretta Lynch suggested that rates could rise yet again if
wholesale electricity prices continue to surge this summer.

???""If the sellers decide to turn up the heat and raise prices, we'll have to
look again at the numbers,"" she said.

???INCREASE WILL CONTRIBUTE LITTLE

???The proposed rate increase would bring in about $5 billion annually -- a
fraction of the estimated $65 billion California will spend this year 
purchasing
power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities.

???Lynch said she expects the remainder to be made up by issuing bonds. The
state Senate yesterday approved $13.4 billion in bonds to help cover
California's power costs.

???However, those bonds would not be released until August, by which time
California's energy tab would be billions of dollars higher.

???""There's huge cause for concern that this latest rate increase is a down
payment rather than anything close to a final installment,"" said Bob
Finkelstein, staff attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco.

???The PUC's Lynch stressed that while California's new rate structure would
place a greater burden on the state's heaviest power users, the increases are
intended to spread the pain among all consumers.

???""Energy is expensive for every hour of every day for every customer,"" she
said.

???LINING UP TO GET PAID

???That includes the state Department of Water Resources, which is spending
about $70 million a day to keep California's lights on.

???While the PUC is moving to have more money collected from consumers to pay
California's power bills, it has yet to address the thorny question of how the
proceeds will be distributed among the various parties lined up for
compensation.

???The Water Resources Department wants all rate-related revenues to first
replenish state coffers, while Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison Co. insist that they be paid as well for their own expenses.

???The utilities' costs include payments to small power generators that can no
longer afford natural gas to run their plants. The recent closure of hundreds 
of
such facilities is a key reason California is experiencing blackouts this 
week.

???Although PG&E said yesterday that most of the smaller generators with which
it does business are now back online, it is not yet clear whether the utility
will be able to keep paying for their power.

???""It appears that everything (from the rate increase) is going to DWR (the
Water Resources Department),"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman.

???Lynch said the PUC will take up the matter of apportioning funds at an
unspecified future date.

???CONSERVATIVE USE PAYS

???For the moment, state regulators have their hands full digesting two
competing -- and highly complex -- proposals for how rates should be increased
next week.

???One proposal was submitted by an administrative law judge working with the
PUC and the other by Lynch. Commissioners will choose between them on Monday.

???The two proposals are largely identical. Under both, residential customers
who can keep electricity usage within 130 percent of predetermined limits 
would
experience no rate increase.

???The ""baseline usage"" figure -- included near the bottom of PG&E bills --
represents the minimal amount of power consumers require. It includes a number
of variables, such as climate, time of year and type of fuel used.

???The PUC said about half of all utility customers statewide historically 
stay
within 130 percent of baseline limits.

???Heavy residential users whose electricity usage tops 400 percent of 
baseline
figures would see power bills rise by as much as 40 percent. Heavy commercial
and industrial users would see bills rise by more than 50 percent.

???The average increase for all PG&E residential customers would be about 16
percent, the PUC said, although this number is skewed by the addition of all
those customers whose bills would remain unchanged.

???Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights
in Santa Monica, questioned whether these rate increases will be sufficient to
motivate greater conservation among consumers and thus ease California's 
energy
woes.

???He called instead for the state's political leaders to seize generating
plants from out-of-state power companies and impose a special tax on the
companies' ""windfall"" profits.

???""Unless our elected officials take action, this is just the beginning of 
our
rate increases,"" Rosenfield warned.

???FEDERAL BUILDINGS IN SIGHTS

???One of the main differences between the two rate-increase proposals is
Lynch's inclusion of a ""real-time pricing program"" for federal agencies.

???If enacted, she said, federal buildings in California would be fully 
exposed
to the volatile wholesale power market and would pay whatever California pays 
to
keep the lights on throughout the day.

???Lynch denied that this is an effort on the part of California officials to
drive home to federal authorities the impact of sky-high wholesale 
electricity 
prices.

???""It's just an experiment,"" she said.

???While California officials have called on federal regulators and the Bush
administration to assist the state by capping wholesale power prices, 
Washington
has provided only limited relief to date.

???The Utility Reform Network's Finkelstein complained that the proposed rate
increases place a severe burden on residential customers when commercial and
industrial users account for the greater percentage of power consumption.

???""It was the commercial and industrial customers who were clamoring for
deregulation,"" he said. ""You didn't hear any calls for deregulation from
residential customers.""

???Lynch said she was aware that residential users are being asked to carry a
high proportion of the load but said efforts to force industrial users to pay
higher rates ran into political opposition.E-mail David Lazarus at

",Karen,,FYI ASAP
576,"The following are my thoughts on how we should proceed this Fall.  
this is a first cut to stimulate discussion, and I welcome any suggestions, 
criticisms, or changes.   We ended this year with a relatively positive image 
of Enron by the legislature.  We have good relationships with leaders on both 
sides of the aisle.  Steve Peace's power has diminished greatly.  We have 
developed a good working relationship with Debra Bowen and her staff, who, as 
of now, will continue as chair of Senate Energy and we have a vastly improved 
our relationship with Rod Wright, to the point where he will not have a 
meeting on contentious legislation, unless we are involved (his public 
purpose bill, was an example from this year's session, we started out 
opposing it and ended up supporting it) He was also a coauthor and 
instramental in passing the  Williamson Act Bill.  Leadership in both houses 
should stay the same, although there will be 36 new members in the two 
houses, thanks to term limits.  I have spent time getting to know those who 
are in secure races and making sure they know Enron.
  In light of developing a strategy for California, I feel it needs to be 
broken into the following components:
       A session on what we see as the issues that will be facing us this 
fall and next  year in the legislative and regulatory arena.  I see the 
following as highly probably in Sacramento and there may be more.

                    11.5-megawatt Madison Windpower Project in
                    Madison County, New York with a ribbon-cutting
                    ceremony today and a community open house
                    tomorrow. 

                    ""Madison Windpower's commercial operation is a
                    milestone for us,"" said PG&E National Energy
                    Group President and Chief Operating Officer Chris
                    Iribe. ""Aside from offering critical additional capacity
                    to the New York State power market, we're
                    pioneering a new approach to linking customers to
                    new, renewable energy facilities."" 

                    The seven-turbine facility, the first of its kind east of
                    the Mississippi River, will sell electricity into the
                    Northeast power grid through the New York State
                    Electric & Gas Transmission System and the New
                    York Independent System Operator (ISO). 

                    The company will also offer Pure Wind(SM)
                    certificates to interested customers. Pure
                    Wind(SM) certificates correspond to the
                    environmental attributes associated with equivalent
                    amounts of wind-generated electricity delivered to
                    the New York power pool. 

                    Because wind-generated electricity has no air
                    emissions, the avoided emissions may be
                    compared to the pollution emitted by the average of
                    all New York State power generation facilities. On
                    this basis, total electricity output for the Madison
                    Windpower facility in an average year will avoid
                    12,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), 65 tons of
                    sulfur dioxide (SO2), and 19 tons of nitrogen oxide
                    (NOx). 

                    Pure Wind(SM) certificates will also be available to
                    consumers through a web-based sales site at
                    http://www.purewind.net, currently under
                    development. 

                    ""Wind power is a commercially available,
                    economically viable and completely renewable
                    energy source,"" said Iribe. ""This project puts
                    Madison on the map as an innovative leader in the
                    development of renewable energy; and by
                    supporting this project, New York has jumped to the
                    forefront in demonstrating its commitment to
                    improved air quality,"" he added. 

                    To further the process of bringing renewable power
                    to New York State, the New York State Energy
                    Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA)
                    awarded the Madison Windpower Project a
                    research and development contract. 

                    ""As NYSERDA celebrates its 25th anniversary this
                    week, how fitting it is for us to be here today
                    celebrating the opening of the largest wind power
                    plant in the Northeast,"" said Parker D. Mathusa, a
                    member of NYSERDA's Board of Directors.
                    ""NYSERDA's mission over those years has been to
                    use innovation and technology to help solve the
                    State's energy and environmental problems, which
                    is exactly what we are doing here today as we bring
                    clean power to the market place."" 

                    The Madison project joins one of the nation's
                    fast-growing power generation sectors. According to
                    the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA),
                    capacity from windpower plants has nearly doubled
                    in the last 10 years. Currently, installed windpower
                    facilities supply nearly 2,650 megawatts of capacity
                    to U.S. markets. 

                    With wind speeds between eight and twenty miles
                    per hour, Madison will supply enough emission-free
                    electricity to power approximately 10,000 homes. 

                    PG&E Corporation with 1999 revenues of nearly $21
                    billion and operations in 21 states, markets energy
                    services and products throughout North America
                    through its National Energy Group. 

                    The Corporation has ownership and management
                    interests in 30 operating electric power generating
                    plants in 10 states, providing it with a generation
                    portfolio of more than 7,000 megawatts and more
                    than 10,000 megawatts in new power plant
                    development and construction currently underway. It
                    also has one of the largest energy trading and risk
                    management programs in North America.

Power deregulation backfires in infancy (9.27.2000)
MANY OFFICIALS SAY IT WILL WORK EVENTUALLY 
BY STEVE JOHNSON
Mercury News 
With its residents reeling from surging summertime electricity bills, this 
coastal state's deregulated energy market has triggered bitter accusations, 
legislative hearings and a push to re-regulate the whole system. 
Sound familiar? Except this isn't California. It's New York, one of 23 other 
states that are ending what has been for decades one of government's key 
functions -- keeping tight control on the price of power. 
The great national experiment to open the sale of electricity to competition, 
which California has been largely credited with pioneering, was supposed to 
lower prices by freeing consumers from the monopolistic grip of government 
regulated utilities. Indeed, energy officials in many states retain hope that 
it eventually will do that. 
But throughout the country, a sense of foreboding has overtaken people like 
Susan Peckman, who manages Peckman's Liquor Store in Pearl River, N.Y. Hers 
is the only state outside California so far where consumers have been exposed 
to the discomfitting impact of fully deregulated prices. And she doesn't feel 
liberated. 
``There's nothing we can do about it,'' said Peckman, who estimated that her 
store's electricity bill has jumped about 20 percent this summer over last 
year's. Faced with the option of paying it or closing down, she added, 
``you're between a rock and a hard place.'' 
It has been four years since California became one of the first states to 
pass an energy deregulation law. Yet the movement to revamp the way power is 
sold in this country remains mired in a ``prolonged and muddled transition,'' 
according to a study published this month by Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates and the Arthur Andersen consulting firm. 
It's unclear when or even if that transition will ever be completed. In many 
parts of the country, public officials are terrified of plunging ahead with 
deregulation, given the high prices and other problems in California and New 
York. Some even harbor suspicions that California has led the nation astray 
by promoting an idea that is inherently flawed. 
California Public Utilities Commissioner Henry Duque said he encountered that 
attitude during a summer meeting of the National Association of Regulatory 
Utility Commissioners in Los Angeles. 
``I had other commissioners coming up to me saying, `What the hell is going 
on here,' '' Duque said. ``They were concerned. I think their thought was, 
did we in California see something that was wrong with deregulation but 
weren't going to level with them now that they had started down the path?'' 
Actually, the federal government bears much of the responsibility for 
initiating the drive to ease public control of electricity markets. 
Hoping to encourage new sources of electricity, Congress passed laws in 1978 
and 1992 that forced utility companies to buy increasing amounts of the power 
they use from other, unregulated energy suppliers. In 1996, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission also made it possible for other firms to ship 
their power over the high-voltage lines the utilities owned. 
Consumers were looking for a change, too. By the mid-1990s, the service 
provided by utility firms had become a sore subject. California had some of 
the highest utility rates in the country, and the electrical system's 
reliability was under fire. 
If only other companies could be lured into the market to compete, it was 
widely assumed, prices would plummet and overall customer satisfaction would 
improve. 
New York, New Hampshire and Rhode Island passed laws or made administrative 
rulings to deregulate slightly before California, where deregulation was 
approved in September 1996. 
Rhode Island and Massachusetts were first to give residents the ability to 
choose which company sold them their electricity. But because of its size and 
much publicized deliberations about its plan to deregulate during the 1990s, 
California was labeled the national leader on the issue. 
In many ways, however, deregulation in the state has been a flop -- at least, 
so far. 
Californians have had the right to pick their energy supplier since March 31, 
1998, when the electricity market was officially unfettered. That ability to 
choose was seen as an essential way to spur competition and, ultimately, 
lower energy prices. 
But as of Aug. 15, less than 2 percent of California's homeowners, businesses 
and others had seen fit to drop their local utility for some other supplier. 
By contrast, in Pennsylvania -- one of 13 other states that now let people 
choose -- 10 percent of customers have switched. 
Critics say that's a misleading comparison since Pennsylvania, unlike 
California, gives an energy price discount to consumers who make the switch. 
Nonetheless, Pennsylvania officials are clearly happy about how deregulation 
is working. 
A study in August by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge concluded that electricity 
competition will result in 36,400 new jobs and a $1.4 billion boost in 
personal income across the state by 2004. 
``We do not anticipate the problems in Pennsylvania that you have out there 
in California,'' said Kevin Cadden, a spokesman with that state's Public 
Utility Commission. ``I am not nervous at all.'' 
A study this summer by the non-profit Center for the Advancement of Energy 
Markets, which promotes deregulation, found that Pennsylvania has pushed 
electricity competition more effectively and quickly than any other state. 
Others listed in order in the top 10 were New York, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Texas, Nevada, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Connecticut. California 
was 16th. 
But consumers may have a different measure of success: whether their lights 
will stay on and how much electricity will cost them once government controls 
are removed. Unfortunately, in the two states where prices have been fully 
deregulated, the evidence is not encouraging. 
In San Diego, the first place in California to have its state-mandated cap on 
utility rates lifted under deregulation, electricity bills for many consumers 
this summer doubled, while power blackouts also rolled through Northern 
California. New York's experience wasn't quite as bad. But in the few 
counties there that were exposed to fully deregulated electricity rates this 
summer, the average residential bill rose 22 percent. 
Investigations are under way in California and New York to determine what 
happened. Nonetheless, the problems in both states have been largely blamed 
on an insufficient supply of power plants to meet their demand for 
electricity, which has forced consumers to pay just about whatever 
power-producing firms want to charge. 
``It's the piece that the economists missed'' when deregulation was touted 
several years ago, said Mike Donovan, a spokesman for Orange and Rockland 
Utilities, Inc., which supplies power to Susan Peckman's Pearl River liquor 
store, among other parts of New York. ``There isn't sufficient generation to 
really administer a full-scale competitive market.'' 
Ralph Cavanagh of the National Resources Defense Council in San Francisco 
maintains that deregulation has been unfairly maligned because the dearth of 
power plants has made it impossible for consumers to benefit from 
competition. Once that and some other problems are fixed, he said, ``I'm 
confident we'll have a more orderly market in the future.'' 
Others are growing nervous, however. This summer's difficulties have spurred 
calls to significantly stall or even reverse deregulation in North Carolina, 
Nevada, New Mexico, Minnesota, Oregon and Alabama, among other states. 
A Wisconsin consumer advocate recently chuckled over the phone as she read 
aloud a story about California's energy crisis, noting that such news made 
her opposition to deregulation much easier. 
``I am absolutely convinced that we are on an inexorable march toward the 
choice model,'' said Ken Malloy, president of the Center for the Advancement 
of Energy Markets. But he acknowledged that the experience in San Diego and 
New York ``is undeniably a bad thing that has happened to this movement, and 
it will set us back.''

2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.

3.	No incremental ""DASR'ing"":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)

4.	Cost allocation: the PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.

We are all saddened by yesterday's tragic events. This is likely to have 
personal ramifications for colleagues, friends, and families with close 
connections to the Haas School of Business and UC Berkeley.

Everyone is naturally eager to find out whether anyone from the extended 
Haas community has been affected. A website has been put up and is being 
used by many business schools to provide information in light of this 
national tragedy.  The address is http://www.finebrand.com/statuses. The 
site posts status reports of individuals by school and by class year. We 
encourage you to help update this information. Please note, however, that 
the School is not able, at this early stage, to confirm the accuracy of the 
information posted on this site.

Thank you for helping to alert the Haas community about those who may be in 
need of support. This is a sad time for our community and our nation.  As 
Associate Dean Ben Hermalin counseled us yesterday, we must recognize that 
many people will be severely affected by what has happened, and that they 
require our sympathy, understanding, and support.

611,"Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place.

We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero.  Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC.  AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality.

Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit (""market"" price) is now that there is no PX.  Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up""), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped ""adjusting"" the PX credit to recover past undercollections.  And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation.  Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run.

In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past.

I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne.  Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context.

612,"The CPUC is very aware that the utilities have gone to the legislature when 
the UDCs face elimination of some of the advantages that they have in the 
retail market.  We now have a fully-constituted commission (5 members) with 
two new democratic appointees with close ties to the governor.  This may 
empower the CPUC to take control of issues within their purvue, which 
ratemaking and the PX credit, clearly are.  Some members of the legislature 
are loathe to get into the CPUC's backyard and ""micro-manage"".  That being 
said, we still face significant risk within the legislature.  We have Steve 
Peace, who thinks a wholesale pass-through is adequate for competition, and 
Rod Wright, the chair of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee, who 
sponsored a similar bill last year and who doesn't believe in retail 
competition either.  We have our work cut out for us.

Last year we fought essentially the same battle and defeated the utilities at 
attempts to include similar provisions into law for electricity.  We were 
able to do so because we had a broad coalition of supporters, including the 
environmental community.  Essentially, everyone opposed the utilities' 
proposals.

This year we have a different scenario.  SCE is attempting to peel off 
environmental groups by rolling in extension of the public purpose funding.  
They are also talking to the large consumers, who may perceive that they are 
able to get a better deal from the utilities by avoiding the mark-up.

However, it doesn't appear as though the utilities are united in supporting 
SCE's language.  We are actively attempting to revive the coalition that was 
so effective last year.  We are talking to the environmental groups to try 
and keep them in the fold.  This can be done by keeping the two issues of 
public purpose funding and competition as separate as possible.  

We have been encouraged to settle the PX credit case by the judge.  We are 
engaged in the beginning stages of settlement on the PX credit issue with 
SDG&E.  We are a long way from settling, however, if we are successful, the 
settlement would likely be precedential for both SCE and PG&E.  There is 
significant room between the utility proposals for the ""retail"" portion of 
the PX credit and what we are supporting.  We also appear to have the support 
of the ratepayer advocates.  We are attempting to get the customer groups to 
agree on an outcome, leaving the utilities isolated.  Adoption of our 
proposal for the full retail adder is a long-shot.

From a timing perspective, it is possible that we will resolve this issue at 
the PUC, before any legislation would become effective.  However, that would 
not prevent the legislation from estopping the CPUC decision.

We could use the help of the business units in providing documented 
information about the UDCs activities, if its available.  Customer accounts 
are very credible, however most customers are unwilling to do that.  We may 
also need some assistance from the business units in presenting testimony 
when these issues go to hearing before the appropriate committees.

We are working on this issue and will report on any developments.  Thanks.

613,"I'm throwing out my thoughts on question 1 for the current case.

1.  Evaluate Patten's business strategy.

    My first thought centered around the fact that Patten's real expertise is
in real estate development.  They have a well thought out strategy of who the
customer is and how to sell effectively to these customers.  They have
developed a good business relationship with the large property owners.  With
little risk they analyze their ability to subdivide the properties.  Once
this is completed and the land purchased, they unleash their marketing
strategy.
    The marketing strategy seems to effectively gain sales without
extravegant costs.  The sales staff is custom designed to relate personally
to the average customer.  Their gross margin for land sales is 54.8%.  Even
if you include the selling, general and admin expense their margin is 24%.
    The part of their business strategy I struggle with is the finance
business.  What do a bunch of land developers know about finance.  In my
opinion land financing should be left to the experts.  If they established a
preferred financing company, they could negotiate a standard finders fee for
the loans.  More importantly they would eliminate the risk in their revenue
streams.  When they make a sale the revenue could be immediately booked since
they would not hold the debt, the finance company would.  Their current
portfolio of notes receivable is $18.6M.  It looks like ignoring expenses
their financing margin is 3%.  This only gives $0.56M in revenues.  This
number seems pretty small compared to the accounting heartburn it creates.
Obviously this number would be much smaller if they were properly estimating
unrecoverables.
    I guess the bottom line is ""what is their core competency""?  I believe
its land development not land finance.

Anyway give me your thoughts and I'll clean it up in a word document.

B2Bs Rose Hard and Fell Hard Once Before. Time for Act Two?
By Joe Bousquin 
Staff Reporter

URL: http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/1060952.html

Beware the booming B2Bs. 
Several business-to-business stocks rocketed upward Wednesday on little news 
as the Nasdaq waffled for most of the day. While some market watchers said 
investors were betting on a strong quarter, many analysts couldn't explain 
increases of 15% or more in stocks like Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq), Ventro 
(VNTR:Nasdaq), PurchasePro.com (PPRO:Nasdaq) and Clarus (CLRS:Nasdaq). 

Big Day for B2B
Several of the stocks rallied Wednesday on little news.


""You've got me,"" says Bill Epifanio, B2B analyst at J.P. Morgan. ""They're all 
going nuts on nothing."" 
Since earnings season ended, sentiment about B2B stocks has shifted back to 
the rose-colored variety in this sector. While this change is based on the 
concrete results that companies like Ariba (ARBA:Nasdaq), i2 Technologies 
(ITWO:Nasdaq) and FreeMarkets (FMKT:Nasdaq) delivered, investors also may 
want to pause and reflect. After all, it was only this past spring that 
investors grabbed any B2B stock within reach on hopes of unlimited growth, 
only to have them come crashing back down. 
Focus
""Before, we were buying stocks on promises of what they could be, and that's 
when it got out of hand,"" says Eric Upin, B2B analyst at Robertson Stephens. 
""Now, you've got to focus on which stocks are delivering lots of growth and 
revenue."" 
Upin looks to Ariba and i2 Technologies as examples of companies that are 
actually delivering. (He rates both a buy, and his firm hasn't done 
underwriting for either.) 
Ariba recorded $153 million in deferred revenue in the most recent quarter. 
Deferred revenue is money that a company collects before it actually delivers 
a product or does its job. It's a good signal, because if people are willing 
to pay before a company gives them something in return, it means there's 
strong demand. Ariba was up $8, or 6%, to $152.50. 
i2 is considered a strong player in supply-chain management software, and it 
has a partnership with Ariba and IBM (IBM:NYSE). It climbed $11.13, or 7%, to 
$168.75. 
Reaching?
But in a possible indication that investors may have just been reaching for 
any B2B stock, Ventro finished up $2.69, or 21%, at $15.50 on no news. This 
is the same company that upset analysts and investors with a poor 
second-quarter performance, with just $1.8 million in net revenue. ""Investors 
need to be more careful regarding which of the B2Bs they select,"" adds David 
Hilal, a B2B analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey. ""When B2B was at its 
highest, any company that used that acronym seemed to perform well. Now, you 
have to dig deeper and figure out which ones are the real players in this new 
economy."" 
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting subplots Wednesday involved Commerce 
One. On no real news -- there was talk about an already announced deal -- 
Commerce One shot up $10.88, or 21%, to $63.25. 
There's been a lot of chatter about the company lately. Gossips love to talk 
about how its partnership with German software maker SAP (SAP:NYSE ADR) might 
lead to a merger. Then there's the persistent rumor that the two companies 
will soon announce two more Internet exchanges for major industry groups. On 
top of that, Covisint, the big auto exchange that Commerce One is helping 
build, is setting up to launch near the end of September. 
Lump that in with the fact that Commerce One's stock has slouched in Ariba's 
shadow lately, add a dash of Wednesday's positive sector sentiment, and 
you've got the most active stock on the Nasdaq Wednesday. It traded more than 
27 million shares, whereas it usually trades 6.6 million. 
Ready to Bolt
Gavin Mlinar, an analyst at Sands Brothers, says the stock has been setting 
up for a move for a while. 
""September is a big month for them; they have so much on the table for a 
potential lift,"" Mlinar says. He's been crowing about Commerce One since 
mid-August, when he said the company was starting to look more attractive 
than Ariba on a valuation basis. 
And overall, Mlinar contends that conditions were right for a B2B run. 
""The emphasis and momentum has clearly been building lately,"" he says. ""There 
wasn't much, on a broad basis, since April, and now we're seeing a total 
rotation into these names."" 
Which is just what some observers are cautioning against. ","Joe Bousquin Ventro

629,"Greetings:
 
Recall that about 3 weeks we got a call from a CA PUC staffer asking whether 
we'd switched a particular gas customer (or two) back to the LDC.  We looked 
into it and discovered that we'd mistakenly switched the customer back due to 
a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two 
different utilities.  We informed the PUC staffer of the mix-up and explained 
that the situation would be resolved.  

The questions from the staffer arose because the CA PUC made a bad decision a 
couple of months ago. When gas prices ran up at the California border a lot 
of large (""noncore"") customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff 
in the hope of lowering gas costs.  In response, SoCalGas filed with the 
Commission asking the PUC to prohibit customers from switching back.  The 
Commission agreed and put the prohibition in place.  The Commission is now 
concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers (for 
whatever reason), or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire, 
customers won't have the option of returning to LDC service.

Today, I received a letter from the President of the Commission asking me to 
respond to the following:

Have you ""stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any non-core 
customers with whom you have an existing procurement contract, or...notified 
any of your non-core customers that you do not intend to renew an existing 
natural gas commodity procurement contract.  If your company has stopped or 
intends to stop serving non-core customers, the CPUC also needs to know

how many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminate
the natural gas volumes involved
the location of the non-core customer(s)
the reason(s) your company intends or has already acted to terminate those 
contracts.""

There's a good chance that the letter from the President of the Commission is 
linked to the fact that we've recently switched our electricity customers 
back to utility service in California.  

Prior to deciding whether and how to respond to the Commissioner, I'm trying 
to get handle on whether we're re-sourcing any gas retail customers to the 
utility prior to expiration, choosing not to renew contracts once they've 
expired, etc.  Catherine, or Jim Foster, can you help out?  Thanks.

As best we can tell, if the PUC suspends, it will suspend DA effective today, September 20th.
In addition, there is a considerable effort underway--from both ends of the spectrum--to persuade the PUC to reject 1) the proposed rate agreement between the PUC and DWR and 2) the proposed ""revenue requirement"" that DWR submitted to the PUC.

About 1 AM this morning, Burton closed down the Senate without voting out the Edison MOU.
Burton said there weren't the votes for it (which is true; there were about 6 votes for the MOU in the Senate), and he didn't want to ""embarrass"" Davis.
Burton said that there weren't the votes because the vote was a giveaway to big business, a corporate bailout, and a bad deal for consumers.
Davis responded by saying 1) the Assembly did a good job, 2) the Senate failed to do its job and 3) Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU.  The special session would begin in about 2 weeks.
Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldn't take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim.

A press account and Davis' statement are attached.

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION

Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed
to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win
approval in the California State Senate.

""I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the
business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness.
Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

""It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

""I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in
approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has
assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its
creditors will continue to show restraint.""

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility 
JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer
Saturday, September 15, 2001 
?2001 Associated Press 

URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2001/09/15/national0541EDT0485.DTL>

(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 

The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. 

As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. 

But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. 

""We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor,"" said President Pro Tem John Burton. ""It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation."" 

The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. 

Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. 

The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. 

""I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness,"" Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. ""Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done."" 

The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. 

The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. 

It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. 

While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. 

Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. 

The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. 

The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. 

""Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance,"" said Davis.

659,"Just talked to the PUC.  Seems that EES is up-to-date on its registration and it's only EEMC that's not current.  Wade will get the 1K to Jeanne Bennett, who's filled out the requisite one-pager and will send check and paperwork to where it needs to get.

HOWEVER, the PUC person notified us that they previously received notice from the issuer of EEMC's security bond that EEMC's security has been canceled.  She said that we have until day-after-Xmas to get current on the bond.  She could not reveal who the issuer is and I don't have that info. Presumably someone in EES received notice that the issuer was canceling EEMC's security bond?  We need to get info on that.

We should therefore also double check that the the issuer of the EES security bond hasn't also canceled.

Let me know if you have any questions,  and let me know what we find out about the bond, or if there's anything I can do to assist.

665,"Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:

One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

Sorry for the delay in updating you, but we've spent this past week working through credit-related issues in support of this transaction.  I've attached our most recent communication to Calpine, and we have begun discussions on which market regions can be supported under this transaction by Calpine's merchant portfolio.  We will be meeting with Calpine next Tuesday to discuss the size of the transaction and determine the positions and regions that best suit Enron & Calpine.  We will continue to push for PJM-E and Nepool components based on our earlier discussions, but I suspect FRCC volumes will end up being much less than listed in the term sheet below.  

Dana, currently EES has subscribed for the 50mw RTC energy listed in the term sheet below.  I will follow up with you today to see if you have any interest in expanding our Nepool subscription.

ENERGY-SAVING TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED IN PILOT PROGRAM - [Philadelphia Inquir=

735,"I would recommend the following assumptions for capacity resubscription fro=
m now through Q3 2006:

The historical average rates should be assumed for the resubscription of Ea=

 forward curves that have been discussed represent the value of capacity to=
 California, not East to East or Ignacio to Blanco capacity.  I don't think=
 that max rates for the capacity represented in these groups is appropriate=
.

The max rate at $.1020 is appropriate for the San Juan group.

The appropriate max rate for the West group is $.2868.

The volume of Ignacio to Blanco capacity available for resubscription shoul=
d be reduced.  Today, we have contracts from Ignacio to the Blanco Hub that=
 then continue on Transwestern on another contract.  (These contracts exist=
ed before Transwestern owned this line and were assigned to Transwestern wh=

ak"" in the contracts, Transwestern is collecting the San Juan lateral rate =
once on a contract from Ignacio to Blanco and then again on another contrac=
t from Blanco to Thoreau (or to the CA border).  In the future, when this c=
apacity is resubscribed, the contracts will most likely not be split at the=

Latest NFL Player News

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Mason caught eight passes for 107 yards and a TD against Green Bay. Right now, he is one of Fantasy Football's best wideouts in terms of consistency. 

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=12436&>, RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Hicks rushed for 142 yards and a TD as the Titans used him often to give a banged-up Eddie George some breathers. Expect to see more of Hicks from the Titans in the final weeks of the year, although George will remain the te! am! 's top RB option.

Antonio Freeman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
The Titans limited Freeman to 42 yards on two catches. If your team is moving on in the playoffs, however, you can expect better numbers from Freeman in the weeks ahead. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Green had an awful outing at Tennessee, finishing with just nine rushing yards and 24 receiving yards. Expect him to quickly rebound from such a poor performance. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/16/01
Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Banks' numbers were subpar against Philadelphia. He threw for 186 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in the game, and isn't reliable enough to be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Darrell Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.! sp! ortsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Jackson caught four passes for 85 yards against Dallas. He continues to be one of the most underrated and reliable receivers in the AFC. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 12/16/01
McNabb had a decent outing against Washington, throwing for 235 yards and two touchdowns. He did throw three interceptions as well, but McNabb will be a solid starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shaun Alexan! de! r <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=187382&> , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/16/01
Alexander carried seven times for 27 yards and a TD in relief of an injured Ricky Watters on Sunday. He saw limited action until Watters went down in the second half, and his playing time may continue to be sparse when Watters is healthy.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/16/01
Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12 carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries, but he's a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.




Quincy Carter! , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01Carter had a horrible game on Sunday, going 14-of-33 for 135 yards with an interception against Seattle. He has no value as a Fantasy player in any league.  <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=235201&>Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/16/01
Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this week on a sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit on Sunday. ""It's a small scope, not a big deal at all,"" Minnesota coach Dennis Green said. ""Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you never know."" Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was officially listed as inactive. 

Lamar Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 12/16/01
Smith carried nine times for only 22 yards at San Francisco. The Miami RB has been very inc! on! sistent in recent weeks, but he still may be good for a few TD runs during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Pinkston left Sunday's game against Washington in the fourth quarter with a shoulder injury. He did not return to the contest, and finished with two catches for 77 yards and a score. 

Jay Fiedler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 12/16/01
Fiedler threw for 149 yards, no TDs and was intercepted three times at San Francisco. The Miami QB is too erratic to be a regular starter for any Fantasy team during the playoffs.

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Watters left Sunday's game against Dallas in the fourth quarter with an injured right ankle. He was replaced by Shaun Alexander.

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 12/16/01
Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough ! pl! ayer to start during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/16/01
garcia left Sunday's game with sore ribs in the first half, then returned later. Tim Rattay played much of the second half in his place.

Scotty Anderson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=235015&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Anderson caught one pass for 69 yards against Minnesota. He will catch an occasional long ball, but Anderson is not producing enough to be useful for most Fantasy teams right now. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
McMahon threw for 241 yards and rushed for 74 yards and a TD against Minnesota. He will be a sevicable backup during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Cris Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 12/16/01
The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the veteran receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during any week of the Fantasy playoffs. 

M! ichael Bennett <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Bennett rushed for only 40 yards on 10 carries at Detroit. The rookie back is too inconsistent to rely on during the Fantasy postseason. 

Peerless Price <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Price caught four passes for 67 yards against New England. He appears to be Buffalo's most reliable Fantasy player at this time. 

Alex Van Pelt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
The Patriots limited Van Pelt to 219 passing yards, no TDs and one interception. Right now, the Buffalo QB is not playing well enough to start for any Fantasy team. 

Terry Glenn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 12/16/01
The Bills held Glenn to 27 yards on three catches. Glenn has missed too much time this year to regularly post good numbers for New England. 

Tom Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 12/16/01
Brady had another disappointing game, throwing for 237 yards, no TDs and an interception at Buffalo. All of a sudden, the New England QB appears to! b! e a Fantasy risk during the most important weeks of the year.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Rhodes rushed for 177 yards and two TDs against Atlanta. The Colts are out of the playoff hunt, yet Rhodes will keep many Fantasy teams in the running for a title. 

Peyton Manning <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=12531&>, QB IND - Neal/McKay Updated 12/16/01
Manning got back on track with 325 passing yards, three TDs and an interception against the Colts. He remains a must-start player in all Fantasy leagues.

Derrick Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 12/16/01
Alexander had four catches for 72 yards and a touchdown against Denver. He's been playing better in recent weeks, but Alexander is still a risky play outside of deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Martin caught seven passes for 84 yards and a TD at Indianapolis. Don't expect consistently good numbers from him during the Fantasy postseason.

NFL Reports, Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/19/01
Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Frank Updated 11/19/01
Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportslin! e.! com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day. 

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day. 

Quincy Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=235201&> , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason. 

James Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/19/01
Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fanta! sy! value might drop greatly.

Ryan Leaf <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football. 

Kevin Lockett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1765&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time. ! 
Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/19/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dalla! s ! faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day. 

Larry Foster <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.

Desmond Howard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1268&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day. 




Bert Emanuel! , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1186&>Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 11/18/01
Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10! t! imes for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/18/01
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.

Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..

David Sloan <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1331&>, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan! , ! who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1112&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.

David Terrell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Terrell caught o! ne! pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.

Marty Booker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=133228&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

Plaxico Burress <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=235249&>, RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/18/01
Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason. 

Hines Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/18/01
Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacks! on! ville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.

Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/18/01
Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble. 

Stacey Mack <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/18/01
Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.

Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/18/01
Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week.

756,"Good morning,

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,
Kam

Latest NFL Player News

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
McMahon, being groomed as Detroit's quarterback of the future, will make his first start for the winless Lions at Tampa Bay this week. He will replace Charlie Batch, who likely is out for the season after separating his right shoulder in Sunday's 13-10 loss at Chicago. Ty Detmer will back up McMahon, and a third quarterback will be added later in the week. McMahon does throw downfield with some success, and he is worth consideration as a Fantasy backup. 

Jets <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=20&>, DT NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
CB Aaron Glenn may miss up to four weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. His loss may mean the defense will blitz more often to protect the secondary, but the unit may also allow more passing yards in the next few games.

Jay Riemersma <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1662&>, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Riemersma suffered a concussion in Sunday night's game. His current status is day to day.

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/03/01
George aggravated an ankle injury on Sunday. He should be able to play at Minnesota next week.

Desmond Clark <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Clark suffered a strained groin in Sunday's game. His current status is day to day.

Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Kennison was signed by the Chiefs. Chris Thomas was released to make room for him on the roster. It is doubtful that Kennison will make much of an impact in Kansas City, even if he can work his way into the starting lineup.

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/h! tt! p://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Moore suffered a hip pointer injury Sunday and might miss Tampa's upcoming game. The Tampa Tribune reports that he is scheduled to undergo an MRI on Monday. Steve Yoder will start if Moore is unable to play. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
The Tennessean says X-rays were negative on McNair's left elbow. He is expected to play against the Vikings next week.

Fred Beasley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=15! 43! &key=12207&>, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Beasley suffered a stinger in Sunday's game. The San Francisco Chronicle reports that he is listed as probable for the upcoming game against the Rams. 

Mike Vanderjagt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12783&>, K IND - Hunter Updated 12/03/01
Vanderjagt suffered a pulled muscle in his back on Sunday. His statsu for the Dec. 10 game against the Dolphins is unclear.

Tony McGee <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1325&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
McGee will miss the rest of the sea! so! n with a sprained knee ligament. He may be replaced by Nick Williams or Brad St. Louis. Neither player has any apparent Fantasy potential.

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/03/01
Barlow missed Sunday's game because of an injured shoulder. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Shawn Bryson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=133240&>, RB BUF - Neal/McKay Updated 12/03/01
Bryson (ankle) was inactive for Sunday's game at San Francisco. His status for the team's next game is unclear.

Tywan Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=146523&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Mitchell will be the starting tight end now that Terry Hardy is out for the rest of the season. However, don't expect Mitchell to catch too many passes. He only has 14 receptions in 20 NFL games. 

Terry Hardy <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Hardy suffered a torn knee ligament Sunday and will miss the rest of the season. The Arizona Republic reports that Tywan Mitchell will be the starting tight end in his absence. 

Jeff Thomason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp! /e! link?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1333&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Thomason, suffering from a hyperextended knee, is not expected to practice Monday, according to The Philadelphia Daily Times. Thomason will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/03/01
Owens overcame a foot injury and played in Sunday's game. He caught six passes for 72 yards and touchdown. 

Tim Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Brown had a solid game, catching five passes for 63 yards and two scores against Arizona. With Jerry Rice on the other side of the field, Brown is having one of the best season of his illustrious career. 

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Gannon threw for 302 yards and three scores against Arizona. He did throw two picks as well, but he's still an elite Fantasy quarterback. 

David Boston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Boston had another great game, catching six passes for 1! 06! yards and a touchdown against Oakland. Boston continues to be one if the best wide receivers in Fantasy Football. 

Michael Pittman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 12/02/01
Pittman had a solid game, posting 93 all-purpose yards and a touchdown against Oakland. He's been inconsistent as a Fantasy player, however, and is best used when the matchup is right.

Tony Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Martin caught six passes for 97 yards against the Rams. The veteran wideout has seen better days, though, and he is not a reliable Fantasy wideout. He will occasionally post respectable numbers, but he will also have many quiet weeks.

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Christian rushed one time for five yards against St. Louis and caught four passes for 16 yards. He became a minor factor in the game as the Falcons fell behind early. Christian is still worth a reserve spot on any Fantasy roster.

Marshall Faulk <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 12/02/01
In addition to 70 rushing yards, Faulk caught six passes for 128 yards and three TDs. There seems to be no way of containing the best back in Fantasy Football. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/02/01
Warner bounced back from a forgettable Week 11 performance by tearing up the Falcons for 342 yards, four TDs and no interceptions. There should be little doubt that he is still capable of taking any Fantasy team to a championship this year.

Shaun Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/02/01
Alexander rushed for 87 yards and a TD against the Chargers. Defenses are stacking their fronts against Alexander, but he is still managing to score enough to be a must-start player for any Fantasy team.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Hasselbeck threw for 202 yards, no TDs and no interceptions against the Chargers. While he has certainly cut down on his mistakes, Hasselbeck doesn't challenge defenses downfield and he doesn't deserve a spot on most Fantasy rosters.

Curtis Conway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 12/02/01
C! on! way caught three passes for just 34 yards at Seattle. Still, he has remained healthy this year and should be a solid Fantasy wideout during these important final weeks.

Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/02/01
The Seahawks held Flutie to 195 passing yards, no TD passes and intercepted him twice. The veteran QB has been a disappointment for most of the year and he will not be a dependable Fantasy player in the final weeks of the season.

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Davis had only 53 yards rushing on 17 carries against Dallas on Sunday. He continues to have a mediocre season, which makes it tough for Fantasy owners to start him every week.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Keenan McCardell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01
McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.

Stacey Mack <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/25/01
Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk beca! us! e of his inconsistency. 

Qadry Ismail <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1514&>, WR BAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01
The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.

Jason Brookins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/25/01
Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.

Ron Dayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01
Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.

Tiki Barber <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01
Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&ra! nd! om=734&key=235249&>, RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/25/01
Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss. 

Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/25/01
Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage. 

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. 

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01
Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/25/01
Jackson had a ! go! od outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Joe Horn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 11/25/01
Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/25/01
In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.

Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/25/01
Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers

Tom Brady <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 11/25/01
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.

Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/25/01
Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.

Eric Moulds <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01
Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.

Alex Van Pelt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/25/01
Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.

Jay Fiedler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/25/01
Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/25/01
The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/25/01
Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too in! co! nsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch. 

Ki-Jana Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1089&>, RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.

Isaac Byrd <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1762&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/25/01
Muhammad missed S! un! day's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

Chris Chandler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

																							? ?  The price of natural gas established for November in Mexico is down  16% 
from October, having been set at $4.31 per MMBtu as against  October's price 
of $5.11 per MMBtu, according to the CRE. The  decrease is the largest 
monthly fall in the price of natural gas so  far this year and leaves the 
price at a level comparable to that of  six months ago, the CRE said.

deal number for the purchase?",,,Path
777,"Mary:

Is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow?  The large variance 
between confirmed and actuals began in June 2000 where 30 MMBtu was scheduled 
for Dix Ranch and zero for the Big Cowboy and Big Cowboy #2 wells.  It 
appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at Despain where 
985,350 MMBtu was confirmed.  This well has never flowed this much volume, 
and in June 2000 it flowed approximately 320,000 MMBtu.  Do we actually have 
support (i.e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet) for the 985,350 
MMBtu that was entered into MOPS as confirmed?  This trend of ""nothing"" being 
confirmed at these three wells continued until July 2000.  In August 2000 
this scenario changed and 612,388 was confirmed at Dix Ranch and nothing was 
scheduled at the Big Cowboy and Big Cowboy #2 wells.

From reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at 
these wells that we expected.  If the issue is an actual increase in the 
volumes flowing at these wells, I would suggest that you call our Gas 
Measurement department and ask them to audit Coral's charts. Coral may be is 
calculating the volumes incorrectly.

This could also be an allocations issue.  The allocation as it is in the 
System today closely agrees with the allocation statement that I receive 
monthly from Karen Lambert at Tejas.  The only differences between the Tejas 
schedule and what is in MOPS are the Acock production and Gain or Loss which 
are not scheduled and therefore not allocated.  I know that you are working 
on the Acock production and Tom Acton and I are working on the Gain/Loss.  
Tom will tell me how to path the gas so that I can set up accounting 
arrangements for April 1999 forward.  Scheduling will have analyze and 
possibly rework January through March 1999 because these months were 
originally set up in POPS.

I want to help, so if I have missed the issue(s) would you please clarify it 
or them for me and let me know if I need to do anything for you.  

Thanks,

a is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants=
 consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks w=

 Torry Holt , WR STL - Terminators Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential =
to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a b=

asis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Mud Dogz Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been =
very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benchi=

s become a decent tight end from a Fantasy ! pe! rspective this season. He'=
s worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight e=

Canidate will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back thi=
s weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offen=

t Warner , QB STL - Sack Attack Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbe=

n is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. =

In response to feedback received from Enron traders worldwide, we have 
upgraded and improved the Stack Manager to include new functionality which we 
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your 
products.

This new release will be automatically installed within the next few days. 
Please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade.

Summary of New Features

Multiple Children - A ""Child"" product can be the ""Parent"" of another Child 
(multiple links in a chain) and different types of links can be placed 
against a single Parent.

Static Product Bar Prices - When you change a price in the Product Bar and 
hit the ""+"" or ""-"" button, the price stays - it does not reset to the amount 
in Product Properties until you logout.

Sorting - You can sort by any field on the Products Tab simply by clicking on 
the title of the field. For multiple sorts, hold down your ""shift"" key.

Parent Products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis 
relationship identified. (e.g. The Product bar might before have said: ""Basis 
Link - Parent"" and now would say ""Stand Alone, Parent"").


Detailed Feature Descriptions


Multiple Children

The new version of EnronOnline allows you to link several products together 
in a long chain. For example, Child Product A can be linked to Parent Product 
B, which is in turn linked to Parent Product C.

Warning: Although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a 
chain, system performance is degraded by large chains. This is because when a 
customer attempts a transaction, the database must ""lock"" each and every 
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request. The 
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the 
locks. ""Vertical"" chains (multiple parents and children in one long link) are 
much slower to process than ""Flat"" chains (One parent with many children). 
Large vertical chains should be avoided. 

Related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the 
same parent. For example, Child Product A can have a Basis link to Parent 
Product B. At the same time, Child Product C can have a Syncopated Basis link 
to the same Parent Product B. Parent B is the parent for both a Syncopated 
Basis link and a regular Basis Link.


Static Product Bar Prices

The new version of EnronOnline provides for ""sticky"" Product Bar price and 
volume changes. When you change a number on the Product Bar, it does not 
reset to the number contained in the Product Properties menu until after you 
have logged out. This makes it easier to update prices, volumes, spreads or 
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the ""+"" or ""-"" buttons. 

One of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it 
reduces repeated price movements. With the old version of Stack Manager, if 
the price delta was too small, traders would often repeatedly hit the price 
movement buttons. Each of these price changes must be communicated across the 
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth. This makes it harder 
for customers to transact with us - each time they try, a new price update 
moves the price, resulting in an increased transaction failure rate. Entering 
an appropriate price into the Price Delta field and then pressing the price 
movement button means that fewer (but larger) price movements are necessary, 
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure 
rate.

You may also notice a new addition to the Product Bar prices - a new field 
for Offset to Last Trade. This allows you to update the offset for Products 
which have Offset to Last Trade selected from the Product Properties Menu.


Sorting/Selecting

The new version of EnronOnline provide significant additional sorting 
functionality over the old. You can now choose any field heading (Type, 
Location, Reference Period,  etc.) and sort by that item. You can do multiple 
sorts by holding down the shift key. Example: If you select Type and then 
Location while holding the shift key, you will see your products sorted first 
by Product Type and then within each Product Type, by Location (in 
alphabetical order).

If you right click on the Product menu, you can choose from the same sort 
criteria, plus you can select ""Sort by Web Order"", which allows you to see 
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the 
website (note however, that a customer on the website might be also seeing a 
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing).

When you select products, you can drag your mouse while holding down the left 
mouse button as always, but now you can also hold down the <ctrl> key while 
making your selections. This allows you to highlight products which are not 
necessarily adjacent to one another.


Parent Products and F/X Products

One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its 
treatment of how parent products are displayed. The old version showed the 
type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar (to the left of 
the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs). The new version 
does not show the type of link. This is because the new version allows for 
more than one type of link on each parent product.

Some traders may notice that  their  products which have f/x links are now 
identified with a stylised ""fx"" in the Product list. This is to enable easy 
identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the 
parent, rather than managed individually.

General Feedback

If you have any comments on the new functionality, or suggestions for further 
functionality, please call David Forster on 713 853 1861. If you had 
previously suggested new functionality which didn't make it into this 
release, rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard 
to improve all elements of EnronOnline and will try to incorporate your 
requests into the next release of the EnronOnline Stack Manager.

this move is complete, there should be no active deals remaining on the CES

there were no transport usage tickets booked on the CES desk.  This is not 
true; however transport usage tickets will be included in the change over; 
therefore this will not be a problem.  On the East desk, three desk to desk

402-398-7449.  Note the issue raised by the email from Rick Dietz. Thanks.  DF
",Rick Dietz,,
820,"I got a call from Tino Monaldo today passing on the results of Dennis 
Langley's meeting with DOE in Albuquerque.  DOE indicated that their current 
PNM rate is ""5.3 cents, exclusive of the demand charge.""  Tino's consultant 
claims that factoring in the demand charge yields an effective rate of 
approximately 7 cents/KWh.  Assuming we need to come in at 10% less than the 
current rate, our bogey is 6.3 cents/KWh.  This is at the high end of the 
range we hoped they'd be in.

Additionally, DOE indicated that they need ""redundancy"" and don't want to 
rely on PNM for back up power.  They want a multiple turbine facility--i.e., 
more smaller turbines instead of fewer large turbines.  The new pipeline will 
need to be split connected to El Paso and TW in order to access diverse 
supplies and guard against supply failure.  They have not asked for fuel oil 
backup.  

I know this is starting to look like the project that won't go away, but the 
power price number looks very promising to me.  I think its worth scrubbing 
down the model we've used to replace the generic capital cost and O&M 
assumptions with more specific assumptions related to the specific turbine 
configuration we'd be using.  

If this price is really as favorable as I think, can we make another run at 
the ENA people and Federal Solutions guys to see if they have any interest?

mention that Texas has a statute that prohibits demanding or selling at an

declared a disaster, which I assumed didn't fit our scenario.  I didn't see 
anything in the Texas case law but it was a quick look.",Susan,,
822,"Mike, here are two draft sets of talking points covering Stan's initial phone 
call with Ted Davis to discuss whether a settlement meeting would be useful 
and the subsequent settlement meeting itself.  Please give me any comments 
you have and I'll send to Stan or have available to hand to him at our 
meeting, which I understand is scheduled for 9 am on Tuesday.  I'll  be 
calling in from Arizona.  Note there is at least one issue we ought to think 
about a bit more--whether to have Stan imply there may be other goodies 
available other than the Hobbs Line.  I'm inclined to avoid implying that, 
but to have Stan primed to pull out additional goodies if necessary.

I have not yet completed a bullet point outline of the settlement proposal 
for Stan to send to Davis after Stan and he meet.  As things currently stand 
it would basically be identical to the second sheet of talking points.   I 
would prefer to finalize that document after we meet with Stan, both to 
minimize the paper in front of him at the Tuesday meeting and to allow the 
Davis outline to be tailored to reflect the strategy we arrive at with Stan 
(I think I'm safe in assuming we will tinker with the strategy a bit on 
Tuesday morning).  If we do modify the strategy, I'll also modify the talking 
points.  

Britt and Barrett, I wanted you to know the timetable in part because, if 
Stan decides to go forward,  we need to send Barrett's suggested letter to 
Jad verifying continued application of the settlement privilege to Stan and 
Ted's discussions.   I intend to call you after the Stan meeting to advise.  
Just in case you don't hear from me by late morning Tuesday, please give Mike 
a call to confirm whether to send the letter.  I may have fallen into the 
Grand Canyon or been bitten by a hila monster.

  Drew J. Fossum
  Counsel
  Enron Corp.

Dear  Mr. Fossum:

I would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to LRSolutions.  It is 
our mission to provide corporate in-house counsel with all the tools and 
resources necessary to excel in every area of legal practice - preventative 
law, new product development and new markets, litigation support, 
transactional work, and regulatory compliance, among others.  At LRSolutions, 
we are able to meet this challenge through the provision of expert legal 
knowledge at reasonable, fixed prices.

As you are well aware, legal research and related ""knowledge"" activities and 
products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise.  
(if you would like to see our website it is http://www.lrsolutions.com.  
Click on any of the links on the lefthand side of the screen for detailed 
descriptions).  Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of 
""reinventing the wheel"", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.  
Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing 
inexperienced, junior associates.  The subsequent learning curve only adds to 
the enormous costs for corporate counsel.

However, LRSolutions is structured to maximize efficiency, value and 
quality.  Our network of legal experts includes hundreds of the nation's 
premier law professors and other distinguished attorneys organized 
intuitively into areas of specialty.  Please see 
http://www.lrsolutions.com/network.html.  In addition, our Board of Advisers 
includes the former Chief Counsel for Cigna Corporation, the former Associate 
General Counsel from Proctor and Gamble, and a partner from a large 
Washington D.C. law firm.

Experienced, partner-level attorneys actively manage all research -related 
projects, and are always available to discuss your concerns.  Our products 
and formats are flexible, and include multi-state surveys, detailed research 
memoranda on specific, complex issues, summations of law, advocacy materials 
such as appellate briefs and court filings, and listings of relevant 
authorities.  We will always work with you to determine the format and 
objective that best suits your needs.  Please see 
http://www.lrsolutions.com/expert.html.

We also are in the early stages of developing essential online compliance 
education training for corporate employees.  As you know, compliance training 
is essential if corporations are to avoid damaging liability.  Please see 
http://www.lrsolutions.com/online.html.  Federal sentencing guidelines and 
courts often reduce or eliminate liabiity for companies with effective 
programs.  We are looking for corporations that are interested in forming 
strategic alliances with LRSolutions regarding production of these courses.  
Please see http://www.lrsolutions.com/strategic.html.

I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting at your corporate 
headquarters to discuss LRSolutions further.  If you would like to contact me 
by phone, or would like to receive a brochure, please feel free to call at 
1-800-627-8047.  Please also feel free to reply via email as well.  I am 
convinced that LRSolutions will be a critical and welcome long-term resource 
for your legal department and greatly look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely Yours

833,"Back by popular demand, here are the current travel alternatives to Shadow 
Ridge C.C., the site of this year's NPNG Holiday Party:


Pacific Street  

There are currently no road projects that would block access to the club's 
main enterance at 187th - this is the recommended route.
    
The work that had Pacific out of commission from 190th to 204th has been 
completed.  However, the intersection at 204th is still somewhat a mess - no 
street lights, no traffic lights, unmarked roads, no street signs, etc.  
Also, Pacific is now closed west of 204th.

Center Street  

Center Street is open.  However, you currently cannot directly access 180th 
Street (North or South) from Center or cross Center on 180th.  

There is an unmarked detour that can get you to from Center to 180th around 
the Lakeside Complex and through the Western Springs subdivision.  But it 
would be difficult to explain on paper how to do it.

You can turn on to 192nd from Center (the Lanoha corner), go North on 192nd 
to Pacific and go East to 187th to get to the club.  But be careful if you 
take this route to go from the club back to Center - turning from 192nd on to 
Center going East can be a problem at times (cars on Center do travel at 
fairly high speeds and they do not expect people to be coming on to Center at 
this location at this time of night).  Watch out for wildlife in this area as 
well.
    
West Dodge Road

Dodge is a mess from 160th to 180th Street.  There are some lane changes in 
this area that can be hard to navigate when it is dark.  Also, there is no 
way to gain access to 168th from Dodge or cross Dodge at 168th.

If you feel up to handling the construction, you can get off of Dodge at 
180th Street.  But be sure to recognize that 180th is an abnormal 
intersection - it is like an interchange without an overpass (going west, 
you'll need to take an unmarked exit lane that goes off to the right at about 
179th, turn on to 180th, and cross Dodge at  the intersection - left turns 
directly off of Dodge are not permitted).

Also, be aware that there is an unmarked deer crossing area that goes from 
about 180th to 186th Street on Dodge and a few blocks South of Dodge at 180th 
- there is a creek that serves as crossing point for such wildlife.  I have 
seen a number of cars that have hit deer in this area.


Bottom line, taking Pacific is the best route.

non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we ""share"" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

NOTICE: COH OFO/OMO

Date Issued: December 11, 2000 

As a result of returning cold weather and significant under-deliveries by 
shippers on the Columbia Gas of Ohio (COH) system, COH is calling an 
Operational Flow Order and an Operational Matching Order (OMO) for all COH 
Gas Transportation Customers. The OFO/OMO is effective on gas day December 
13, 2000 and will remain in effect until further notice. If conditions 
warrant, these orders will be lifted to reflect the changing conditions and 
COH will advise you of such changes. Customer and marketer banks are not 
available during the OFO/OMO period. 

This notice is applicable to the Customer Choice program. CHOICE deliveries 
should always equal the customers demand curve. The OFO requires the same 
level of delivery, but the tariff provides for additional costs for failure 
to comply.

Customers with daily measurement devices are subject to the OMO. Those 
customers or their shippers are directed to adjust the customer's consumption 
and/or their deliveries to COH so that their deliveries to COH are equal to 
the customer's actual consumption.

Customers without daily measurement devices are subject to the OFO. Those 
customers are hereby directed to adjust their daily scheduled deliveries to 
COH so that those deliveries are equal to 60% of the customer's maximum daily 
volume as specified in the customer's gas transportation contract with COH.

Those customers or their shippers who fail to comply with this OFO/OMO shall 
be subject to penalties for the difference as provided for in COH's tariff. 
COH will continue to monitor weather conditions and demand, in order to 
remove the OFO/OMO as soon as possible.

If you have questions regarding this notice, please contact your Columbia Gas 
Representative.

1.  Cove Point LNG is a peaking facility.  There are three 10-day peaking
contracts for 50,000 Dthd each or a total of 150,000 Dthd of peaking 
capability
by delivery from the Cove Point pipeline into the east side of TCO's system.
The gas can also go directly into Washington Gas Light or into PEPCO's Chalk
Point electric generation facility.  The variable transport cost on Cove Point
LNG is less than $0.005/Dth.  This gas was hedged by CES as baseload 
withdrawal
during the January 1999, but can be withdrawn any time before the end of the
contracts which is 2/29/2000.

2.  The TCO storage is the CES retail storage.  Enron's contract with CES
retail contains the withdrawal schedule for this storage.  I would work with 
Ed

868,"Steve, I talked to Cindy Burnette about SIT Penalties in February on Monday, 
3/13/2000. Unfortunately Joann and I thought the SIT withdrawal Penalty was 
lifted on 2/3/2000 and reinstated on 2/17/2000. We did not realize that TCO 
lifted the penalty for only one day on 2/3/2000 and reinstated it on 
2/4/2000. TCO lifted it again on 2/15/2000 and reinstated it on 2/17/2000. 
Joann and I missed the period from 2/4/2000 to 2/14/2000.

In early February, Cindy talked to Joann and I about matching the burns to 
the best reading around noon of the gas day that just ended. Because TCO 
allows it shippers to  use SIT, our goal is try to match the burn to about 
500 dkt difference. There are some days we will go a little longer and some 
days we will go a little shorter. Our February 2000 monthly goal was to hit 
close to zero. I'm attaching a spreadsheet that shows Enron's net SIT for 
February was +288. Joann and I also realize that when SIT withdrawal is not 
allowed, that we need to send extra gas to the burn and then back off the gas 
once the actuals are received. 

The attached spreadsheet shows that on days 2/4/2000 to 2/6/2000 that Enron 
had 17,753 Broadrun gas going into Enron's IPP pool. Each day the SIT 
withdrawal was less than 500 dkt. On day 2/9/2000, we did adjust the actuals 
to meet the burn and Joann sent the print screens to Cindy on 3/10/2000 for 
proof to waive the penalties. On gas days 2/11/2000 to 2/14/2000, we were 
short less than 500 dkt and we had 5684 broadrun gas going to the pool. On 
2/18, we did adjust the actuals to meet the burn and sent the screen prints 
to Judy on 3/6/2000 for proof to waive the penalties for that day.

Joann and I are very competent and experienced schedulers and were not trying 
to game TCO's system by abusing the SIT withdrawals. We just didn't realize 
that TCO had reinstated the penalties for SIT withdrawal for 2/4/2000 to 
2/14/2000. The way TCO posts on the bulletin board, it is not always clear to 
the shippers when penalties situations are lifted and reinstated.

My other concern was how this penalty was communicated to us. Julie called me 
on 3/6/2000, and said that Judy wanted Julie to send to me the 8 series 
report. I told Julie I had no idea what she was talking about, but go ahead 
and send the report. When I received the report, it was the report we had 
used for overrun charges. We did not occur overrun changes, so I was not 
concerned with the report. Then Cindy called me about an hour later on 
3/6/2000 to tell me we had Hopewell penalties. I told Cindy I didn't 
understand what penalties we had incurred, since there were no overrun 
charges. She said we had SIT withdrawal penalties. Joann and I looked at days 
1, 2, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We faxed over the proof to TCO for day 18, that 
we had matched the burns to the readings available at noon that day. Joann 
specifically asked Judy if this was the only penalty we had, and Judy was not 
100 % sure but thought so. 

There were no further conversations between TCO Team 3 and Enron about the 
SIT withdrawal penalties, until Cindy called Joann on 3/10 around 4:30 pm to 
tell Joann we had incurred several days of penalties. Joann asked Cindy which 
days, since we had already fixed the days we knew about SIT withdrawal 
penalties. Cindy told Joann about days 4,5,6,9,11,12,13, and 14. Joann faxed 
the proof for day 2/9/2000. Joann asked Cindy if she could do the retro's for 
the other days because we had plenty of Broadrun gas going to our pool. Cindy 
told Joann that she would have to run it past Steve, to waive the other days 
penalties.

TCO's philosophy has been vary accommodating to its shippers in the past. 
Judy had always told Joann and I, if CES/Enron made a good faith effort to 
keep SIT to a minimum, the penalties will not be charged. Enron feels it made 
a good faith effort to minimize SIT withdrawals in February 2000, and would 
like the SIT withdrawal penalties to be waived.

In addition, Enron has a win/win request for our Customer ServiceTeam. TCO's 
penalty philosophy appears to be changing and will not be as accommodating as 
it was in the past. Enron would like our Customer Service Team's assistance 
during the month to identify potential penalty situations. This will 
alleviate disagreements between TCO and Enron at the end of the month.

Before I send the this to Jeanne Adkins and Tom Brasselle, I'm running this 
past y'all. 

Thanks for your assistance and understanding Enron's point of view.

877,Sorry about that.  Gotta go to a meeting.  Give Muffy a hug for me.,Muffy,,
878,"My only suggestion are as follows:
(1)  We need to be more explicit about the de-coupling of the assets from the 
gas that is delivered to CES by ENA.  As such, I would recommend that we 
expand Sections 4.1 and 4.2  to include a CES paper pool storage or bank 
which gets credits (theoretical injections) and debits (theoretical 
withdrawals).  The credits to the bank would be made in accordance with the 
""Theoretical Storage Injection Schedule (TSIS)"" as per 4.2 and Exhibit 2.  
The debits to the bank would be made per the daily CES nominations on days 
when the retail demand is greater than the daily purchase quantity defined on 
Exhibit 1.  The one exception to this de-coupling is that all of the 
debits/credits would be subject to operational constraints imposed by the Gas 
Storage Contracts and the Gas Transportation Contracts.  The constraints 
should only come into play with the debits, as the TSIS (which by definition 
will be less than the daily MDIQ) would rarely be impacted by constraints.  
At the end of the term, the bank balance and the physical storage balance 
will need to be equal.  If not, provision needs to be made for a post term 
true-up.

(2)  In the last sentence of Section 4.1, should the remedy for CES's failure 
to notify in a timely manner be ""penalties"" or ""ENA damages,"" which would 
include both penalties and trading losses &/or opportunity costs?  I am not 
certain, but I understood it to be the latter.

I know you are all being forwarded the messages on the blood drive and the contribution matching by Enron (2 for 1) to charitable organizations in NY.  I know we ask a lot of our employees and sometimes all these ""contributions"" seem overwhelming.  I personally ask each of you to take time this week in your own personal way to give thanks.  We have group members who were close to harms way and the Central Region has family members potentially lost in this tragedy.  

The best way I know to encourage an official ""time-out""  is to ensure you all start your weekends with your families starting at noon today.  Officially Central Origination/enovate are closed this afternoon.

As we discussed today, the following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) 
project status:

?  TRV is targeted to be implemented by May 15th as scheduled.
?  TRV development and security setup has been completed and is ready to be 
presented to the traders. 
?  Hal and I will meet with Phillip and Kam tomorrow to provide the TRV 
system and administrator rights review, and to publish  their region's 
reports.
?  We will then meet with Darron, David, and Errol (to be scheduled for early 
next week) to provide the TRV system and  administrator rights review, and to 
publish their region's reports.
?   At the conclusion of the review, we will determine we will roll out the 
training for the remaining team members within each  region (i.e. Region 
Leads or IT to provide training to the team members).
?  Currently TRV is running in the development environment for the review 
period.  Upon conclusion of the review period, we will  ask for approval and 
UAT signoff from you in order to transition the system into the Production 
environment.

Again, thank you and each of your team members for everyone's help and 
support on this initiative!  Please let me know if you have any questions.

957,"Hey Mark
below is a summary of the costs I paid for Bill's funeral and credit card
costs.

Mariachis             260
Price Club            370
Arturo food           240
chair rental              80

Household CC   600     paid in November
Household  CC   146    paid Dec. 26th
Mervyns bill        1420    total of January statement
Macy's bill           1050    total of January statement
Total                    $4,166

I'll go ahead and pay the Mervyns and Macy's bill as soon as I receive your
check and since I just got their statements.   I'd like to avoid paying
them 18% interest as long as you have the cash.     I have not received a
bill from the funeral home, nor have I paid them anything.   I can't
remember if you gave them my address or your mom's.

FYI,  I've received two voice mails from bill collectors regarding Cito's
old Broadway credit card (I think they are now Bloomingdale's).     I have
not replied to their voice mails and do not know how they received my phone
number.   But I'll ignore them for now since they are trying to hunt down
Salvador Guzman, who died 18 years ago anyway.     They will probably give
up trying to collect, but just thought I'd let you know about that pending
liability.    Do you know how much Bill owed them?

In case you don't have my address, it is
     7971 Southwind Circle
     HB   92648

see ya,

I have purchased 8 mws from the service desk for Tuesday (04/10) in SP-15.  
We bought 8 mws from a service customer through the APX.  I have made the 
entries into CAPs for the purchase from APX.  I have inc'd load in ST-WBOM.  
Load will need to be dec'd and the energy sold off. You may want to  combine 
it with EES(or buy some mws to make it a whole piece to sell) and use NCPA to 
move it North.  Or maybe export it at Silverpeak.  The schedule is as 
follows.  8 mw, HE 1-24 on 04/10 in SP-15.  The price is $150 peak, and $100 
off peak.  Purchase from Services is #574640, and purchase from APX is 
#574629.  Please make any buy-resales and sales under ST-WBOM. 
Please call with any questions.

Add at the end of item 2: Investment terms and pricing;  Financing terms and 
pricing:

As indicated in the DASH, the $44.6MM represents the total amount requested 
for expenditures on project soft costs, as defined by accounting.  None of 
these dollars may be expended for hard costs, as defined by accounting, 
thereby preserving the ability to finance the power plant off balance sheet.  
Any additional project expenditures (including commitments) which may be 
requested through another DASH (for turbine payments as mentioned in this 
DASH or any new amounts) must be incurred by a financing vehicle/structure 
which will allow this power project to be financed off Enron's balance sheet.

follows:

Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings, 
it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance.  However, provided there 
are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized 
drafts in advance of filing.
RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not 
involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues.

1007,"Mary,  I looked into your idea regarding using an index price approach along 
the lines of the tariff that was approved for EPMI's market based sales to 
PGE in Docket No. ER99-364-000.  I agree that the current situation is quite 
similar to that.  thus, since the current proposal is similar to one that has 
already been accepted, the matter is less controversial than I originally 
thought and I do not think that this would entail much additional research.  
Nor do I think that we necessarily need to pre-screen this with FERC since 
that would delay the filing.  I would therefore revise my RCR projection to 
$5,000 to prepare the filing and suggest that we simply file it.  (I would 
let you know if I think it is more complicated once I dig in.)

FYI, I ran this through Dan, and he agrees with the foregoing.  As before, 
however, we cannot get FERC approval within the time frame contemplated by 
the RFP.  I agree with you that the conservative and preferable (from a 
legal/regulatory perspective) way to proceed is to make your proposal to PGE 
subject to FERC approval.  Since time is of the essence, let me know when to 
begin, and we'll jump on it right away.  Ron

1011,"Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and 
therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego 
has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the ""California"" 
markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of 
costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential 
refund obligations.  It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are 
being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.

I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:

In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had 
ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had 
not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its 
customers.  To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required 
would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has 
merely conditioned its rates ""subject to refund.""  Accordingly, it is 
inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits.
San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market, 
although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of 
insolvency.  It has simply said that ""there is no assurance that the actual 
wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially 
may be ordered.""
San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense.  This 
allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability 
calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated.  
This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the 
Commission March 9 order. 
The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given 
that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in 
the market for years - ""pending a final nonappealable order in these 
proceedings.""  Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15 
order finding that it would not order cost based rates.
This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to 
FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of 
wholesale power ""in the California markets"" not just for sales in the ISO and 
PX markets.",,$69 million,"FERC Columbia Gas Systems Inc. Columbia EPMI the

In October we had a plan to purchase 0.5 Bcf of gas that was projected to bring our operational storage level to 12 Bcf by the end of the month and were concerned about over-filling our storage fields from potential long gas by shippers.  In reality, prices have risen and shippers have shorted the system by 1.7 Bcf month-to-date.  Our original plan, based on a combination of physical requirements and regulatory strategy was as follows:

Ending October Balance		12 Bcf
Ending November Balance		13 Bcf
Ending December Balance		14 Bcf

To acheive this plan we are projecting a purchase in November of at least 2.5 Bcf (depending upon shipper short gas over the remainder of the month).  We also expect to receive 0.3 Bcf of SBA imbalance payback in November that should raise the operational storage levels to approximately 13 Bcf.  We are still at risk for over-filling our storage fields in November and do not wish to buy any volumes that might push us over the 13 Bcf operational storage level.  Therefore, we are targeting the purchase of 2.5 Bcf of gas (which may be adjusted based on the customer's imbalances over the next week) for November.

This is the latest from AA on what they want to see in an internal and external legal letter on Dabhol.  They now say they need both letters the earlier of 1) when they sign off on the 3rd Qtr 10-Q or 2) December 15, 2001.  Give me a call and we can discuss further.

FYI -

Bechtel has requested that the agenda for the DPC board meeting next week include a vote to issue the Phase II shares.  Once the shares are issued, Enron will have 65% voting rights and will be able to control the matters which require majority consents (the memo attached below contains a summary of such matters).

Mary Cilia and I had worked with Mike Jones (AA) on this a few months ago and he had agreed that we could avoid consolidation of DPC by entering into a legally binding side letter with GE and Bechtel waiving our majority consent rights and agreeing to vote as a block with them on such matters.  AA's concurrence is subject to their review the side letter and confirmation that it is legally binding.

Jeff Sommers and I are scheduling a meeting with Mike Jones for tomorrow to ensure that the previously reached conclusion still stands.

1049,"Once upon a time there lived a king. 
The king had a beautiful daughter, 
the princess. 

But there was a problem. 
Everything the princess touched would melt. 
No matter what; 
metal, 
wood, 
plastic 
anything she touched would melt. 

Because of this, men were afraid of her. 
Nobody would dare marry her. 

The king despaired. 
What could he do to help his daughter? 

He consulted his wizards and magicians. 
One wizard told the king, 

""If your daughter touches one thing 
that does not melt in her hands, 
she will be cured."" 

The king was overjoyed. 

The next day, 
he held a competition. 
Any man that could bring his daughter an 
object that would not melt would marry her 
and inherit the king's wealth. 

Three young princes took up the challenge. 

The first prince brought a very hard alloy of titanium. 
But alas, 
once the princess touched it, 
it melted. 
The prince went away sadly. 

The second prince brought a huge diamond, 
thinking that diamond is the hardest substance 
in the world and would not melt. 
But alas, 
once the princess touched it, 
it melted. 
He too was sent away disappointed. 

The third prince approached. 
He told the princess, 
""Put your hand in my pocket and feel what 
is in there."" 
The princess did as she was told, 
though she turned red. 
She felt something hard. 
She held it in her hand. 
And it did not melt!!! 

The king was overjoyed. 
Everybody in the kingdom was overjoyed. 
And the third prince married the princess 
and they both lived happily ever after. 


Question: 

What was the object in the prince's pants? 


(Scroll down for the answer) 

?

? 

They were M&M's of course. 
They melt in your mouth, not in your hand.

	Many believe the potato chip was born in 1853 in a restaurant in Saratoga 
Springs, N.Y. when a picky customer complained about the thickness of his 
fried potatoes. When the potatoes were returned to wise guy cook, George Crum 
he sliced some potatoes as thinly as possible, fried them and sent them back 
to the customer. To his surprise the man loved them. For more, click here.

	The Long Hack Veil
	Jennifer visited a psychic of some local repute. 
	
	In a dark and hazy room, peering into a crystal ball, the mystic delivered 
grave news: 
	
	""There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just be blunt - prepare yourself to 
be a widow. Your husband will die a violent and horrible death this year."" 
	
	Visibly shaken, Jennifer stared at the woman's lined face, then at the single 
flickering candle, then down at her hands. She took a few deep breaths to 
compose herself. 
	
	She simply had to know. She met the fortune teller's gaze, steadied her 
voice, and asked: 
	
	""Will I be acquitted?""

	Remember the Magic 8 Ball from your youth? Well, in keeping with the 
tradition of the rest of our lives being digitized in Web-chunks, you can now 
have a Magic 8 Ball shaken just for you on the Web. That's right - ask it a 
question and the 8 Ball shakes itself up and reflects an answer to you via a 
Webcam. The use of the Webcam and a bunch of other techno-babble is explained 
in excrutiating detail at the site but will make your head explode if you try 
and read it. Trust me - just stick to the questions. 8ball.federated.com

	At The Coma
	The woman's husband had been slipping in and out of a coma for several 
months, yet she had stayed by his bedside every single day. One day, when he 
came to, he motioned for her to come nearer. 
	
	As she sat by him, he whispered, eyes full of tears, ""You know what? You have 
been with me all through the bad times. When I got fired, you were there to 
support me. When my business failed, you were there. When I got shot, you 
were by my side. When we lost the house, you stayed right here. When my 
health started failing, you were still by my side. You know what?"" 
	
	""What dear?"" She gently asked, smiling as her heart began to fill with 
warmth. 
	
	""I think you're bad luck.""

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

This is the infamous Year 2 Telecommunications bill that was for the T-1 or T-3 line (?) for the website that was used for day-to-day operational communications between 
BUG and ENA.  As we discussed last week, ENA verbally agreed to pay this bill over the term of the deal.  The cost of the telecommunications service was not 
explicitly covered under either the Supply or the Asset Agreement.  I am assuming that the settlement agreement will be covering this under the category of ""issues and

On October 31 I provided Jay Williams with a Draft MNA for FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc. (as per attached e:mail).  Jay informed me several days later that FPL Energy was dragging its feet until the contract netting arrangement that its utility, Florida Power and Light was negotiating with ENA was finalized (as per Jeff Hodge's e:mail, he's been working on that transaction).  I've check with Jay a couple of times during November and he has confirmed that FPL Energy is not yet ready to address a MNA.

It sounds as though the letter you received indicates that we need to be talking to someone at the holding company level (rather than at the FPL Energy level) about an MNA.  I'll be happy to help if given a contact.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Re the automotive gas sales LLC in Mexico, do you know if the Mexico group still plans to form an SRL for that purpose?  If not, perhaps we can delete or cancel the Delaware LLC that was set up to co-own it (the SRL) with a Dutch BV.  This LLC is one Kate Cole was asking about recently because I never did finalize the LLC agreement since the need for this LLC's existence was called into question right after we formed it.  

Re the Baja LLC and SRL set up for the FAPSA deal.  How is that deal progressing?  Will the companies be used?  If so, I need to change the officers and directors and I need your advice on which people in the company would be best in those capacities.

 1.  I am not sure that I would limit yourself to discussions on the price

      resolutions to avoid the reopener.

 2.  You make a reference in the letter to ""GSA"".  I do not think that is

Other than that, I am fine with the letter.  I will leave it to Richard to

1085,"As you may know by now, Congress has adjourned without extending the PTC (see attached).  The Democrats would not support any extenders bill as leverage to get a Stimulus Package passed and everything died.  The Speaker has asked the President to call Congress back on Jan 2 to debate the Stimulus Package, but that seems unlikely. The best we can now hope for is that Congress takes up PTC either as part of the Stimulus Package or an Energy Bill in Feb/March '02.  

For the wind co, this is good and bad.  The good is that while the Enron BK has kept customers away, at least now none of our competitors can book orders either.  My hope is that PTC extension and the announcement of a new owner for EW will happen about the same time.  The bad news is that it means our US business will be further hurt - a 200 unit '02 is now out of reach and a 100-125 unit year may be the best we can hope for (assuming the PTC is extended in Q1).  (Maybe the Candover folks knew something we didn't, although I doubt it).  For sale purposes, we will run our '02 numbers at 150 units and put as positive a spin on it for bidders as we can.  Bottom line is that '02 will be a break-even to small profit year for us in the US.

Stan - we are in the process of revising our financial projections for a teaser to be sent out to bidders next week and this news will be reflected in those projections (meaning that the sale projections will now differ slightly from what we submitted to Enron earlier this week).  Also, we have launched reductions in force in the US.  I will reduce our MFG workforce by around 85 right after the first of the year and expect to have to let another 100-150 go early in Q1.  I will keep you posted.

there have been rumors circulating that an attempt may be made to soemhow

MCCAIN WANTS PIPELINE SAFETY BILL OUT OF FINAL SPENDING PACKAGE:
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., has asked the Senate 
leadership to keep a pipeline safety overhaul out of the final appropriations 
bill. In a letter to Majority Leader Trent Lott, Miss., and Appropriations 
Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, McCain expressed reservations about 
inclusion of the pipeline bill (S 2438), which the Senate passed by unanimous 
consent on Sept. 7. McCain wrote that while he supports the legislation, he 
does not want authorizing provisions in the final appropriations bill. He 
added that the legislation ""is the product of months of work and bipartisan 
negotiations by the Senate Commerce Committee ... and should in no way be 
weakened to appease organized labor or any other special interest group."" The 
measure failed in the House Oct. 10. The 232-158 vote fell short of the 
two-thirds majority required for passage under suspension of the rules.

<font size=""2"">""Because it's a family, Catholics around the country won't
give up on it very easily. There will be outrage and
embarrassment and anger, but the church is often referred
to as Holy Mother Church. And you might get angry with your
mother, but it's your mother."" <br>

Catholicism at Notre Dame.

I got this form agreement from Jeff.  It was prepared recently for PEMEX.  I understand it was approved for general use by Susan.  All I've done so far is change the names of the Parties and change the description of the purpose and asked Steve for comments on these questions:

	1.  TW or ETS?  Steve would like this to be as broad as possible, but ETS probably isn't a legal entity that can enter into contracts.  When we looked at TransColorado, we used Enron Pipeline Company.  Stan is an officer and can execute documents for EPC.  Steve wanted the Party defined to be broad so that it could encompass several possible entities on Enron's part.

	2.  Is the ""purpose"" appropriate per the discussions Steve had with Questar?  Steve said that the agreement should express the intent to evaluate for a partnership interest, possibly operating the Southern Trail facilities and/or purchasing a portion of Southern Trails.  Again, in any event, to be broad in this description.

  There was this little guy sitting inside a bar, just looking at his
  drink. He didn't move for a half an hour.

  Then, this big trouble-making truck driver stepped up right next to him,
  took the drink from the guy, and just drank it all down.

  The poor man started crying.

  The truck driver said, ""Come on man, I was just joking. Here, I'll buy
  you another drink. I just can't stand to see a man crying.""

  ""No, it's not that."" the man said. ""Today is the worst day of my life.
  First, I overslept and was late for an important meeting. My boss became
  outraged and then fired me.

  ""When I left the building to go to my car, I found that it was stolen.
  The police said they could do nothing. I then got a cab to return home,
  and after I paid the cab driver and the cab had gone, I found that I left
  my wallet in the cab.

  ""I got home only to find my wife was in bed with the gardener. I left
  home depressed and came to this bar. And now, when I was thinking about
  putting an end to my life...

 Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.
 7. Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  ""(b) file a petition 
or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a 
proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of 
creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains 
undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected 
Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such 
proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable 
documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be 
dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to 
effectuate such dismissal,""
 8.  Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  ""20 or more Gas Days"" is acceptable.
 13. I will change the definition of ""Act"" as you suggest.
 21. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt 
to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by 
mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the 
satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the 
use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable resolution?
 22. We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into 
transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever answers the 
trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company.  
However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people 
on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is 
signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction 
with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.  Of course, 
the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact 
list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?  

Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.

Quantum will execute the mortgage for itself, the five listed programs.

 2.4.      Begin the first sentence with ""Except for the express duty

 5.4 (a)  Increase reportable damage amount to $5,000.00

Also please add a multiple counterpart signature provision so that, if
necessary, signature pages can be assembled
and attached to the original agreement.

The Campbell county clerk refused to record the State of WY Lease because it
does not contain an acknowledgment.  The clerk, however, said that they
would record a certified copy.  The State Land Office no longer provides
certified copies of their oil and gas leases, ergo, we could not record a
certified copy of the lease.

If you want to record the lease, I'll have Gregg Colton at Pioneer Oil and
Gas send the original lease to you to be recorded as an attachment to an
affadavit of identification.  At this stage of the process, I think it more
expeditious for you to control that process too.

Short of recording the lease, you can confirm the ownership of the lease
through the WY Office of State Lands and Investments, Phone # 307 777 7331;

1122,"Alrighty. Here is a complete look at what we have 'pending' with Alagasco. 
I'm expecting a call back next week from Amy McEntire (Alagasco's attorney) 
in regards to further instruction on what to do with the stragglers 
(outstanding deals). Based on my conversations today, it appears that 
Alagasco is showing these deals on other CES contracts (contracts for which 
we are encountering a volume constraint), if we can verify this via 
confirmations (Jennifer Blay is currently researching) then the issue will be 
volume constraints rather than term dates. TAMMI, can you verify if deal #s 
242653 & 271301 are CES deals or ENA deals (there are no notes relating there 
back to CES)? If they are ENA deals, we should be able to move them over to 
the 'new' (9/1/99) Enfolio contract without the same tangles we are 
encountering with the CES continued deals. Also, can you confirm that these 
deals are not bound by a demand fee? Reason, the CES contracts stipulate 
demand fees (as listed on spreadsheet) - - - - - if the deals are ENA & do 
not have demand fees associated with them - - - - - - then they do not belong 
on the CES Ks and moving them should be easier (assuming that we are able to 
explain this to Alagasco as this will change the Confirming party & trigger a 
confirmation being sent to their offices). DAN, does all of this sound right 
to you? Depending on how Amy & Roger view things - - - - - - the move may 
just be a ENA booking issue. I'm a bit fearful that they may use this as an 
opportunity to renegotiate the demand fees associated with these long term 
deals. In addition, if they decide to allow the deals to ride on contracts 
where we encounter a volume constraint - - - - - - I'm assuming that they 
would initiate an amendment to reconciliate the contracts with the 
transactions. If they do not initiate - - - - - guess that will be a bridge 
crossed when we get there?
Anyhow, TAMMI, I hope the spreadsheet helps if Roger should call before I 
hear from Amy. DAN, I'll let you know the volume issues as soon as I get my 
hands on copies of the confirmations that should have been sent by Alagasco.
Depending on who gets contacted first - - - - - please let me know if 
anything new pops up.

Attached are revised and clean versions of the Beta Agreement for Coral.  I 
placed a call to Coral to confirm that I have the proper entity listed, but 
have not yet heard from Ms. Reynaud.

Also, in making the revisions, you will note that I have kept the concept of 
the Electronic Agreements.  This has been retained so that it is clear, as 
stated in Paragraph 1 (to which Coral had no objections), that any use of a 
production version of the system will be subject to ""Electronic Agreements.""

database designed, we're working some kinks out and I hope lawyers can start 
briefing the country information soon.

Of course, the compelling project for us over the last 6-9 months has been 
online trading.  I was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the 
business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract 
information.  With thousands of counterparties being approved initially and 
on a ongoing basis we needed a database to keep track of which counterparties 
we have approved or disapproved, and tie each product to a contract.   We 
have that system ready now and I am finishing having the data inputted.

The other part of the system will be our Library of research memoranda, legal 
advice, etc.  This will be a cross product library (financial, physical, 
power, etc).  I think I am going to dupe a database the European office has 
in place to create ours.  The major complaint I have heard from some of them 
is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they 
want them.  So I've got to create a lawyer user friendly index.    Among 
other documents, this is I think where our forms might reside, in addition, 
all the research and advice on various legal issues we've received from 
outside counsel, as well as ISDA Netting Opinions and the like.  I think this 
Library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being 
scanned into and kept.  I think we can buy a scanner that will scan the 
documents in, then the web is already set up so we can have our documents 
available around the world.  So the setup for this might go quickly, although 
compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might 
be more of a problem.

The last part we've got to develop is the then overall place or site for all 
these various databases.  So I think necessity has made me develop the pieces 
before the overall system. 

Maybe when you have time we can have a chat about all this.",,,ENA ISDA Netting Opinions

1292,"I was curious about the accuracy of our credit reserve model as a function of 
the
number of simulations we use. This question, I think, is not so important 
when we 
calculate credit reserve, because the assumptions underlying our model are 
pretty 
rough anyway (here I mean the assumptions regarding price processes, 
correlations, etc.)

This question becomes more essential when we talk about calculating 
sensitivities of the 
credit reserve to various factors. When the magnitude of the sensitivity is 
comparable
to the accuracy of calculation of the credit reserve, what is the accuracy of 
such sensitivity?
  
I performed a numerical experiment where I calculated the expected loss
for a simple portfolio with one counterparty (SITHE IND POWER) for different
number of simulations (10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000) using old research 
credit model.
You can see how the result converges and the relative error (compared to the 
result for 100000 simulations which is assumed to be the most accurate) in

new ones are likely to emerge?  Join us for a comprehensive two-day
training workshop March 1-2, 2000 that addresses these issues and
accommodates both new and experienced professionals.  Hosted by the Energy
Institute at the University of Houston's College of Business
Administration, the training workshop features an introductory day that
will refresh participants on the basics of the electric power market and
key aspects of the restructuring process in Texas and the U.S.  The second

the CalISO.  The ISO combines the curves from participating SCs (of which I
believe Enron is one) and calculates the uncongested and congested prices. 
The CalISO prices are available from RDI PowerDat, the Enron LIM database, and
a number of other sources.  Recent historical prices are available from the
CalISO web site.

I am copying your mail to Tim Hiezenrader, who runs the Westdesk Fundamentals
group.  I believe he would know how you might be able to access the more
real-time CalISO data that Enron collects.

Tim, can you help Jason out?  He is a manager in the ENA Research Group.

Thanks,

Thanks very much for taking the time to talk with me about my
electricity model when you visited Carnegie Mellon. (I was the PhD
student in Finance who had a two-factor model for pricing
electricity. My model incorporated strategic behaviour and varying
price elasticities across different consumers of electricity). While here,
you mentioned the possibility of further developing my model at Enron.
One avenue you suggested was through the summer internship program at
Enron. If this is still an option, I would very much like to talk with you
or one of your associates about working with or at Enron on my model.

Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal=

Asset Seizures
Since before the PG&E bankruptcy filing, we have maintained that asset=20

understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal=

courts, and would be a legal nightmare (there are a few minor Constitutiona=
l,=20
legal and interstate commerce problems). The main thing is that the seizing=
=20
would continue Davis's main approach to this problem -- management by press=

conference -- and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the right side=

of the issue -- punishing the capitalist leeches.  According to one senior=

Price Caps
One strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur=20
depends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from=
=20
Colorado, Alaska and Wyoming. These three were the key players during the=
=20
Portland Western Governor's Conference last January and, according to senio=
r=20
White House officials, it took the personal and prolonged intervention of=

President Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous=
=20
call for price caps from the governors. ""If they had signed that price cap=
=20
appeal,"" the administration source said, ""we would already have price caps.=
=20
So if they start to make it clear something has changed, we will have to=20

k=20
their opposition to price caps, the Bush administration will be forced to=
=20
reconsider price caps as a remedy for the West.=20

Cost Plus Caps -- Think of these as Republican price caps in that their fir=
st=20
duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to=20
provide power into the affected grid. Just to give some idea of magnitudes =
in=20
a cost plus deal, current discussions would put a cap on power costs at=20
something like $250 per kilowatt hour. That is a long way down from the=20
August futures contract that is pricing in $750 per kilowatt hour, but a lo=
ng=20
way above last August's $150/kwhr price and a particularly long way above t=
he=20
cost of generating this power, which is something like $25-30/kwh.=20

Market-Price Exceptions -- The option allows the Bush administration to hav=
e=20
political credit for imposing price caps. As we write, FERC is currently ,i=
n=20
the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating=20
power in California (Duke, Dynegy, AES, Reliant and Williams).  The permit=
=20
grants a further three-year waiver that allows them to sell power into=20
California in the existing ""whatever price the market will bear"".  In other=
=20
words, FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy=
=20
at the market price, perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market=
=20
share, and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC.=20

Technically, in granting the extension of these permits, FERC has to=20
establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield ""mark=
et=20
power"" -- that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding=
=20
power at crucial times. Of course, FERC has just found on three different=
=20
rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind =
of=20
ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the=
=20
subsequent price spikes. But that would mean FERC would have to want to wie=
ld=20
effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no=20
desire on that front. The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waiver=
s=20
is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers=
=20
controls more than 20% of an electricity market and none of these companies=
=20
come close.

In other words, the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush=20
administration and FERC commissioners really want to escape. Once again, th=
at=20
decision may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than=20
anywhere else in the country. But you can be certain that in the past few=
=20
days Administration officials have become fully aware of the potential=20
political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and=
=20
coal power plants.=20

Democrats Seize Opportunity to blame Bush
Senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could=
=20
come in as high as $60 billion, which would destroy state finances for a=20
decade.  Add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear=20
everyday about their own direct out-of-pocket electricity costs (they paid =

has advised Enron that MERC has no jurisdiction over the PPA and cannot 
establish regulations on things like merit order dispatch, much less set the 
merit order dispatch.  A written legal opinion has been requested.  The 
thought of the Linklaters attorneys (both Sandeep Katwala and Chris Walker) 
and tentatively Wade is that the MERC may be DPC's worst enemy if it has 
jurisdiction over the renegotiated PPA (which it will) and must approve it; 
thus, it may be better to take the offensive and challenge its jurisdiction 
over merit order dispatch.    The strategy isn't fully formed yet, but I 
wonder about the wisdom of (i) taking on a regulator that could be in a 
position to approve a renegotiated PPA; and (ii) how a jurisdictional 
challenge to a regulator attempting to restructure squares with Enron's 
positions/reputation worldwide.  I'll be discussing this with all parties 
when I get back to work after New Year's and will let you know as this issue 
progresses.

Enron is as I speak seriously contemplating pulling the letters of credit.  
We've been told by the Chairman of MSEB that he has some money but he is not 
going to pay October's bill for DPC.  According to him, DPC was forced on 
MSEB by the Gov't of Maharashtra, so we should pursue our financial and legal 
remedies.  The Government of course will want to renegotiate in exchange for 
payment.  Here we go.

The first point is the most critical.  It exposes customers to exit fees if 
they go DA before the effective date.  If we can argue to the DWR that no 
costs were really incurred by them - in fact, their burden was relieved by 
load going DA - this problem goes away.  Better to clarify in the legislation 
if we can.  Other than that, a couple of the Christmas tree ornaments have 
been taken off.  (These were nice, but, let's be realistic).

Seems to me this is still a pretty good bill!  (especially if we can clarify

1358,"Premise: FERC should investigate the utility decisionmaking that led the 
Califonia market to the point of excess gas demand, rather than rush to 
impose gas price caps.

Utilities had ample opportunity to fill up storage last summer, but most 
likely choose not to for price reasons.

Transwestern had at least a 100 M/D of available capacity to Califonia and to 
the SoCal Needles delivery point through July 2000.  
 
 Avg. Scheduled (compared to 1.1 Bcf/D capacity): April  780 
        May  820
        Jun-Jul  980
        Aug  1050
        Oct-Dec 1080 (essentially full)

During the period April-Jul, TW was able to deliver up to the full 750 M/D at 
Needles, but on many days SoCal gas instituted ""windowing,"" lowering the 
ability to take at Needles to 680-720 M/D.  SoCal's argument was that they 
didn't believe that there was sufficient demand to run at the 750 M/D level 
(even when TW had nominations of 750 M/D).

El Paso was also not full to Califonia until the last month.   At all times 
El Paso  had available capacity at PG&E delivery points.  During the pipeline 
outage El Paso was limited in their ability to fully deliver to the North 
SoCal delivery point.  However, they were not full for deliveries to SoCal at 
the south system delivery point.

Sempra protested Transwestern's 140 M/D Gallup expansion, arguing that there 
is no need for new capacity (CP99-522).

Anatomy of a Jolt

A timeline of key events in California utility
deregulation

1993 The California Public Utilities Commission's division
of strategic planning publishes the ""yellow book""
exploring how the state might deregulate its power market.

1994 The PUC issues an order, informally called the ""blue
book,"" that officially initiates a study of power-industry
restructuring in California.

1995 The PUC issues an order stating that electric
customers in California should be able to choose their
power provider by 2003 and that some of the state's
largest investor-owned utilities should sell a portion of
their power plants and turn over their transmission lines
to an independent operator to facilitate competition.

1996 Gov. Pete Wilson signs Assembly Bill 1890 to open
California's electricity market to competition. The bill
calls for most customers to get the right to choose
electricity suppliers in 1998, mandates a 10% rate cut the
same year for small commercial and residential customers
and allows the three biggest investor-owned utilities in
the state to issue as much as $10 billion in bonds to
finance the transition from monopoly status to full
competition.

1997 Utilities begin taking steps to divest themselves of
power-generation plants. Southern California Edison, a
unit of Edison International, and Pacific Gas & Electric
announce the sale of 13 generation plants in line with the
PUC's divestiture policy.

1998
* Rates that utilities can charge consumers are capped
until the utilities complete the divestment, expected in
2002.
* Small commercial and residential customers of
California's investor-owned utilities begin receiving the
10% discount on their power rates mandated in AB 1890.
* The California Power Exchange and the California
Independent System Operator begin functioning.
* Utility customers who chose an alternative power
provider also receive their first deliveries through the
new provider.
* Californians vote no on Proposition 9, a ballot
initiative that would have prohibited the use of customer
revenue to finance the utilities' bonds.

1999 San Diego Gas & Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy,
becomes the first California utility to deregulate,
allowing it to lift the price cap. Within a year,
customers' bills triple as the utility passes on high
wholesale power costs.

2000
* May 22: The California Independent System Operator,
manager of the state power grid, declares the first of 36
Stage 2 alerts, when power reserves drop below 5%.
* June 15: Rolling blackouts in San Francisco affect
thousands. The blackouts are caused by slim power supplies
due to several Northern California power plants shut down
for maintenance.
* Aug. 2: California agencies are beset by major
electricity shortages. Gov. Gray Davis calls for
investigation into possible price manipulation in the
wholesale electricity market.
* Sept. 7: State regulators approve a plan for San Diego
customers that caps their rates for three years.
* Sept. 11: Federal probe of California power prices
begins.
* Oct. 31: Federal panel suggests California abolish a
mandatory-buy rule.
* Dec. 7: ISO declares first Stage 3 emergency as power
reserves fall below 1.5%. Conservation efforts avert
rolling blackouts.
* Dec 15: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
approves a flexible rate-cap plan, but allows power
suppliers to charge utilities more if they can prove a
higher price is warranted.
* Dec. 26: Southern California Edison sues FERC, alleging
the agency failed to ensure that wholesale electricity is
sold at reasonable rates.

2001:
* Jan. 4: State regulators approve emergency rate
increases of 7% to 15% for customers of SoCal Edison and
PG&E, who say they have lost billions of dollars because
they cannot pass on high wholesale costs to customers.
They later warn of bankruptcy and layoffs.
* Jan. 11: ISO declares Stage 3 alert, but stops short of
ordering blackouts. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
extends emergency order requiring out-of-state companies
to sell power to California.
* Jan. 16: ISO declares Stage 3 alert as several plants
report a shortage of natural gas needed to operate. Edison
says it doesn't have the money to pay $596 million it owes
this week.
* Jan. 17: ISO orders the first rolling blackouts of
California's electricity crisis. The outages affect
several hundred thousand customers in northern and central
California. Gov. Gray Davis signs emergency order allowing
the state Department of Water Resources to buy power as
part of a plan to stave off the utilities' bankruptcy and
further blackouts.
* Jan. 18: California cuts off power to thousands of
people for a second straight day as lawmakers rushed to
enact emergency legislation to buy electricity at taxpayer
expense and keep the lights on.
* Jan. 19: State regulators slap California's two largest
utilities with an order barring them from cutting off
power to the 25 million people they serve. The lights were
expected to stay on through the weekend in California, but
the state order didn't completely erase the possibility of
more rolling blackouts ordered by managers of the state
power grid.

1367,"As discussed in last Friday's meeting on strategies related to higher energy 
prices, Harry asked me to develop the attached projection of delivered gas 
prices for this winter.

The projection is based upon EIA's monthly analysis of delivered gas prices 
for residential, commercial and industrial customers for selected states 
(Connecticut, Virginia, Illinois and Texas) for the 1999-2000 winter heating 
season (Nov-Mar).  Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the 
delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead 
prices for the 2000-2001 winter period.  A national projection is also 
included.

Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a 
smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial 
customers, the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced 
than for commercial or industrial customers.  In addition, LDC purchased gas 
cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent 
because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 
months in some cases).  Furthermore, some state public utility commissions 
(e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for 
ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases. That being said, Nipsco 
recently announced residential prices are expected to increase 50-60% this 
winter over last winter (in line with the projection for Illinois).

If you are interested in a similar projection for other states, or have 
comments with respect to the above let me know.

2.  Our understanding is that the House intends to attach the Bill to the

it difficult for Gramm to kill the bill.  The session may last until early 
Sunday morning.

during the next Congress - changes that most of the Senators would support.

By Julia King and Gary H. Anthes
(Nov. 20, 2000) Wall Street analysts and oil industry executives were thick 
among the legion of skeptics who thought Enron Corp. President and Chief 
Operating Officer Jeff Skilling was nuts to launch a Web site for the trading 
of natural gas and electricity over the Internet. 
That was last November, before EnronOnline locked up more than $120 billion 
in transactions in its first few months of operation, quickly establishing 
itself as the world's largest e-commerce company. As of Oct. 11, just prior 
to Enron's report of its third-quarter earnings, EnronOnline had executed 
more than 350,000 transactions, representing a gross value of $183 billion. 
Since then, the $40 billion Houston-based energy giant has elbowed its way 
into several new diversified markets. And it plans to continue its push into 
many more, ranging from railcar cargo space to broadband networking and 
data-storage capacity. 
In doing so, Enron is turbocharging its transformation from a stodgy, 
old-line fuel company to an entirely new kind of business-to-business market 
maker, with information technology and an all-out emphasis on 
entrepreneurship at the heart of its New Economy operations. Enron has been 
so successful in leveraging IT to pioneer new markets that others are trying 
to emulate its approach. 







First to Market 
""Enron often introduces a product before the competition even senses a market 
exists,"" the company says in its latest annual report. A prime example: 
online trading of data-network capacity. 
Indeed, ""there's a low degree of awareness [among carriers] about the 
bandwidth-trading business,"" and Enron is ahead of the game, says Seth Libby, 
an analyst at The Yankee Group in Boston. 
At present, there are only a handful of network professionals who are aware 
of these capacity commoditization plans, says Libby. But not for long, 
asserts Enron President?? Jeff Skilling. ""Within five years, the bandwidth 
market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets,"" he says. ""So for us, 
it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business."" That's 
currently a $35 billion business. 
But critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas, 
especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications. And critics 
add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell 
capacity, they might prefer to do it through some channel that's independent 
of the control of a single market maker like Enron. 
""Enron's argument is that its trading capabilities are the differentiator, 
and that it need not have deep telecom expertise,"" says Lisa Pierce, an 
analyst at Giga Information Group in Stamford, Conn. ""But I'm not convinced 
it's that simple. Technology isn't a long-term competitive differentiator."" 
Houston-based Enron Broadband Services Inc., formed last year, offers IP 
transport on its 15,000-mile fiber-optic network. Enron Broadband Services 
also trades - that is, makes a market by buying and selling - network 
capacity to and from other data carriers, conducting some of the transactions 
on EnronOnline. 
Enron Broadband Services also offers content-oriented services, such as a 
video-on-demand service it will market with Dallas-based Blockbuster Inc. to 
home viewers starting next month. 
""When we started the gas business, they told us we were nuts,"" Skilling says. 
""They said, 'You're going to sell gas but not own production? How does that 
work?' Then we did electricity and they said we were nuts again, and even 
louder than before. They said this stuff moves at the speed of light; you can 
never create a market. Then in telecommunications, they said we were nuts 
again."" 
Despite its share of skeptics, some experts like Enron's prospects in this 
space. ""I think aspects of this have the potential to be very big,"" says 
Libby. ""The carriers like the idea of instantaneous provisioning. And I think 
it has a lot of potential [for] . . . selling it to businesses and giving 
them the ability to cut their costs significantly by buying it as they need 
it."" 





""We aspire to that kind of model,"" says Fred Buehler, director of electronic 
business at Eastman Chemical Co. in Kingsport, Tenn. 
""In every sector, there will be one or two innovators who get out front and 
do things differently to create shareholder value,"" Buehler says. ""We're 
trying to be one of them."" 
Market Maker 
Stroll through the gas-trading section on the 32nd floor of Enron's 
glistening 50-story headquarters, and the company's technological 
sophistication is immediately evident. Traders like 26-year-old John Arnold, 
who personally executes about $1 billion per day in trades, have real-time 
access to virtually any information that might affect their split-second 
buy-and-sell decisions. 
That information might be a meteorologist's prediction of a 
colder-than-normal winter across the Plains states or a live news report of 
political instability in an oil-producing country in the Middle East. 
Behind the scenes, all of Arnold's trades are instantly analyzed and 
processed by a sophisticated, proprietary risk-management system and then 
updated across multiple back-end computer systems worldwide. Less than a year 
after launching the operation, 60% of the world's gas is traded on 
EnronOnline. 
""What we are doing, no one in the industry did 10 years ago. Eighty percent 
of our income this year is from businesses that didn't exist 10 years ago,"" 
says Skilling. 
For example, EnronOnline contributed heavily to its parent company's 
third-quarter earnings, which were up 31% to $292 million, compared with the 
same period last year. 
""The change is technology-driven,"" Skilling adds. ""We couldn't do what we do 
without massive amounts of computing capability."" In this regard, Enron joins 
a short list of companies that includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc., FedEx Corp. and 
American Airlines Inc., which famously pioneered various mission-critical IT 
techniques to leapfrog competitors and create a whole new class of IT-enabled 
industry leaders. 
Among Enron's boldest ideas is its use of a single, powerful software-based 
trading platform to insert itself as a principal buyer or seller in hundreds 
of different markets. Currently, Enron trades more than 1,000 different 
commodities, such as gold, natural gas and metals, on EnronOnline. 
""The core of our business is our business model, which is a centralized 
risk-management and market-making business model. It just so happens that the 
Internet is just perfect for improving the efficiency of that model,"" 
Skilling says. 
But as a market maker, EnronOnline stands alone. For starters, unlike most 
other Internet marketplaces, it's free. There are no transaction fees or 
catalog, inventory or subscription costs for users. 
""Enron has broken away from the pack in the last year, in terms of their 
capital growth,"" says Ian Wylie, vice president of e-business at BP Amoco PLC 
in London. ""And e-business is responsible for a lot of this change."" 
Even more unusual is Enron's role as a principal in each transaction. That 
means Enron is either the buyer or seller in every trade in which it's 
involved, unlike market makers that simply act as matchmakers between buyers 
and sellers. 
In fact, Skilling, as well as Mike McConnell, who heads EnronOnline's global 
expansion efforts as president and CEO of Enron Global Markets LLC, dismisses 
much of the current hyperactivity surrounding other fee-based 
business-to-business exchanges as a flash in the pan. 
""[Many of the] B2B guys think all you have to do is set up a bulletin board 
and people will start transacting, but it doesn't work that way,"" Skilling 
says. ""You need to know you can deliver if push comes to shove."" 
As either the seller or buyer in all of its trades, Enron, an established 
brand name with 32,000 miles of pipeline and deep financial pockets, 
guarantees delivery or payment on all trades that are executed on 
EnronOnline. 
""We're creating markets that were highly illiquid, so someone has to put 
their reputation on the line to say, 'We'll deliver,' "" Skilling says. 
But guaranteeing delivery also requires having guaranteed access to physical 
assets such as network bandwidth and papermaking plants. Guaranteed access 
also ensures marketplace liquidity. For Enron, this is where the bricks and 
mortar come in. 
For example, to help drive its liquidity in the pulp and paper market, Enron 
paid $72 million in July for Garden State Paper Co., a recycled-newsprint 
mill in Garfield, N.J. 
Skilling's current market fancy is metals, and in May, Enron bought MG PLC, a 
London-based metals marketer. ""You have to break the liquidity logjam, and to 
do that, you have to take a risk position,"" Skilling says. 
But once the logjam is cleared, Enron is just as likely to sell off the 
brick-and-mortar assets it acquired and use the cash to invest in new 
business. 
For example, to finance its new bandwidth-trading operation, Enron is selling 
Portland General Electric Co., a Portland, Ore.-based power producer that it 
bought in 1997, so it could bring liquidity to and guarantee trades in the 
online electricity market. 
Eventually, Enron may end up trading commodities that aren't even considered 
commodities - at least not at the moment - such as data storage capacity or 
empty railcar space. 
""Might we move into sauces or meats or grains? Potentially,"" says McConnell, 
who was Enron's de facto CIO before moving into his current role. 
""You have to be creative every day,"" McConnell says. ""You have to be 
open-minded to trying new things."" 
But what remains constant throughout all the upsizing and downsizing is 
Enron's core IT-enabled business model, which is what puts it in a class of 
its own, analysts say. 
""People have talked a lot about systems that they're about to roll out, but 
there is just not much out there for direct trading,"" says Mike Heim, an 
energy analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ""Enron rolled out 
its technology 10 months ago, and still there isn't much else out there. 
There hasn't been much competition [because] there isn't anybody in the same 
class."" 
But just last month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. launched Dynegydirect, an 
Internet-based, commission-free trading site for energy and communications 
commodities. 
Also last month, IntercontinentalExchange in Atlanta, whose partners include 
BP Amoco and The Hague-based Royal Dutch/Shell Group, added natural gas and 
power to its online trading system, which already included precious metals 
and crude oil. 
Skilling doesn't get called ""nuts"" much anymore. In fact, he's a darling on 
Wall Street, where Enron's stock has soared from around $40 per share last 
November to $81 as of this Nov. 2. As a result, Enron - by all accounts, an 
Old Economy gas pipeline company until 12 months ago - is widely regarded as 
a New Economy pioneer. 
Says Skilling, ""We like to say we were B2B before there was B2B."" 

Thriving On the Unconventional 
As head of two Enron pipeline subsidiaries, Mike McConnell knew a lot more 
about gas flows than he did about data flows last year when he got a surprise 
call from Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling. 
Recalls McConnell, ""Jeff went into this whole thought process about how the 
Internet is changing everything. He said, 'We need to make Enron an 
e-business, and I need a guy that can run this as a business. We need to 
change the way we view technology.' 
""I thought he was a little crazy and I said, 'Jeff, I'm not a technology 
person at all,' He said, 'No, seriously - this is going to be big.' So I took 
over as CEO of Enron Global Technology,"" and thus became the company's de 
facto CIO, McConnell explains. 
Appointing a person with no technology background to the top IT post is an 
unusual move. But Enron often defies convention and typically thrives as a 
result. Indeed, Enron boasts an entrepreneurial culture that's unusual in 
large, long-established companies, and in utilities firms in particular. 
McConnell relates the tale of how 29-year-old Louise Kitchen, Enron's head 
gas trader in Europe, spearheaded the creation of an online gas-trading 
system, recruiting IT people from elsewhere in the company to do the 
development work. Word of the Web-based platform, EnronOnline, which is 
literally remaking the company, didn't reach top management until a few weeks 
before it went live. 
Kitchen enlisted the support of Enron's initially skeptical top traders, and 
she scoured the company for software developers and other experts. Her small 
army of volunteers worked nights and weekends on the project while carrying 
on with their regular jobs. 
""It's an amazing story about not getting corporate approval and going through 
all the bureaucracy,"" McConnell says. ""No one went to the board and said, 'We 
want to change the way we trade.' You just do it."" 
Glowing Endorsement 
Soon after McConnell became the de facto CIO of the $40 billion energy 
company, he joined eight of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s top Houston customers at 
a breakfast hosted by Sun CEO Scott McNealy. 
""I was very nervous,"" recalls McConnell, 40. ""I mean, McNealy is the guy, and 
here I know nothing about technology. I'd been on the job maybe two weeks."" 
McNealy asked the attendees - all but McConnell were middle-aged CIOs with 
many years of IT experience - to introduce themselves in turn. 
""When Scott came to me, I said, 'I'm the CEO of Global Technology, and we 
want to be the leader in B2B commerce in the world.' He kind of sat back and 
said, 'How long have you been in the IT business?' "" McConnell explains. "" 
'About nine days,' I said, 'and we are going to take a little bit different 
approach to technology.' Scott chuckled and said, 'That sounds like Enron; it 
always looks at things differently.' He then stated that my CEO title and 
Enron's approach were very unusual but that it would be more commonplace 
soon, as this was the way of the future."" 
McConnell says McNealy's endorsement had ""a huge impact"" on how he structured 
IT at Enron during the following year. 
""I realized that we weren't too late to change our approach and take a 
commercial view of technology,"" he says - a view of IT as an integral part of 
the business, not as something that supports business functions. ""None of the 
other companies were thinking our new way at all."" 
Taking a commercial view of IT has led to a blurring of the line that 
traditionally separates IT organizations from the business units they 
support. When McConnell became CEO of Global Technology, Enron had five CIOs 
who were predominantly operating independently inside the company's major 
lines of business. 
""Each CIO had his own agenda, his own thought process, his own goals, and 
they did not communicate at all,"" he says. 
McConnell established corporate standards for IT, created a management team 
that included the five CIOs and put all IT people under a new chief 
technology officer, Philippe Bibi. 
But IT is far from centralized at Enron. ""We wanted to make people think 
about technology not as IT and support, but as an extension of your 
business,"" he explains. ""So we seeded people out into the business units. 
[IT] directs the performance review process, but the business units have the 
greatest influence on where the person actually ranks and is rated."" 
Firms like Enron that merge IT departments with the business units they serve 
will be the winners among fast-paced e-businesses, says IT organization 
expert Robert Zawacki, president of Zawacki and Associates in Colorado 
Springs and a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado, also in 
Colorado Springs. ""We need more entrepreneurial leaders in IT, and 
[McConnell] is certainly one,"" he says. 
IT makes it easier to be entrepreneurial, says McConnell, who is now 
president and CEO of Enron Global Markets. ""We really do like to try things 
and see what happens, and when you have an electronic platform like 
[EnronOnline] that we can model into different sectors, it's very inexpensive 
to try it. We are not afraid; if it's not working, we'll just stop."" - Gary

Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for
Manipulation by Power Firms

By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J. FIALKA
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

It's a market ripe for manipulation: surging demand for
an indispensable commodity, weak oversight and a
chaotic new set of rules amid a transition from heavy
regulation to open competition. This is the state of
the U.S. electricity business in the summer of 2000.
And sure enough, there's growing evidence that some
power companies are finding lucrative ways to exploit
the system -- at consumers' expense.

The tactics include manipulating wholesale electricity
auctions, taking juice from transmission systems when
suppliers aren't supposed to and denying weaker
competitors access to transmission lines. None of this
is illegal, and much of it might be considered basic
competition. But as an electricity shortage plunges
sweltering California into an energy crisis and fears
of even worse shortages rattle the Northeast, the
practices of power suppliers face more scrutiny than
ever. (See related article.)

Steamy Conditions

A hot summer day last year shows one kind of
manipulation. On July 28, 1999, wholesale electricity
prices in the Middle Atlantic states hit $935 per
megawatt hour. That was seven times what it costs to
generate power at the most expensive plant in the
region. An analysis of trading data from that day shows
that PECO Energy Corp. and PPL Corp., the old
Philadelphia Electric Co. and Pennsylvania Power &
Light, made the most of steamy conditions.

In the region's power market, deregulated in 1997, a
new corporation called PJM Interconnection LLC runs the
transmission system once operated piecemeal by eight
utilities. It also operates a daily electricity auction
that sorts the hourly bids of 540 generating plants.
The cheapest plants are called on first, but when the
weather is hot and demand is acute, higher offers are
taken as well. To attract as many bidders as possible,
the highest bid, each hour, sets the price for the
entire market for that hour.

Grid and Bear It

transmission-interconnection points for the month of
May from 1997 to 2000.

What PECO and PPL did was offer much of their output at
low prices so that the majority of their plants would
be called into service. But knowing demand was so high,
they offered power from their tiniest plants at vastly
higher bids, in a way that often set the peak price for
a number of hours. Consumers that day ended up paying
millions of extra dollars for power.

Cases like this show that during the transition to
deregulation, ""there's a good argument the system has
broken down,"" says William Massey, a commissioner at
the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency. FERC, which
polices the nation's bulk power markets, began the
deregulation movement in 1996.

It wasn't supposed to be this way. In the old days,
utilities generated electricity and delivered it to
customers in exclusive territories. To protect
consumers from gouging, rates were regulated. But while
supply had to be able to meet peak demand at all times,
demand varied widely within regions, between regions
and from one season to another. The result was
tremendous reliability but also inefficiency and waste.

Deregulation, now under way in half the country and
functioning nationally at the wholesale level, allows
new players -- some affiliated with utilities, some
not -- to build power plants and sell electricity.
Prices are supposed to be set by competitive markets.
Risks are borne by investors, not ratepayers.

At the same time, utilities are surrendering control of
long-haul transmission lines to new nonprofit
operators, like the one in the Middle Atlantic region,
which are supposed to ensure fair access to the grid --
the multistate system of high voltage lines.

Under this new regime, energy prices should have
dropped as companies raced to compete with one another.
But the massive U.S. energy infrastructure wasn't
designed to serve as the backbone of a free market. On
hot summer days, when there's little or no surplus
electricity in the nation's most populous regions,
generators can charge prices far in excess of their
production costs and be confident they'll get tapped
for service by grid operators who must keep the lights
on at any cost. Utility holding companies that still
control transmission lines have an added advantage:
They can effectively lock out cheaper competitors.

The new regional grid operators, called independent
system operators, or ISOs, eventually will be in charge
of preventing manipulation. But as nongovernmental
organizations, they won't have basic investigative
tools, like subpoena powers or the ability to impose
significant penalties. FERC, which does have those
powers, rarely uses them, preferring to let the market
discipline itself.

A Strange Drop

Sometimes it's difficult to know what constitutes an
abuse of the market. In July 1999, engineers noticed
that a substantial amount of power was being taken from
the grid for which there was no explanation. They
contacted the North American Electric Reliability
Council, the industry group charged by Congress with
overseeing the grid since the late 1960s. After a
lengthy investigation, NERC determined that Cinergy
Corp., a utility holding company, had surreptitiously
taken enough power over a three-day period, about 9,600
megawatt hours, to light a small city for a month.

Cincinnati-based Cinergy had underestimated power
demands. Rather than buy electricity on the open market
at ferociously high prices or cut power to Cincinnati,
it quietly borrowed power from the system when demand
was peaking and later replaced it in the cool of the
night when demand wasn't so high.

James E. Rogers, Cinergy's chief executive, received a
letter from A.R. Garfield, the chairman of NERC's
regional power-coordination center, accusing his
company of showing ""blatant disregard"" for the rules
and of using the grid ""as a supplemental resource
without regard to the reliability or integrity of the
system.""

But Cinergy paid no fine. That's because it runs its
own transmission ""control area"" and is trusted to
enforce NERC's voluntary rules, even when it is the
violator. Smaller utilities in Cinergy's area, by
contrast, face contractual penalties of as much as
$35,000 per megawatt for unilaterally borrowing from
the grid, a practice known as ""leaning on the ties.""

Dancing on the Edge?

Mr. Garfield is still steamed about Cinergy's actions,
which he said removed part of the system's essential
reserve needed to avoid cascading blackouts, or a chain
of uncontrollable outages that could darken whole
sectors of the country. ""How fair is it that someone
can dance on the edge like that and get away with it?""
he asks.

Mr. Rogers points to old rules that permit utilities to
temporarily borrow small amounts of power during
emergencies. ""We were very careful to make sure, when
we leaned on the ties ... we didn't bring the whole
system down,"" he says. Nevertheless, he concedes, ""in a
competitive world, those rules need to be changed."" The
region's regulators have since gone to FERC for
authority to charge ""borrowers"" for the market value of
the electricity they take off the grid.

Leaning on the ties is only one way fair competition is
being frustrated on the country's transmission system,
a vast web of connections that resembles the nation's
highway system before the construction of the
interstates. While there are plenty of routes to get
electricity from outlying power plants directly to big
cities, there are relatively few routes connecting
regions. That makes it possible for some big companies
to shut out competitors.

A Snag in Transmission

St. Louis-based Aquila Energy hit that snag when it
tried to use a transmission corridor owned by New
Orleans-based Entergy Corp. to move electricity to a
buyer in East Texas. Entergy granted the request,
initially, but then it canceled, saying it didn't have
sufficient space on its lines.

Aquila didn't buy it. After analyzing
transmission-capacity data, the company argued to FERC
that Entergy did have enough space on its lines and so
was in effect breaking a rule that required it to
provide transmission-line access when possible. Without
access to Entergy's lines, Aquila was forced to
compensate the buyer and lost nearly $300,000 on the
deal. From whom did the Texas customer end up buying
the power? A unit of Entergy -- and for a higher price
than it would have paid Aquila.

FERC said Entergy had been within its rights to
restrict access in this case, because it had
transmission problems. But FERC found that Entergy, on
other occasions, had hoarded transmission capacity that
should have been made available to the market. Entergy
declines to comment.

Such scenarios are costly for consumers, and they are
among the reasons the electricity industry is enjoying
flush times. In the second quarter just ended,
companies ranging from AES Corp. in Arlington, Va., to
Enron Corp. in Houston reported huge profit increases,
some as much as 50%. To be sure, a lot of those profits
are coming from extraordinary demand growth and a
pickup in energy trading. But Sean Murphy, president of
Southern Energy New England, a unit of Southern Cos.,
Atlanta, Ga., worries that the industry has gotten too
greedy and risks retribution. ""Pigs get fat, but hogs
get slaughtered,"" he says.

Tremendous Volatility

New federal data show that average wholesale power
prices have more than doubled at 14 of 17 key pricing
points across the country in the past three years. By
May of this year, prices had risen across a broad
range -- by 89% in Florida, for example, and by 294% in
Texas. But even these increases mask the tremendous
volatility that has struck all the major wholesale
markets during the past year. In the case of the
Midwest, where prices in July 1999 hit $9,000 per
megawatt hour, it was as if a $1.89 gallon of gas
suddenly sold for $567.

Prices like these have prompted growing calls for
investigations into whether electric companies are
gouging their customers. Some consumer groups, lukewarm
to deregulation in the first place, now are agitating
for re-regulation. Residential electricity bills have
doubled in San Diego, which is notable because it's the
first city in the nation to be served by a utility
that's buying all of its energy on the competitive
market.

Politicians are sounding the alarm in the Pacific
Northwest. There, wholesale prices peaked at a record
$1,300 per megawatt hour during the last week in June.
Energy-intensive industries like mines and aluminum
smelters are cutting back on production and temporarily
laying off workers. ""We may be seeing too much
opportunism in the market,"" says Montana Gov. Marc
Racicot. Demands by Mr. Racicot and his counterpart in
Washington, Gary Locke, were instrumental in prompting
FERC to open a national investigation in late July into
possible market abuses.

A Six-Month Lag

One big premise on which deregulation rests is that a
free flow of information will let markets police
themselves and operate efficiently. But a key tool for
market monitoring, the data on utility Web sites used
to book transmission orders, is often unreliable.
There's a six-month lag on the release of bidding data,
which are coded to mask the identities of bidders.

What's more, the four FERC-controlled ISOs operating in
California, the Middle Atlantic states, New England and
New York don't have the authority to compel market
participants to give them internal documents, like
bilateral contracts, and other information they don't
want to hand over. Without such documents, ""there's a
lot more looking than finding,"" says Bill Museler,
chief executive of the New York ISO.

Even if the ISOs do find something problematic, there
isn't much they can do about it. The tariffs, contracts
and bylaws under which they operate generally prohibit
them from releasing company-specific data and so
exposing wrongdoers. And with the exception of
California, the ISOs' own board meetings are closed to
the public. ""The reality is, confidentiality rules
protect the guilty,"" says Frank Wolak, a professor of
economics at Stanford University and chairman of the
California ISO's Market Surveillance Committee. ""And
there are no codes of conduct to instill a sense of
fair play.""

That can be a huge problem on hot days. In California,
an independent exchange runs a daily forward auction in
which it tries to match the next day's anticipated
demand to bids by generators. But this summer,
generators often have offered less power than they know
will be needed, so that they can submit higher bids
later when the ISO is forced to pay stiffer prices for
emergency power. On occasion, ISO engineers have had
just 40 minutes to frantically phone around and nail
down suppliers, knowing that if they fail they could be
forced to begin rolling blackouts. The bidding
strategy, while legal, ""undermines reliability and
forces the ISO to do some real gymnastics,"" says Kellan
Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the California
ISO.

Generators say they aren't to blame for the mad
scramble. Utilities, buying power for their customers,
often order less power than they really need for fear
that a big order will drive up the overall market price
to prohibitive levels.

The only real recourse available to the ISOs is to
rewrite the rules governing their local markets. But
FERC is reluctant to let them meddle too often because
generators are investing billions of dollars based on
existing market rules. There's another reason, too,
says Ron Rattey, a veteran FERC economist who in June
wrote a 10-page internal memo criticizing the agency
for not doing more to ferret out unfair conduct. ""Every
single ISO has identified strategic abuses,"" he says.
""And every time the ISOs make adjustments to the rules,
the market participants find new ways around them.""

I have been told that the severance program is ""under review"".

As you well know, many long term, dedicated Enron employees who have been with the company for nearly a decade have seen their entire net worth completely wiped out.  Retirement plans, college funds, etc have all evaporated.  Since the average tenure for an Enron employee is rather short, I believe that this subset is actually quite small.  This small subset of employees has been wronged.  I believe one way to cushion this blow is to alter the severance equation as follows:


4 weeks X (number of employment years)
1 week X  (each 10,000 of salary)

Example one: 2 year employee with an $80,000 salary = 2*4+80/10 = 16 weeks severance

Example two: 10 year employee with a $100,000 salary = 10*4+100/10 = 50 weeks severance

This will accomplish two tasks, one is to skew the severance towards the longer term employees, the other is to reduce the total outlay so as not to overburden the company (since the group receiving the higher severance is small). I believe this is fair to both the employees and to our soon-to-be new management.  Pls consider running this by management and or some focus groups, if in fact, the package is under review.

in Australia and areas in which I may be able to contribute.

As I mentioned in my previous email, I am also hopeful of gaining further
experience in international energy markets, particularly the US. I think my
experience and contacts among Asia Pacific countries, and the skills I've
developed, can be applied to the North American market and that I could
offer a very positive contribution to Enron either on the regulatory or
commercial side.

As I am being married in the US this July, and am able to obtain an
appropriate (non-expat) working visa, I would be very interested in suitable
opportunities with Enron either in Houston or other parts of the US. Do you
believe that I am being realistic in pursuing opportunities in the US market
or should I rather concentrate on the Australian market?

Thank you again for your assistance in this matter.

Yours sincerely,

This is not very illustrative example. Utilities (ENEL distcos and 
municipalities) will not be allowed to sign long-term supply contracts with 
producers (ENEL gensets or divested ENEL gensets). Even, according to the 
last draft of market design recently published by the regulator, the single 
buyer will also need to procure power for non-eligibles through the 
forthcoming pool.

ENEL's divestiture has rather more to be with limiting market power and 
spurring competition than securing supplies.

Portugal

This could be more helpful. Here, the dominant SEP (public sector, ie, tied 
gencos and tied customers) security of supply is based on a rock-sodlid 
long-term power purchase agreements. The SEP is characterised by long-term 
contracts between REN (the TSO), public and private (vgr. Pego, owned by 
National Power, Endesa, EdF and EdP) gencos and the four EdP's distributors. 
Individual power purchase agreements are concluded for each plant, and cover 
the plant's entire economic lives and commit gencos to sell to REN 
exlcusively. 

New power plants to be dedicated to SEP will be open to tender, according to 
a central planning. REN buys power from these tied gencos at each plant's 
costs and sell to the distcos at a uniform rate, the bulk supply tariff (BST).

Unfortunately, the record of the tendering process open to private investors 
is not either long or very transparent, and we could not draw many good 
lessons from this. For example, EdP has been trying in the last two years to 
build additional capacity for SEP without a tendering procedure.

Dynegy and Enron
Announce Merger=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis


[News item from Reuters] Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) agreed on Nov. 9 to acquir=
e rival Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) for some $9 billion in stock, underlining t=
he dramatic reversal of fortunes for the Houston-based energy trading giant=
 that was valued last year at nearly $80 billion. Enron's stock fell sharpl=
y in the past month due to investors' concerns about murky transactions tha=
t sparked an investigation by U.S. regulators and damaging downgrades by cr=
edit rating agencies. The merged company will retain the Dynegy name. It wi=
ll have annual revenues of more than $200 billion and assets worth $90 bill=
ion, including more than 22,000 megawatts of electricity generating capacit=
y and 25,000 miles of natural-gas pipelines. It will be North America's big=
gest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity, positions previous=
ly held by Enron.

Analysis: Well, it's now official. The announcement of what presumably will=
 be the final chapter in the Enron saga came with much fanfare at the end o=
f last week. It is indeed a dramatic end. Enron, the maverick and innovativ=
e company that has often been credited for literally creating deregulated m=
arkets in the energy industry, will no longer exist after what has been a v=
ery quick and unbelievable fall from grace over the last several months. Dy=
negy, the slow and methodical company that took a more traditional approach=
 toward success, is making a stunning acquisition of its formal rival and l=
ocking in much of the industry market share of Enron. Can there be any doub=
t that this is the energy industry's manifestation of the tortoise and the =
hare parable? Enron has clearly lost the race to Dynegy, but is making a sm=
art choice to be bought, considering its desperate circumstances and the un=
likelihood of its regaining financial strength on its own. For Dynegy, this=
 acquisition is a major win, as the combination will create the biggest and=
 strongest energy merchant in the world.=20

There are so many interesting dimensions to this mammoth deal. Before addre=
ssing some issues related to the approval of the deal, let's establish some=
 of the key points of the merger agreement. There have been some mixed repo=
rts, but it is generally believed that Dynegy is buying Enron for about $10=
 a share, quite a steal considering that just over a year ago Enron was tra=
ding at close to $90 a share and had a market value of nearly $70 billion. =
Under terms of the agreement, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 Dynegy=
 shares per share of Enron common stock. Dynegy's current stockholders (inc=
luding ChevronTexaco Corp., which currently owns 27 percent of Dynegy) will=
 own approximately 64 percent of the combined company, while Enron's stockh=
olders will own approximately 36 percent of the combined company's stock at=
 closing.=20

In addition, Dynegy will provide an immediate $1.5-billion asset-backed equ=
ity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financial woes=
, followed by an additional infusion of $2.5 billion into the combined comp=
any by ChevronTexaco. Chuck Watson, chairman and CEO of Dynegy, will retain=
 his position at the new company. Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy, and=
 Rob Doty, chief financial officer, will retain their positions at the new =
company. It is not presently known what role, if any, Ken Lay, current CEO =
of Enron, will hold at the new company.=20

Of course, this acquisition could not have taken place if Enron had not fal=
len into a very vulnerable spot this year. Quite literally, Enron was pushe=
d into this deal because it was running out of cash, its stock had tanked a=
nd its credit ratings were slashed to near junk levels, all within the last=
 several weeks. Enron's decline over the course of 2001 has been the result=
 of losses in its telecom sector, losses from its involvement in India, the=
 departure of its former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, a Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission (SEC) investigation into some of its business practices, and lack =
of investor confidence about Enron's honesty in its financial reporting. Th=
is last point gained validity last week when Enron announced that it had ov=
erstated earnings by 20 percent over the last four years and investors shou=
ld disregard the company's financial statements from 1997 through the first=
 half of 2001. The restating of its earnings for the last five years sliced=
 $591 million from Enron's reported profits. In addition, Enron revised its=
 debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2000. At the end of 2000, Enron's de=
bt was $10.86 billion, $628 million more than it had previously reported. B=
y not reporting this debt earlier, Enron presumably was able to maintain a =
stronger credit rating than it would have had the accurate records been dis=
closed.=20

The key value for Dynegy in this acquisition is Enron's successful energy t=
rading business. In addition, Dynegy could also find synergies in Enron's r=
etail unit, Enron Energy Services and EnronOnline, the company's electronic=
 trading unit. Dynegy has a similar trading site known as Dynegydirect, whi=
ch was launched after Enron gained the first-strike advantage in this marke=
t space. Details are still emerging, but it would make sense if Dynegy opte=
d to not purchase other units under Enron's business structure, such as the=
 company's water and telecom businesses, which are losing money. Dynegy has=
 its own telecom unit, which has also lost money this year, so it may not w=
ant to expand in this slow-growing sector at this time. Vivendi Environneme=
nt, a French company that has expanded into various lines of business, has =
reportedly expressed interest in the remaining subsidiaries of Azurix, Enro=
n's struggling water subsidiary. Note that Enron sold Azurix North America =
to American Water Works.=20

The deal is subject to regulatory reviews and shareholder approval from Dyn=
egy and Enron shareholders. Dynegy shareholder approval may be contingent u=
pon any possible downgrades on its long-term debt that Dynegy could encount=
er with the purchase of Enron. At this juncture, it does not appear that Dy=
negy will be downgraded, but this is a fast-changing story and conditions c=
ould change abruptly. Financing the deal may also be an issue, even with th=
e infusion of capital from ChevronTexaco. Dynegy reportedly has $3 billion =
worth of debt and has a market capitalization of $11.7 billion. Thus, Enron=
's own more substantial debt may be too significant for Dynegy to absorb, a=
 concern that may cause Dynegy shareholders to veto the deal. This issue co=
uld be helped if Dynegy only elects to purchase some of Enron's assets and =
if there is some repair work done on Enron's balance sheets.=20

The issue of regulatory approval could be difficult, as the combination of =
the two huge companies may cause regulators to be concerned about market po=
wer and antitrust issues. The review of this merger will be unprecedented, =
considering that the wholesale natural-gas and electricity trading market i=
s still fairly young. Certainly, a deal of this magnitude has not previousl=
y occurred in the deregulating energy industry. It is not presently clear w=
hich regulatory agency will be involved in the review, although the Federal=
 Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Federal Trade Commission and the =
Justice Department could all be involved. FERC would most likely become inv=
olved only if the acquisition includes the transfer of a physical asset, su=
ch as a pipeline. FERC may not become involved if the deal is structured so=
lely as an exchange of stock. Not involving FERC would be more advantageous=
 for Dynegy and Enron as the timeline for approval would be significantly s=
horter.=20

An issue that most likely will be at the top of the list of review items fo=
r regulators would be the extent to which the combination of Enron and Dyne=
gy would hold market power in the natural-gas trading space, which could pr=
e-empt market entry by other competitors. The combined company would be con=
siderably larger than its nearest competitors. Scope and scale are consider=
ed the top competitive assets in the trading sector, and the combination of=
 Dynegy and Enron will certainly have those assets in abundance. It will fa=
ll on regulators to determine if the combined company is so large that it p=
recludes other competitors from emerging into the same space.=20

To say that this deal is a sweet victory for Chuck Watson is an understatem=
ent. The two rival companies followed very different paths to success. Enro=
n, under the leadership of Jeffrey Skilling in particular, espoused an unor=
thodox belief that the company did not need to own physical assets in order=
 to achieve success in the energy-trading space. Dynegy, on the other hand,=
 approached the market from the opposite perspective, and diligently acquir=
ed diverse generation assets across the United States and internationally t=
o support its trading operation. Up until the start of 2001, it appeared th=
at Enron's strategy was the more successful of the two. Enron, with $100 bi=
llion in revenues and $1 billion in profits in 2000, ranked fifth on Fortun=
e 500's list of largest U.S. companies. In contrast, Dynegy ranked 54 on th=
e same list and had $29 billion in revenues and $500 million in earnings. H=
owever, 2000 turned out to be Dynegy's year and the success continued into =
2001, the very year that would bring Enron's downfall. Enron's problems cul=
minated in $638 million in losses in the third quarter, after taking $1.01 =
billion in charges associated with several of its non-core businesses. Take=
n with the other factors plaguing the company, Enron became exceptionally v=
ulnerable and prone to a takeover, which has now provided Dynegy with a str=
ong gain.=20

The purchase of Enron will literally quadruple Dynegy's size and should imm=
ediately provide an accretive earnings contribution. Further, Dynegy claims=
 that it expects a 15- to 20-percent annual earnings growth over the next t=
hree years following its planned acquisition of Enron. If it gains all of t=
he necessary regulatory approvals, Dynegy will become the undisputed market=
 leader in the energy industry, with annual revenues of $200 billion and $9=
0 billion in assets. The company will have 22,000 MW of generating capacity=
, which moves its closer to the previously established goal of accumulating=
 70,000 MW by 2005. In other words, the combined company will dwarf any oth=
er competition in the trading sector and be considerably ahead of its neare=
st competitors such as Mirant or Duke Energy in terms of size, resources an=
d assets.=20

Word of the acquisition caused Enron's shares to increase some, one of the =
few upward bumps that the company had experienced in the last few months. S=
hares of Enron rose 44 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $8.85 in mid-day trade on =
the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 9. As of early morning trade on Nov. 12=
, Enron shares were priced at $9.40. Shares of Dynegy gained $2.24, or 5.8 =
percent, to $41 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange.=20

the meeting.",,,
1419,"TVA and Entergy filed answers to the numerous protests to Entergy's source 
and sink filing.

TVA responded specifically to Enron and VEPCO's filings basically stating 
that the NERC letter was limited to the TVA/Enron dispute and inapplicable to 
the Entergy issue.  TVA also made accusations that Enron in effect secretly 
talked with NERC to get a task force made up of members ""predisposed to 
Enron's point of view.""  TVA said that the task force ignored TVA's requests 
to meet with it and that the task force went beyond current NERC policy.  
Finally, TVA understands that ""Enron has prevented SERC"" from bringing the 
matter to NERC ADR.

Entergy's answer largely cites past FERC orders that approved the source and 
sink on tags (and denied Enron's Capacity Reservation Tariff) and basically 
states that the protests are a collateral attack on Order No. 888 (as we have 
known, the OATT does require ultimate source and sink on firm and allows them 
on non-firm).  Entergy's filing, however, is lacking in substantive reasons 
why reliability would be so much better served by requiring this at the 
reservation level, when NERC has stated it is not necessary for reliability 
until the 20/30 minute ahead tag.  Entergy says it can do a better job of 
listing actual ATCs and will prevent Entergy from overselling its system 
(although since Entergy's ATCs are usually low or 0 coming in over the ties, 
I question how many times Entergy has oversold Firm transmission.)  Entergy 
also states that it and the Security Coordinators can police the IDC tags, in 
case the marketer puts the wrong priority information on the tag (how often 
does this happen?).  [[I also don't know how Entergy is going to have time to 
check all this, when we called FERC hotline on them last year for lack of 
timely responses to reservation and tags]].  Although the IDC does not even 
analyze specific bus bars (and generator source and sink are optional on the 
tags now), Entergy says this is ""irrelevant"", but TLRs will be improved.

Entergy cites FERC's 1998 OASIS orders that ""EPSA has not made a compelling 
argument that disclosure would harm liquidity.""  I think that the compelling 
arguments are being made now about the discrimination.  Although FERC 
approved the source and sink, transmission providers have not been using them 
and the tags don't require them.

Entergy notes that when FERC issued the OASIS order, specific bus bar 
information was required on the tag -- now it is optional on the tag.  Even 
so, Entergy states that requiring it on the reservation does not make it 
inconsistent with the tag.  (I disagree.)

Finally, Entergy says that we can always put in ""anticipated"" source and 
sink, but if it changes, our priority may change.  It is my understanding 
that even the smallest change in source and sink will make some change in the 
power flows, so you effectively would always go to the lowest priority.

We are considering filing a response that states the lack of evidence on the 
reliability issues when NERC doesn't think this is required is a material 
issue of fact that should be set for hearing, at least.

Morgan (for KN marketing affiliate violations).  You all may know this, but 
the FPA has similar penalty provisions for ""knowing and willful"" violations.  
Apparently though, it takes much more than simply winning a complaint (like 
Aquila v. Entergy, for example) to get FERC to threaten to refer the case to 
the DOJ for penalties.  I was wondering why Commissioner Massey filed the 
concurrence in Aquila complaining of the lack of sticks FERC has since it 
cannot award damages to the winning party and talked briefly with Dan W about 
it.  Perhaps if FERC finds some pattern of behavior in abuses by electric

1423,"Attached is the final agenda topics and attendees for the Gaz de France visit 
to Enron Monday, May 1, 2000.   Below a few other pertinent details.  

First
As you will see in the agenda,  a GDF representative will be giving a brief 
presentation at the very start of the Briefing   This person will highlight: 
Where GDF stands now in the market place 
What their rates are and how they stack up against the competition
What they hope to get out of Monday's meeting with Enron

NOTE - Past briefings have shown that it is very beneficial to have all Enron 
participants attend at least the first 30 minutes of a briefing to be 
introduced and to also hear the visitor's overview and it's relationship 
building.  

Second
GDF will be in the U.S. for one week touring the following companies in the 
gas industry:

East & West Team
Monday  May 1  Enron    Houston
Tuesday  May 2  El Paso Energy  Houston
     Reliant   Houston

Third:
The presentation will be projected off an LCD projector.   I will supply a 
wireless mouse and ""laser"" pointer for your use if you wish to use them.  
GDF attendees will receive a Welcome Package to include a color bound copy of 
the presentation, Note pad, Enron Profile and Enron Annual Report.

Lastly:
Restatement of Briefing Objectives and Theme

Purpose of the Visit:
For Gaz de France - 
To develop some insight in to what a competitive market place may mean for 
their domestic operations.  They want to learn from Enron's gas deregulation 
experiences.  

For Enron - 
Educate them on Enron's gas deregulation experiences and the outcome of the 
U.S. gas pipeline restructuring.
Help them to understand why they should embrace open access in order to help 
speed up open access in France.

Enron Messages:
Overall Message:
Incumbent utilities with the right (progressive) approach can not only 
survive but thrive under an open access regime.  The way to win is not by 
dragging your feet and trying to protect historical markets but embracing the 
change.  
Prior to open access
Emphasis on how bad things were prior to open access (the market moved from 
surplus to shortage/major commodity price swings and exposure to price risk)
After open access
Enron (even our regulated businesses) grew dramatically because the company 
embraced open access (throughput increased 40 to 50% w/o pipeline expansion)
Enron treated the transport business like a business, viewing producers and 
marketers as customers.

1428,"Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

David Haug.    David will be returning from his honeymoon on Dec 4 and has

regulation as well as the state and federal policy makers who have played an 
active role in deregulation efforts.  He would be great to have on a vetting

1454,"Terry, etal -

In response to Terry's comments, I have prepared an outline of what I think 
the Regulatory Risk Managment & Assessment Working Group will do.

Key tasks:

1. assist with the completion of the Regulatory Risk Management Process
 - do we have the right information
 - is the process leading to the right conclusions
 - etc.
2. act as chief liason for my group in Houston with the people in Government 
Affairs throughout the world
 - explain the process
 - explain the purpose
 -  help with questions from Government Affairs people thoroughout the world
3. act as Audit ""device"" for Mitigation plans
 - make sure that the Mitigation plans are followed through on by responsible 
party
4. provide oversight for ""risk"" assumptions
 - act somewhat as a neutral third-party for reasonableness of basic 
assumptions
 - ensure that the broader political context is captured in the modeling
5. other
 - ???

In terms of work load, I would hope that once the process is up and running, 
the work load will be minimal.  Clearly I would like the Working Group to 
stay informed of Enron's current Regulatory Risk position, but I don't think 
that this will be more than some overviews and responses to questions from my 
direct team.

Given this structure, I would hope that people with political knowledge and 
regulatory expertise are included.  For this effort, I need a team of people 
who understand every region of the world (or at least know how to find out 
about a specific country).

I hope this helps.  

Thanks,

JDS

After going throught the numbers on this peaker. I can only pay 4-5 cents for 
a 10 day peaker at Chicago. That would be a net payment to you of 
$604,000. 

You are giving me 6.6% of the underlying days and I will pay 10% of the 
underlying price to get the optionality.  As a relative value NYZ6 or Socal 
is worth much more.  Alliance seems to have taken all of the strong interest 
out of this market. Hunter won't pay any additional premium as Chicago is too 
liquid physically to justify a premium for the molecules.

1459,"Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:

Liquidity

EOL has allowed Enron to simultaneously provide internal and external 
customers with realtime  markets in many of the physical and financial 
products that we trade.  The ability of all customers to execute trades and 
receive instantaneous confimations has resulted in rapidly growing volumes 
and growing customer participation.  One of the benefits of this system is to 
allow all customers access to the market prices rather than being funnelled 
through third party brokers.  

Enron has committed to providing both depth of volume and tight bid/offer 
spreads. This committment has been main driver of the growth in volume since 
rollout last Nov.29.


Transparency

The existence of our two way market has removed all doubt about the firmness 
of bids and offers.  We will trade on the price and volume on our bid and 
offer.   The growing volumes over our system has lessened our dependance on 
the sometimes unreliable broker served market.  Many of our customers and 
competitors now use EOL as an information source as well as a trading 
vehicle.  EOL is the only service that provides free real time information on 
as many traded markets in the physical and financial worlds.  We have no 
competition in this regard.  This aspect of EOL has been helpful to the 
smaller customers that are not primarily trading operations.  

Deal Flow

As the market maker on this system we do derive some tangible trading 
benefits.  We are collecting the bid/offer spread on our transactions and 
over time this results in a direct bottom line benefit.    Enron's market 
share of financial tranactions will also increase overtime as we have become 
the easiest and most reliable way to transact in the market.

I really need to save money for the house and even though I'm passing on an
opportunity to make money, although that hasn't been the case my last 4
trips, I'm still going to have to pass.  Plus I might be going for another
bachelor party around the late Feb early March time frame anyway.

Yes Kyle Lilly is now working here.  His brother-in-law works here and I
think since they had there first child he was looking to get around more
family, neither his nor his wife's families live in Houston.  So anyway I
think we had been talking to him since the summer and it ended up being
pretty good timing since we didn't hire him until December.  The job is
alright.  The hours are starting to come back down and for the most part
everything is going good.  It seems like time of service has a lot to do
with moving up in this company and that is a little discouraging, but I
guess I will not worry about that too much.

Have you heard from Victor?  Has he found a job yet?

Well I hope you guys have fun and let me know how much money you win.

is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide=
d and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest=

A.	Market Updates

U.S. Markets

?	US equity markets are closed today but may open Friday. NYSE/NASDAQ/AMEX officials will reconvene later today to decide on restart.
?	Chicago markets  (CBOT/CME) closed early at 1:00pm CDT, CBOT electronic a/c/e trading expected to resume tonight for grains, and resumption of all commodities under consideration.
?	NYMEX: still closed, electronic Access trading planned to open later tonight (start time still under consideration)
?	In equity news, frightened travelers are expected to avoid planes once carriers resume flying, prompting Standard & Poor's to consider cutting the long-term credit ratings of all U.S. airlines, British Airways and Air Canada. That would raise borrowing costs and worsen the industry's least profitable year in a decade. The losses at U.S. airlines, until this week predicted to reach $2.6 billion, may now rival the $4.8 billion loss of 1992. 
?	In Europe, the four biggest airlines -- British Airways, Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Air France SA and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV -- will all now post a full-year loss due to their reliance on profits from the trans-Atlantic market. 
?	In Asia, services to and from the U.S. contribute 10 percent to 20 percent of revenue at Cathay Pacific Airways and Singapore Airlines Ltd. Some $3.8 billion was wiped off the market value of airlines based in Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and other Asian capitals in two days.  The plunge in stocks reduced the value of Asia's eight biggest carriers by about 14 percent.

B.	Transportation/Infrastructure Updates

Air Travel
?	145 domestic airports have now been cleared to reopen, though Logan International Airport will remain closed indefinitely, despite the Federal Aviation Authority's decision to open U.S. airspace for commercial airplanes.
?	At least some regularly scheduled United Airlines flights are expected to begin at 7 p.m. EDT Thursday, and some scheduled flights on American Airlines and TWA after 4 p.m. EDT.  Delta Air Lines said ""very limited operations"" would start sometime after noon EDT Thursday. Continental has canceled all regularly scheduled flights for the day, but planned to offer special service in cities such as San Francisco and Cleveland.

Maritime Transportation

?	Open, including NY harbor, which is doing individual vessels inspections and escorts into the harbor

C.	Political Updates

?	Indications are beginning to point to a substantial military strike against Bin Laden assets in Afghanistan as well as the Taleban government.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's chief economic adviser:  ""We've been working on getting the basic infrastructure of America up and running again, that's the main thing we've been doing.""
World Bank officials want to cancel their annual meeting in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund, now slated for Sept. 28-29 in Washington, according to media reports.  The DC police have also asked that the meetings be cancelled, but World Bank officials must wait for Treasury Secretary O'Neill to make the decision. Bank officials fear the Bush administration will want the meeting to take place to underscore that Washington is back to business as usual.

1502,"El Paso Line #1103

?	The El Paso restart approval has switched from the OPS to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).  The NTSB is currently investigating the explosion to determine a cause to the blast.

?	Once cause is established, the project will then shift back to the OPS, when they will begin to analyze the data from tests that El Paso is currently running.  At this point, OPS may request El Paso to either rerun certain tests or perform further repairs.

?	The individual at OPS (in charge of El Paso's South Mainline) indicated that all 3 lines were being investigated and tested.  OPS will begin to analyze the test data one line at a time (ex.  line 1103 will be completely tested, analyzed, and cleared for use before following the same steps for lines 1100 and 1110).  The source indicated that as these lines are being tested/repaired the current pressure on the system will not increase but instead be maintained.

1520,"Ken, Jeff , Joe & Cliff,

This is a copy a note I sent to PR(Steve Kean & John Ambler), IR(Mark Koenig) 
and Enron India(Sanjay Bhatnagar & Jimmy Mogal) regarding our internal 
announcement to  EGEP/EOGIL employees in Houston and India on October 13, 
2000.


On Friday (last night Houston time) we announced to employees Enron's 
decision to sell Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. (EOGIL), our subsidiary that owns 
a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have 
bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it 
extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were numerous 
rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement 
was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston. Basically we 
said the following:
 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to 
redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has 
exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not 
envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are 
placing EOGIL in the market.
 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we 
will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron 
entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL 
transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.  
 3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global 
E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001.
 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process. 
  a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process
  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale 
process
  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and 
coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development
 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told 
them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a 
PSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many 
people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers 
or through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with 
the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated 
March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide 
transition services to a buyer.
 
I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year when we were 
for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.  If anyone in 
the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.  Mike 
Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can 
be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).  He is fully briefed 
on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.  Mike will be 
traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.  I will be 
available all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work) 
713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713.  I would suggest 
talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.

This afternoon I notified our partners and the Gov't of India of our 
intention to market our assets.  I will be making a trip to India soon to 
visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two 
weeks.  While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries 
from our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me.  As you might 
expect, we want to be careful and consistent in our message to these 
groups.   

I will keep you informed regarding any changes to the above.  If you have any 
questions, contact me at the above numbers.

Any form of trading, including options,  hedging and spreads contains risk. Margins are subject to change without  notice.

orm   SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct 22, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circu=
its Corp.'s Switching and Network Processing Group (AMCC) (Nasdaq:AMCC) tod=
ay announced the nP7510 10 Gbps Network Processor, which is expected to com=
plete the industry's first software-compatible network processor (NPU) fami=
ly that scales from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps, from Fast Ethernet and OC-3 to 10 =
Gbps Ethernet and OC-192 Packet over SONET (PoS) and ATM applications.   Th=
e nP7510 represents the fourth generation in the company's nP7000 family of=
 fully software-programmable, policy-enabled network processors, and with t=
he nPsoft(TM) Development Environment, customers can easily preserve their =
investments in software from previous generations. The nP7510 complements A=
MCC's previously announced 10 Gbps traffic managers, framers, PHYs, and swi=
tch fabrics to form the industry's first complete integrated solutions for =
10 Gbps rate metropolitan area (MAN) edge, access, core router, and other a=
pplications. Designed with the company's core, patented Network-optimized I=
nstruction Set Computing (NISC) technology, the nP7510 achieves 10 Gbps rat=
es using just six of AMCC's own highly efficient nPcores(TM) and readily av=
ailable .18-micron CMOS technology, reserving smaller process geometries fo=
r future enhancements and multi-component integration. The maximum efficien=
cy of AMCC's core NPU technology allows for even greater potential future s=
caling to 40 Gbps OC-768 rates.   ""AMCC is a market and technology leader i=
n the network processor industry,"" said Linley Gwennap, principal analyst o=
f The Linley Group. ""The nP7510 gives the company a significant lead over i=
ts major competitors in delivering a 10 Gbps product. In addition, AMCC's c=
ombination of compatible 10 Gbps network processor, traffic manager, framer=
, PHY, and switch fabric components lets designers reduce time-to-market an=
d risk.""   The nP7510 represents the fourth-generation of AMCC's nP7000 fam=
ily of fully software-programmable, policy-enabled network processors and i=
s capable of wire-speed processing at 10 Gbps rates. The network processor =
offers enhanced debugging capabilities and minimized intrusiveness over pre=
vious generations with its On-Chip Debug Engine, allowing programmers incre=
ased visibility and flexibility when debugging code. The nP7510 features a =
new optimized memory interface for the six patented, highly efficient nPcor=
es(TM), enabling new savings in internal memory space. The device also supp=
orts a greater number of simultaneous tasks, or threads, than prior network=
 processor generations. The nP7510 is complemented by AMCC's nPsoft(TM) Dev=
elopment Environment, including C/C++ compiler, assembler, performance prof=
iling utilities, graphical symbolic debugger, the nPsoft Services framework=
 and API, and the core nPkernel layer that ensures developers can easily pr=
eserve software investments from prior generations. Ready-to-use switching,=
 IP routing, MPLS, and ATM application libraries from AMCC and its software=
 partners provide even greater options for fully integrated turnkey solutio=
ns.   ""Our field-proven, now fourth generation core technology not only let=
s us produce a wire-speed OC-192 NPU, but enables a complete scalable famil=
y, from OC-3 to potential future OC-768 line rates, without a major archite=
ctural overhaul,"" said Andy Gottlieb, vice president of marketing for AMCC'=
s Switching and Network Processing Group. ""AMCC's scalable core technology =
and complementary software architecture make possible new highly scalable c=
omplete network equipment systems products with a wide range of interface a=
nd uplink speeds, and our existing customers can leverage their prior softw=
are investments to further reduce both risk and time-to-market.""   While th=
e nP7510 can be used in a variety of configurations, including easy combina=
tion with other vendors or customers' own silicon, the nP7510 further demon=
strates AMCC's leadership in providing complete high-bandwidth silicon solu=
tions for intelligent optical networks by combining seamlessly with AMCC's =

COMMENT: God bless America! Let's hope American consumers are also blessed
with the resolve to keep shopping during these unsettled times! We are the
spenders of last resort. If we give in to terrorism, then the US economic
recession will worsen, and so will the global recession. That is why
President George Bush has been encouraging us to try to go back to business
as usual as best we can. Mayor Rudy Guilliani wants New Yorkers to spend
money at the stores, restaurants, and the shows. The President was right on
the money in his speech delivered Saturday in Shanghai when he observed that
the terrorists tried to disrupt the global economy. They are attacking
globalization. Mr. Bush intends to push for more globalization: ""First, our
governments must keep the path of economic progress. That progress begins
with freer trade. Trade is the engine of economic advancement. On every
continent, in every culture, trade generates opportunity, enhances
entrepreneur growth. And trade applies the power of markets to the needs of
the poor.""

It is hard to be bullish on the outlook for the economy and the stock
market, especially in New York City since the attack hit us so close to
home. Throughout the country, people are jittery about bio-terrorism. Yet,
we should remain optimistic that the disaster has created some opportunities
that may lead to better times again. Relations among the United States,
Russia, and China are improving as they confront the common threat of
terrorism. We are all taking this problem more seriously now as it is very
apparent that the random acts of terror around the world are not random
shocks, but rather coordinated attempts to destroy centuries of human
progress with the intent of restoring a medieval (and evil) new order. The
triumph of capitalism over communism more than a decade ago was not ""the end
of history,"" as suggested by some. The War on Terrorism may be an even
greater challenge to capitalism, but capitalism will triumph.

The end of the Cold War was very bullish for stocks. This was one of my
major themes in numerous Topical Studies that I wrote during the 1990s.
(See www.yardeni.com/topical.asp.) The end of the War on Terrorism is likely
to be equally as bullish if it leads to increased globalization, world
trade, and prosperity. But, this war has just started, it could last years,
and it isn't likely that any particular event will mark its end, as did the
demolition of the Berlin Wall mark the end of the Cold War. Some observers
see similarities between the two wars because they see a need to contain
terror now just as the United States struggled to contain communism in the
past. The difference is that the Soviets at least valued their own lives,
while the terrorists are suicidal and readily kill civilians.

SUBSCRIBERS: In this week's GLOBAL PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, I reassess the
outlook for consumer spending. I conclude that the key is jobs, as has
always been the case. The prospects are not good because many companies
over-hired during the 1990s. I also examine two other dueling excesses:
capacity versus liquidity. I am betting that liquidity will win, but not
until the second half of next year. In Monday's WEEKLY AUDIO FORUM, I'll
discuss this subject and explain why the widely embraced ""V"" scenario may
not be so bullish after all. In brief: A ""V"" can't happen unless housing and
auto sales plunge over the next several months. DBAB analyst Rod Lache will
join me to discuss the auto industry and to explain why Ford isn't giving
workers free PCs anymore.

PUBLIC: I concluded in my recent ""Global Strategist's Handbook: Stock Market
Cycles--Bottom Fishing,"" the panic selling during the week ended September
21 probably made a major cyclical low. Of course, another terror attack at
home could trigger a retest of that low. Heck, lousy earnings reports could
do the same. So could weaker-than-expected consumer spending caused by a
soaring unemployment rate, which could jump to 6% by the end of the year and
7% by next spring, in my opinion.

If September 21 was ""the"" bottom, then here are a few industries that have
had the best relative performance immediately after S&P 500 troughs since
1960: 1) Paper & Forest Products, 2) Department Stores, 3) Auto Parts, 4)
Thrifts, and 5) Truckers. If you think that we are still in store for a
1973/74 mega-recession, then the best relative performance prior to the 1974
stock market bottom was in: 1) Paper & Forest Products, 2) Chemicals, 3)
Aluminum, 4) Iron & Steel, 5) Metals Mining, 6) Containers & Packaging, 7)
Entertainment, 8) Domestic Integrated Oil, 9) Oil & Gas Drilling &
Equipment, 10) Money Center Banks, 11) Pharmaceuticals, 12) Truckers, 13)
Railroads, and 14) Gold & Precious Metals Mining.

The worst relative performers before the 1974 stock market trough were: 1)
Computer Hardware, 2) Retail Department Stores, 3) Consumer Finance, 4)
Autos, 5) Auto Parts, 6) Alcoholic and Non-alcoholic Beverages, 7) Personal
Care, 8) Property Casualty Insurance, and 10) Electric Companies. Of course,
as we all know, past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

THANKS BARRON'S: This week, in their annual ratings of web sites, Barron's
gave www.yardeni.com second place in the economics category. Other reviewers
have recommended our site. See the awards page at

Not Look Good     (RealTimeTraders.com) - Wednesday after the close Texas I=
nstruments reported earnings that top estimates by $0.01. Analysts on the a=
verage expected the company to report a loss of $0.04 the latest earnings c=
ame in at a loss of $0.03.  The problem with this picture is the future out=
look. According to the comments from Texas Instruments decline in semicondu=
ctor sales is expected to bottom in the fourth quarter. Despite the optimis=
m the company failed to say when it will return to profitability.  It is al=
so worth pointing out that Texas is expecting to report a loss of $0.06 for=
 the fourth quarter. According to First Call/Thomson Financial survey of 20=
 brokers had expected the company to to lose only a penny.  We at RealTimeT=
raders believe it is important to highlight that the company is expecting t=
o register a sequential revenue loss of 10%. We believe this may also press=
ure the stock. We strongly suggest readers watch the analysts comments and =
rating/earnings estimate changes.  Technical analyst point out that the sto=
ck recently bounced off the long term support around $20-22 area. Given the=
 negative outlook and the market volatility may lead potential retest aroun=

Cheap Tickets, Cheap Shares

By Chris Nerney

It's an e-tailer that still derives most of its revenue from non-Internet
sources, which, along with the amusing ads featuring William Shatner,
might explain why it has gotten less publicity (or notoriety) than chief
competitor priceline.com.

But though Cheap Tickets may have no high-profile celebrity pitching its
low air fares and hotel rooms, the Hawaii-based company does have one
thing for which priceline.com and its investors would no doubt pay dearly:
profits.

In fact, CTIX has run in the black for seven straight quarters, the most
recent (Q3) showing net income of $4.3 million, or 18 cents per share, on
revenues of $121.4 million.

In contrast, priceline.com, with much higher revenues of $341 million in
the third quarter, turned in a loss of $199 million, or $1.19 per share.
Last Thursday, the troubled ""name your price"" e-tailer announced yet
another round of layoffs and the cancellation of plans to expand its
services.

And while PCLN has been one of the biggest busts among 'Net stocks this
year - down 95% through Monday's trading, despite surging up 30% after
last week's news - Cheap Tickets shares have declined by only about
one-third since Dec. 31, closing Monday at $8.75.

Which could mean there's more downside coming for CTIX. However, the
company's highly favorable valuation should provide enough buoyancy to
prevent much more stock-price erosion. With a market capitalization of
$218 million, Cheap Tickets is valued at 0.5x trailing 12 months' revenue
of $416.5 million. That's the best revenue-multiple valuation I've ever
seen among profitable Internet companies.

Of course, as mentioned earlier, Cheap Tickets really isn't a pure
Internet play. Begun in 1986, the company's prime business - which
accounts for 94% of sales - is to purchase non-published air fares from
the carriers and re-sell them at a discount to consumers. Up until 1997,
all of its sales came through four call centers and a dozen retail
outlets.

This changed in 1997, when CTIX launched its cheaptickets.com Web site. By
last year's third quarter, 27% of sales came via the Internet. That
increased to 37.4%, or $45.4 million, in the recent third quarter.

Further, while Internet-based revenues are rising both on a dollar and
percentage basis, call center and retail revenues actually are declining
on a dollar basis as the company focuses more on the Web, a strategy shift
that has been accompanied by higher gross margins.

All of the above are good reasons to expect CTIX shares to rise. Now
here's why I don't expect them to rise too far.

The main problem is a severe slowdown in revenue growth. Sales in the
recent third quarter were just 10% above last year's Q3, down from Q2's
25% year-over-year revenue increase, which was way below the 65% increase
in first-quarter sales. Granted, the increase in Internet-based revenue
for Q3 was 53% over the year-ago period, but even that number isn't
eye-catching among 'Net investors.

Then there's the threat of competition, including Hotwire.com, a discount
travel Web site start-up that is being supported by a six major airlines.
Other airlines also should be expected to get more directly involved in
selling unsold and unpublished air fares, a trend will put even more
pressure on Cheap Tickets to develop other revenue sources.

With viable options for 'Net investors seemingly shrinking on a daily
basis, Cheap Tickets is definitely worth a look. It is profitable and its
shares affordable, which bodes well should a larger player eventually
scoop up the company.

The STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS

The NASDAQ and S&P 500 were higher overnight as they extend
Thursday's gains. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that
the rebound off last week's low is likely to continue into mid-June.
Closes above May's highs would renew this spring's rallies. Until
then one should view present rallies as corrective bounces.
Meanwhile, the Dow posted an upside reversal on Thursday following
Wednesday's corrective break. Momentum indicators are bullish
signaling that additional gains during June are possible.

European markets were higher in overnight trading despite a decline
in Germany's decline in industrial production and the continued fall
in sterling. Modest support due to gains on Wall Street led by chip-
related stocks along with a reassuring report from Intel Corp helped
underpin European stock markets overnight. The UK FTSE-100 was up
18.90 points at 5967.20 while the German DAX-30 was up 70.70 points
at 6254.95 as of 11:00 BST.

The Nikkei closed higher overnight as high-technology stocks
benefited from the Nasdaq's rally overnight and Intel Corp.'s
positive performance update. Overnight gains confirmed Thursday's
upside reversal as the Nikkei extended this week's rebound following
a test of the 50% retracement level crossing at 12,995. Friday's
gains have turned a number of oversold momentum indicators neutral to
bullish signaling that a short-term bottom has likely been posted.
The Nikkei closed up 152 points to 13,430.

INTEREST RATES

September bonds were slightly lower overnight due to spillover
selling following Thursday's round of profit taking, which led to a
key reversal down. Additional weakness during the day session would
confirm Thursday's bearish reversal pattern thereby increasing the
odds that a short-term top has likely been posted. Momentum
indicators are bullish but poised to turn bearish with additional
weakness.

The German bond market or Bunds were lower overnight. Dealers and
technical traders will be watching to see if the lower prices
realized over the past two sessions are enough to draw real money
investors into the markets. The risk in the market is still focused
on the euro and there is enough uncertainty there to keep investors
on the sidelines. The Sept. Bunds were last down 0.03 at 106.48.

Japanese government bonds closed lower overnight as traders closed
out their long positions ahead of the current lead June futures last
trading day on Monday. Firmness in the Nikkei weighed on JGB futures.

The ENERGY MARKETS were mostly higher in overnight trading due to
short covering triggered by refinery snags caused by stormy weather
in the U.S. Gulf. Additional support came from news that Exxon's
Baytown, Texas 110,000 bpd catcracker shut down on Wednesday for
repairs.

July crude oil was higher overnight in narrow trading as it continues
to consolidate above this year's uptrend line, which crosses near
27.10. Momentum indicators are bearish but oversold warning traders
to use caution as a short-term bottom might be near. Closes above
Monday's high crossing at 28.74 would temper the near-term bearish
outlook in July crude.

July heating oil was higher overnight as it is working on a potential
inside day. July's inability to close below Wednesday's low, which
now appears to have marked a double bottom sets the stage for a
possible short covering bounce in the near future. Closes below
Wednesday's low would set the stage for a test of May's reaction low
crossing at 74.55. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming
oversold warning bears that a corrective bounce is possible.

July unleaded gas was higher overnight due to light short covering as
it continues to consolidate below broken trendline support. Momentum
indicators are bearish but oversold hinging that a pause or
corrective bounce is possible near-term. If the decline resumes,
April's reaction low crossing at 85.40 is July's next target.

July Henry Hub natural gas was lower overnight in narrow trading as
it continues to consolidate above last week's low. Closes below this
support level would renew this year's decline while opening the door
for a possible test of the 62% retracement level of the 1999/2001
rally crossing at 3.64 later this month. Momentum indicators are
turning bearish once again signaling that additional weakness is
possible.

CURRENCIES

The September Euro is working on a possible inside day but was
slightly lower overnight as it continues to extend this week's narrow
trading range. Closes below 84.16 would renew this spring's decline.
Momentum indicators are neutral to bearish thereby leaving the door
open for additional weakness. It would take closes above this week's
high crossing at 85.85 to temper the near-term bearish outlook in the
euro.

The September British Pound plunged to a new 15-year low overnight
following the Labour Party's victory this week. This week's breakout
below long-term chart support crossing at 139.52 has opened the door
for a test of the February 1986 low at 136 later this spring.
Momentum indicators are bearish signaling sideways to lower prices
are possible near-term.

The September Swiss Franc was lower overnight as it extends its
decline following Wednesday's key reversal down. Closes into new lows
would set the stage for a possible test of weekly chart support
crossing at .5508 later this year. The ADX (a trend-following
indicator) remains in a bearish mode signaling that additional
weakness is still possible.

The September Canadian Dollar was higher overnight as it is
challenging the 62% retracement level of this year's decline crossing
at .6573. Multiple closes above this resistance level would confirm a
breakout thereby opening the door for a possible test of February's
gap, which begins at .6600. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling
that sideways to higher prices during the first half of June are
possible.

The September Japanese Yen turned lower overnight thereby ending
Thursday's corrective bounce. With a short-term top now in place, the
door is open for sideways to lower prices into mid-June as the
September yen is resuming this spring's trading range. Stochastics
and RSI have turned bearish signaling that additional weakness is
likely.

PRECIOUS METALS

August comex gold was higher in overnight trading as it continues to
extend the narrow trading range, which has formed around the 75%
retracement level of the decline off May's high crossing at 267.20.
Closes above 269.60 are needed to temper the near-term bearish
outlook in August gold. If the decline resumes, the reaction low
crossing at 263.20 is August's next target. Stochastics and RSI are
bearish but oversold warning bears not to press their hand as a low
may be near.

July silver was slightly higher in narrow trading overnight as it
consolidates above trading range support crossing at 4.31. Closes
below this support level crossing at 4.31 would open the door for a
possible test of weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month.
Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness
near-term is possible.

July copper plunged to new contract lows overnight thereby renewing
its decline off May's high and is challenging weekly support crossing
at 74.10. Closes below this support level could lead to a test of
weekly support crossing at 72.70 later this month. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are
still possible.

GRAINS

July corn was lower overnight due to light profit taking following
Thursday's low-range close. Uncertainties over extended weather
forecast and ideas that it's too early to push the panic button
despite declining crop conditions weighed on corn prices late
Thursday and in the overnight trade. I would not be surprised to see
additional profit taking during the day session, as traders are
unlikely to press the long side of the market ahead of the weekend.
Next Monday's crop conditions report will likely show another decline
in ratings due to this week's cool/wet weather across the Midwest. It
would take closes above Thursday's high at 2.01 1/2 to set the stage
for a test of May's high crossing at 2.11 1/2 later this month. Early
calls are for July corn to open a 1/2 to 1 cent lower this morning.

July wheat was fractionally higher in overnight trading due to
spillover support from Thursday's strong export sales and continued
hot/dry conditions across China. Additional support came from wet
conditions across portions of the Plains, which has slowed winter
wheat harvest. Wednesday's test of the contract low at 2.58 1/2 may
have also marked a double bottom. However, it will take closes above
last Friday's high at 2.72 before this is confirmed. Stochastics and
RSI are diverging and turning bullish hinting that a short-term
bottom may be in place. I am looking for an inside day as traders are
unlikely to take a major position ahead of the weekend. Early calls
are for July wheat to open steady to 3/4 of a cent higher this
morning.

SOYBEAN COMPEX

July soybeans were lower in overnight trading due to light profit
taking following Thursday's steady close. Uncertainties over the
extended weather forecasts for the Midwest leave the market
vulnerable to additional profit taking during the day session. The
cool/wet conditions that have dominated Midwest weather this week
should be reflected in next Monday's planting progress report. At the
same time, emergence concerns and slow crop development along with
continued strong demand should continue to underpin both old and
new-crop prices. Momentum indicators are bullish but nearing their
respective overbought zones warning bulls to use caution. Early calls
for July soybeans to open 2 to 2 3/4 cents lower this morning.

July soybean meal was also lower overnight due to light profit taking
following Thursday's spike above the 62% retracement level of this
winter's decline crossing at 169.40. Additional weakness during the
day session is needed to confirm Thursday's downside reversal, which
would then increase the odds that a short-term top might have been
posted. At the same time strong domestic and foreign demand along
with a tight cash market will continue to underpin the meal market
thereby limiting near-term downside risk. Early calls are for July
soybean meal to open a $1.00 to $1.10 lower this morning.

LIVESTOCK

August hogs closed modestly higher on Thursday due to improving
cutout values and spillover strength from bellies. Light fund and
cash connected buying also underpinned today's rally. Today also
marked the official start of the Goldman roll as they were selling
July and buying August. If the rally resumes, April's high crossing
at 65.95 is August's next target. Closes below last week's gap at
64.00 would strongly suggest that a short-term top has been posted.

August cattle extended this week's decline closing lower for the
fourth day in a row. However, a short covering bounce ahead of the
close tempered some of today's losses leading to a mid-range close. A
short covering bounce on Friday is possible as traders bank some of
this week's short profits. Momentum indicators have turned bearish
signaling sideways to lower prices into mid-June are possible.

FOOD & FIBER

July coffee closed lower on Thursday due to bearish short-term
weather forecasts for Brazil's coffee growing region. July remains
poised to test the late-May low crossing at 57.10. Closes below this
support level would renew this year's decline. However, momentum
indicators are oversold hinting that a short-term low is in place or
near. Closes above 60.80 are needed to temper the near-term bearish
outlook in the market.

July cocoa closed into new lows for the week thereby confirming the
recent breakout below this spring's trading range, which crosses at
955. Today's new low close for the month has renewed the decline off
May's high while setting the stage for a test of fib support crossing
at 862 later this month.

July sugar closed lower on Thursday thereby confirming yesterday's
key reversal down. Today's loss was enough to keep momentum
indicators bearish, as the stage is set for a possible test of last
week's low at 839. Closes below this support level would renew the
decline off May's high and open the door for a test of fib support
crossing at 832 then 808 later this month.

July cotton closed lower on Thursday as it continues to consolidate
above psychological support crossing at 40-cents. Closes above this
year's downtrend line crossing near 43.95 are needed to confirm a
bottom and trend change has taken place. Momentum indicators are
neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices near-term
are possible.

Another tidbit to remind us that we see/hear Divinity all around us: 

Just remember, ""Our God is an Awesome God!"" 

READ This All the Way, and send it back please! 
This will give you the chills.....GOOD Chills! 

A young man had been to Wed. night Bible Study. The pastor had shared
about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man
couldn't help but wonder, Does God still speak to people?"" 

After service, he went out with some friends for coffee 
and pie, and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked
about how God had led them in different ways.

It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home.
Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, ""God...If you still speak to
people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey."" 

As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest
thought to stop and buy a gallon of milk. He shook his head and said out
loud, ""God is that you?""  He didn't get a reply and started on toward
home. 

But again, the thought, buy a gallon of milk. The young man thought
about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how
little Samuel ran to Eli. ""Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy
the milk."" It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could
always use the milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and
started off toward home. 

As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, ""Turn down that
street."" This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection.
Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next
intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he
said out loud, ""Okay, God, I will."" 

He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop.
He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in a
semi-commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst
of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the
houses looked dark like the people were already in bed.

Again, he sensed something, ""Go and give the milk to the people in the
house across the street."" The young man looked at the house. It was dark
and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already
asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat.
""Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and, if I wake them up,
they are going to be mad and I will look stupid."" 

Again, he felt like he should go and give the milk. Finally, he opened
the door.   ""Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will
give them the milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I
want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something, but, if they
don't answer right away, I am out of here. 

He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise
inside. A man's voice yelled out, ""Who is it? What do you want?""   Then
the door opened before the young man could get away.    The man was
standing there in his jeans and t-shirt.  He looked like he just got out
of bed. He had a strange look on his face, and he didn't seem too happy
to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. ""What is it?"" The young
man thrust out the gallon of milk. ""Here I brought this to you."" 

The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway, speaking loudly in
Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward
the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was
crying. The man had tears streaming down his face. The man began
speaking and half-crying, ""We were just praying. We had some big bills
this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our
baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some
milk."" 

His wife in the kitchen yelled out, ""I ask him to send an Angel with
some. Are you an Angel?""

The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he
had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward
his car and the tears were streaming down his face.   He knew that God
still answers prayers. 

This is a simple test... 

If you believe that God is alive and well, send this to at least ten
people and the person that sent it to you!

1) The deals in these post ids are related to transport hedges that are 
captured in our transport model(not in ERMS).  If we were to officialize 
these post ids and report them on the VAR, we would then be only capturing 
half of the picture, since the transport model in our P&L is not in ERMS.  2)

parties.

Paul,

The A&M game was tragic.  My friend Tim and I went to watch it at a sports
bar and, needless to say, I was the only Aggie fan in the crowd.  We had a
chance to tie it or win it in the last two minutes.  We had driven the ball
from our own 9 yard line to about the CU 30 yard line.  We had a first down
and were going for it when we fumbled ($%&*!!) and they took it back for a
touchdown.  The waitress felt sorry for me and bought us a shot of I don't
even know what.  I'm headed to Texas in a couple of weeks to see the Aggies
Beat the Hell Outta Iowa State at Kyle Field.  I haven't been to Kyle Field
in ages so I'm really looking forward to it.

Petrogulf's agreement indicates they have access to all major delivery
points except Opal until the expansion is in place.  These other points
would include QGM, MGR, OTTCO and QPL.  It's a bit curious to me that they
would have QPL and OTTCO now since they have to go down the 20"" to get
there.  Seems like these would be in the same boat with the Opal option, so
maybe this is not a true, current option.  Can't Petrogulf tell you this
stuff?  It's not my place to do it, and the only reason I am is because
you're going to drop a large sum of money taking me out to dinner
(kidding!!).

As for dinner, yes I'm still available.  As for the place, don't feel like
you need to drop a bunch of cash (although cash is thrilling, isn't it??).
I'm happy eating just about anything.  I'm trying to be on a new health
kick, so healthy fare sounds appealing.  My only condition is that I can't
stay out late because I have a 5:30am appointment at the gym with my
trainer Thurs. am.  It's brutal.  I leave the house at 5am.  Want to stay
downtown or venture out?

to look at it fairly shortly, especially if you can give definitive

Do you feel that the commercial team is  finished with the exhibits?  I 
haven't worked on them, but I suspect the exhibits need work.  I know the 
bogey calc doc is a bit rough. [Rorschach, Reagan]  Exhibits are rough.  I 
need to make a list of Exhibits called out in the current doc version, pull 
them all together, and clean them up. 

Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff? [Rorschach, Reagan] 
  Yes.  I am not exactly sure of the context....but try this on for size:  
Clarksdale is subject to an Entergy transmission constraint that from time to 
time results in a transmission cut and mandates Clarksdale dispatching their 
generation assets to serve Clarksdale Native Load.  Dispatching Clarksdale 
assets under these circumstances is known as the first contingency must run 
condition.  During first contingency must run conditions, EPMI will document 
the production costs, megawatts generated, duration of the event, and lost 
opportunity cost of buying from the market.  Clarksdale is due reimbursement 
from Entergy for extra costs incurred during such events. 

Early next week is better than later, and Thursday and Friday are huge 
problem days for me.  When are you thinking of meeting with Beck?  Anyway to 
combine the two at once, given the short timeframe? [Rorschach, Reagan]  I 
think we could get everyone together at the same time as soon as Monday.  I 
want them to have the time to study the document so we can get it all done at 
once.  

Has Dave signed the extension, by the way? [Rorschach, Reagan]   done,

The deadline to submit a response is this afternoon at 5:00 pm with the understanding that a binding precedent agreement with termination outs needs to be executed by tomorrow afternoon (i.e. Thursday, November 29th).

I told Julie that I thought it was best if ENEL, rather than ENA, submitted the open season response and signed Tennessee's PA.  That way ENEL's RFP response would not get snarled up with any credit concerns that Tennessee had with the Enron Corp. announcements.  I told her that we were still an on-going concern and still wanted to sell gas to the project.  She appreciated our honesty and reaffirmed that ENEL was still interested in entering into a fuel supply arrangement with ENA.   

Also, I just received an announcement from Rio Bravo Pipeline that said that ""due to the CFE changing the date on which the bidders must present their Bid Proposals for the Rio Bravo IV Project from December 4, 2001 to December 11, 2001"" that the Rio Bravo Pipeline Open Season was also being pushed back to December 7, 2001.

originally submitted was okay, but he wants to review again - he had put it
on hold due to the securities entitlement account issue)

an hour or so, I'll have my secretary re-type it and will forward to you.
Unfortunately, this one is the other incumbency certificate which requires a

I have convinced Greg Lang that since the GE Consent and Agreement refers to
the fact that Salmon LLC has granted a security interest in the Turbine
Contract to the lenders, the GE Consent and Agreement should be executed by
Salmon after Pegasus is in control of Salmon.   Therefore, I have not

I suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and I 
will think about it this weekend.  I have a couple of ideas but I really want 
to mull it over.

They look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could you 
forward the draft change orders with it?

One point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have 
us refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money), 
retaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They are 
putting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and 
since the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be 
acceptable to GE.  

Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.  There are no calls

2.2 (d) Bank accounts/bookkeeping.  I've previously been advised that Corp 
performs this function.    Issues which arise: will the money be invested 
overnight, who has signature authority, etc.  We have a draft services 
agreement prepared for Peoples which can serve as a ""go by"" if you decide you 
need a separate doc.

2.2 (b)Billing/collection.  Responsibility generally should stop at sending 
nastygrams.  No duty to hire lawyers, etc.

2.2 (f) Insurance.  In Texas, you have to have licenses to buy/sell insurance 
and adjust claims.  Current language may be soft enough to not violate 
licensing laws.

2.2 (g) cost of filing for licenses and permits not included in defn of 
Marketing Expenses, but there's some catch all language that might help.

2.3  Accountants may like it to be clear that we can't hire/fire O & M 
contractor, set O & M policies, or dispatch plant.

3.2   If there are multiple transactions in a short period, these may be 
captured in one document, not one document for each transaction.

 It would be helpful if the EEIM for use with others explains our agency 
role. (may be in there - didn't review a copy) Is the Owner a power marketer 
yet?  Are we helping them get EEIM's with the Approved Counterparties, or are 
they on their own?

 Will Enron sign on behalf of Owner for Contractor (Enron) transactions 
(sounds silly)?  Is there an EEIM in the works between EPMI and Owner?  

3.3 (f) I suspect by now you've figured out profits, etc, relating to ""day 
of"" transactions.  

3.4  last line - should it be interruptible instead of contingent?  Assume 
Owner has transmission risk?

Is there a ""no third party beneficiary"" clause?  I might have missed it.  Not 
life or death.

Interesting structure.  Could I get a copy of the final document?

Thanks,

1759,"Here is what I have so far, I apologize for not sending these yesterday.

1)  Definitions - 

 Fuel Costs - Refers to ET Fuel costs.  I don't think this is defined 
anywhere, and in the TECO transaction this refers to existing gas supply 
contracts.  Reagan - Does MDEA   have any existing gas supply contracts?

 As a general comment, do we need to define the cost of serving their load 
through third party purchases? 

2)  Section 2 - Term

 Whose option is it to extend the term of this deal?  It sounds like both 
parties have the right to extend, but then later in the paragraph it states 
MDEA has the right to extend.  In the TECO agreement, TECO had a unilateral 
right to extend the contract for the first year.

3)  Section 8 - Accounting and Reports

 paragraph (c) refers to Existing Transactions - I thought we were taking 
this out.

4)  Section 10 - Delivery Point and Title

 Do we need to state where EPMI delivers to MDEA?

5)  Section 11 - Fuel Management Services

  It is my understanding that at the beginning of this agreement, ENA will 
'sleeve' the gas purchases, and the ultimate goal is to help MDEA set up 
master agreements with multiple parties.  However, my interpretation of the 
statement in para (a) ""The parties recognize that without MDEA's full and 
active participation....EPMI will not be able to procure fuel for the 
facilities or seek to reduce Fuel Costs,""  is that we will not be sleeving 
any gas purchases.  Is this the case?

6)  Section 13 - Payment and Fees

 It is my expectation that most months, we will be billing MDEA to pay our 
costs of serving their load, not redeeming to MDEA the Market Proceeds.  I 
think that para (a) is a little confusing because it mixes the two of these 
together.  I think it may be easier to understand if these two are broken out.

 Also, there will be times that we may have to sell off energy that we have 
overpurchased to serve their load.  We need to explicitly define how this 
will be handled.

Reagan - Here are a few comments about the exhibits:

1)  Exhibit [] - Reports

 I think I said this in my last e-mail, but the P&L, Risk Statement will not 
include 'various risk indicators for MDEA's power output for the term of this 
agreement' We may need to talk about this further.


2)  Exhibit XX - MDEA EPMI Incentive Fee Calculation

 Let's talk about this.

I'll let ya'll know if there is anything else!  

Thanks,

E

1760,"Tom -- Good point.  I am glad that you came to this conclusion.  The way the 
contract is written now provides that MDEA can do term deals on their own 
with third parties.  Our profit calcs are covered.  On the other hand, MDEA 
does not have the ability to do hourly and daily type deals with third 
parties.  We can talk about this aspect and I can give you the reasons for 
doing it this way.  In referring to the way the contract is written, take 
that comment with a grain of salt since we have not finished the contract,

As I preliminary answer, this language hasn't been approved by Deffner's 
group, although it is based on language they have seen before.  It was my 
understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen, as 
you didn't want them entering into the structuring picture until later.  We 
can ask for a blessing on the language, but that will probably lead to 
questions about how the deal will be structured, etc.  I am happy to access 
the resources in their group, however.

FCE hasn't seen any of this language.  It was something I pulled together for 
you to look at.

As for FCE's desire to assign in case of merger, etc, I think the language is 
too broad.  In fact, I think assignment by them should require our consent. 
Otherwise, it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring 
a bunch of stuff:  the know how, the patent rights, the manufacturing 
facilities, etc.  If they are going to merge with another company or sell 
their shares, they don't need an assignment clause, unless there is something 
peculiar in Conn. law.  They only need assignment language for an asset sale.

1838,"Hi guys,

In looking at CRRA's comments to the draft LOI. I have these questions:

1.  I'm not sure what we mean by EPC contract.  Is this referring to the Fuel 
Cell document we are working now, or is there to be another layer? I know 
this may depend on whether CRRA or someone else is doing the balance of the 
construction activities.

2.  He expects one EPC contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple 
contracts. Does anyone care?

3.  Does CRRA get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail 
the performance tests?  We have discussed with FCE the concept of a 
proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full 
reduction as to the failing unit(s) only.  Also, are we planning to mark up 
the fuel cell contract to recover our fee?  Is our fee at risk for the fuel 
cells failing to perform?

I agree with Rusty re: the put option complicating things for us.  Second, 
there has to be an absolute end to this agreement at some point. If we want 
to have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still needs 
to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter 
what.  In other words, if we want to add the language Rusty suggested, it 
should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement.  
We'll need to run this back through Accounting.

I really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5. If we add 
the language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back 
through Accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language.  

I don't know if Rusty and Fred think we may need a zoning change for this

I was kinda hoping for a post-graduation family  event on that Saturday, as 
hopes were raised when the ticket issue came up.  Doesn't sound like that's 
happening.   I don't know when we will be up that way, but it wouldn't

out of Houston on Friday will be horrific.  Neil and I haven't discussed any

Paige is supposed to intern with the Houston Aeros this summer.  No pay, 
which is a bad thing.  She is currently on the way to Colorado with some 
friends, and will be back a week from Sunday.  I haven't even mentioned Mac's 
graduation yet.  

I just finished a really busy time, and I'm optimistic that things will 
resume a more normal pace.  I hope to catch up on yard work this weekend, 
maybe clean out a closet.  I have the urge to purge.  

I would say the Katie got the Clarke math gene, but Paige is a math whiz.  It 
must be a recessive characteristic.  It is great that the girls have 
different arenas in which to excel.  

I sent Mom a table top cactus garden.  Hope it gets there.

at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: ""Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue.""
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.",Copp swain Franz Houston Ballet William atre Imp Karen Dacko Frederic Franklin Peter Farmer Anne Heaton Desmond Heeley Carl Cunningham,,"AZURIX ENRON Corporate Sponsors Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

1869,"All,

Herewith my attempt at summarizing comments and building a collective response from our conference call earlier this week.  Please review and comment asap.  I would like to start feeding responses into Tony Palmer and Murray Birch on Monday.

Paragraph 1
Enron aknowledges that releasing any and all potential claims against the ANNGTC Partnership is an important principle to adopt to secure commercial commitments from the Alaskan gas producers.  In principle, Enron is prepared to release claims for the accrued AFUDC component but is not prepared to release claims for the initial ~$300 MM because regulators may allow a mechanic to recover the earlier investments, which could present future upsides to the Withdrawn Partners.  Enron thus proposes to modify this principle to provide for the inclusion of the ~$300 MM investments, but specifically exclude the AFUDC component.  Ultimately, the toll for transport services will result through negotiations with the Producers, and their concerns can be addressed by expressly excluding surcharges/other regulatory mechanics approved by the regulators for the initial investments.

Paragraph 2

Paragraph 2a
Enron would like to change this principle to include an immediate cash payment equal to such Rejoining Partner's pro rata share of the lesser of-
i) US$10 MM and
ii) properly documented and audited costs incurred by TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills during the years 2000 and 2001

Paragraph 2b
Enron believes it is inappropriate for TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills to obtain a success payment/distribution equal to US$40 MM.  The parents of both companies will enjoy the benefit of increased revenues resulting from volume flows on B==>C segments owned by themselves, which should be a significant financial incentive.

Paragraph 3
Conform to comments outlined above in Paragraph 1.

Paragraph 4
A Rejoining Partner who subsequently withdraw should be allowed to recover its capital contributions without interest/AFUDC at some future date, preferably the first day of commercial operations.  New Percentage Interest will revert to all partners in proportion to their respective current percentage interests.

Paragraph 5
Enron would like to eliminate this principle.  It would be appropriate for change of control principles to be developed.

Paragraph 6
Ok.

Paragraph 7
Please clarify the principles in which the Partnership Agreement will be amended in order to ""modernize"" provisions for the management of the ANNGTC Partnership.

Paragraph 8
???

Paragraph 9
Ok.

Paragraph 10
Enron can not agree to the principles in a) and b)

Paragraph 11
Arguably, all the partners in ANNGTC would be capable of becoming the pipeline operator in Alaska.  The size of ANNGTC is such that it could hire its own pipeline operating management and staff in Alaska.  Enron believes it is inappropriate to appoint NAPC as the pipeline operator in Alaska and that it would be a straightforward exercise for ANNGTC to appoint an Operator by utilizing a competitive process amongst the Partners.

Paragraphs 12 and 13
Ok.

Paragraph 14
Enron proposes to eliminate the principle as stated and conform to the comments outlined above in Paragraph 4.

1886,"Our relocation to the new building is fast approaching and there are several 
important move related items that I would like to stress at this time.  I 
would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined 
below:

IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business 
unit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, 
would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June 
8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to 
visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of 
us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please 
contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.
New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.  
Any change requests that have already been received are currently being 
considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.
If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August 
3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their 
name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH 
7/25
Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed 
by Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related 
issues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for 
the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well 
informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.
Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we 
will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near 
future.
A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The 
Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.  
Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent 
phone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if 
you have any questions or issues related to phones.
All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and 
there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or 
people.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space 
available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow 
later):
1 Mega conference room
1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities
1 Large conference room - no videoconference 
3 Team rooms
File space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will 
be made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned 
file space as close to each individual group as possible.
At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not 
been resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues 
will be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new 
building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move 
date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries 
and distribution.
Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would 
appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to 
them via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday 
at 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make 
arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.
There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the 
new building.

I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of 
questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great 
and everything will work out in time.  Thank you for your cooperation and 
assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as 
possible.

Hello.  I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac 
impressionist lithograph.  I found them and purchased both from a gallery in 
London, William Weston.  They should be delivered this week.  They are 
beautiful and will add a lot to our collection.  By the way the Lichtenstein 
is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent.  I have 
also purchased an Appel in the last month.

I am interested in several artists.  Actually, a lot.  I will be looking for 
one or more of the following.  My concept is that overtime I would like to 
own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find 
something that we really like.  I listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my 
wife's favorites and priorities).  They are kind of in rank order but as I 
stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it.  I want signed 
and numbered.  I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an 
important fact in my buying decision.  I also realize that some may not have 
done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive.  For example, I 
would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper.  

At least that is what I am thinking now.

Bonnard (colorful only)
Lautrec
Suerat (any works on paper? - I don't know that he did any)
Other impressionist or post impressionist lithos
Braque
Moore
Arp
Rouault
Modrian
Rothko
Kline
Motherwell

By the way, I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso (although we have 2) 
that your gallery had a couple of years ago.  It was a cubist piece from the 
1920s and I believe you called the technique a ""push wa"" (pronunciation Vs an 
attempt at the proper spelling).  It was for sale in a couple of galleries in 
SF and was about $20,000.  Is there 1 available?  Also I am still thinking 
about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see, I have a lot of 
other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because 
we already have one.

Based on the latest information, EGM wants to be able to mark-to-market $20 
million on the GTL contract this quarter. To do so, we need GTL to sign and 
get final approval of a contract that does not have any contingencies or 
conditions precedent to its effectiveness. I will call Kevin Alexander to 
explain what EGM expects to have in place by the end of this month, and if 
necessary, I will go to London to work through the specific language. Based 
on the latest e-mail from Kevin, he thinks that the project must achieve 
financial close by June 30. This is not necessary and is obviously impossible.

In general, I will stick as closely as possible to the terms of the Marketing 
Agreement already signed and remove any project related contingencies. If EGM 
has the exclusive right to market GTL's methanol, then we should be able to 
mark some income. Then the discussions will focus on how much to reserve. If 
necessary, I will bring up a fixed offtake price for up to 300,000 metric 
tons per year, but I do not think it will be necessary. A prepay is 
definitely off the table. John, I believe that your preference is not to take 
any fixed price risk, rather to collect a fee for marketing methanol. This 
will be easier to get approved. Any contract with a fixed price will require 
sign-off from Bjorn.

After getting the proper contract to satisfy this month's needs for income, 
we will have to work hard to make the underlying project in Darwin feasible 
to avoid having to reverse the M-T-M income later. This will, at a minimum, 
require forcing Phillips to agree to a floating gas feedstock price and a 
settlement of the East Timor dispute with Australia for the gas. Note that 
this issue is a wild card and could kill the deal at any time.

Here are the very, rough numbers for what we can mark-to-market assuming a 
3.5% marketing fee, ten year contract starting in 2005, 1million tons per 
year, various average delivered methanol prices per ton, $500k per year of 
admin expenses to market methanol, a 20% credit reserve and no other reserves:
 Price   MTM Earnings

 $130   $18 million
  150     22 million
  170     25 million

Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed with getting GTL to sign and get 
approved by its board a MTM contract by the end of this month.

reason lies with the sale of cross shareholding interests (equity in other 
companies) and other assets.  The reality is that their operating profits

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.",Jeff Skilling Jeff,,Enron the Board of Directors Board

(1) Regarding OptionGrid, Samer can provide you a version that does not write out empty grids to the file by tomorrow.  He will then try to increase the max. number of grids from 95 to 320.  And we will write the file to a common drive that you can access from Windows, without having to FTP the file from the Unix to the NT drive.

I will check with my director (Zhiyong Wei) to see if we can move up the timeline for the OptionGrid running on Windows project.

(2) Regarding actual gamma: 

PriceDelta = Today's Mid. Price - Prior Day's Mid. Price

Actual delta     = Prior Day's (Option Library) delta * PriceDelta
Actual gamma = Prior Days' (Option Library) gamma * 0.5 * (PriceDelta * PriceDelta)

(3) Regarding the Asian model, the number of calendar days in a year is 365.25 for the new version using calendar days.
We have to merge the new version into the current production PortCalc that has the vol. skew changes.  We should have that in a couple of days. I will inform Errol when we are ready for him to start testing.

(4) Dave is looking into changing PortCalc to provide 2 actual Vegas - one without skew and one with skew.
From our preliminary analysis, it would require PortCalc, database and report changes to do this.
Would you also require 2 predictive Vegas and also sensitivities (i.e. +/- 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 % vol.) changes also?

Could you take a look at these two Option/Call deals that successfully 
bridged into Tagg( 750242/QK1859 & 750296/QK1897).  Also, take note that the 
swaps did not bridge into Tagg as requested ( 750297 & 750243), and will 
remain in failed status until further notice.  Everything looks great on our

One deal failed simply because John Arnold logged in as the buyer and acted

If you feel like drowning your sorrows at the end of the world in some free keg beer, sodas and hard liquor - come down to Clear Lake and celebrate the fact that today may be the last paycheck you receive from Enron.  Playstation, pool, and darts(with pictures of great Enron leaders) will be available for your enjoyment.  You can also try chase the 3 year old with the dirty diaper.  Party starts about 7 ish.  We will order Pizza or something like that if you haven't eaten.  Directions:

Attached are the files before the changes and after.  The changes made were to NGI-Socal and NGI/Chi. gate Index price for Sep-01 options.  The net change is -18,500.  I will take that PMA this month.  This change will nullify the need to take 4 PMAs on the current schedule:
1. Occidental: Deal QI6807.1
2. AEP: QI4559.1
3. Southern California: V40750.1, V53712.1
4. Virginia Power: QV7793.1, QY8669.1, V27240.1

b/c of these changes the total PMA I take this month will be +34,143 instead of +8343.

Thanks,

To:	Associate/Analyst Program Worldwide			
				
From:	Ken Lay	Department:	Office of the Chairman	
				
Subject:	Associate/Analyst Program	Date:	August 22, 2001	

As most of you know, Jeff Skilling created the Associate/Analyst Program in 1990.  This Program is one of his most successful and important contributions to Enron, and will continue as a cornerstone of the Company.  It remains our single most important source of new talent.

The purpose of this memo is to reassure you that the direction, philosophy, and importance of the Program remains unchanged.  As we have said many times, most of our new businesses were created by graduates and members of the Program.  Many of the current leaders of our company are also graduates of the Program.

Three broad principles will continue to guide the direction of the Program.
?	We will have only one Associate/Analyst Program at Enron, and it is a Company asset.
?	We will have a ""One Enron"" presence on campus to provide clarity of message and purpose.
?	The Program is rotational in nature, and will prepare our future leaders for success by providing exposure to Enron's network of people and systems.

The business prospects for Enron, and the opportunities for personal growth and development have never been better.  We also enjoy the deepest and broadest talent pool we have ever had.  Each and every one of you can be a key contributor to making Enron the World's Leading Company.

We have 10 MW of length from Sierra through the APX light load at $185.  Stan 
purchased this NP15 length from the APX and it should be scheduled DA by 
Jeremy.  There should be a ECTRT load zone in PGE3 with this length.  Use 
whatever opportunities are out there (dynegy across COB or a straight export) 
to maximize this position.  The deal numbers are: 581335-purchase from APX 
and 581356-desk to desk deal.  Please make sure this gets taken care of.

   Word of the Day for Sunday March 31, 2002:

   gravitas \GRAV-uh-tahs\, noun:
   High seriousness (as in a person's bearing or in the treatment
   of a subject).

     At  first sight the tall, stooped figure with the hawk-like
     features   and   bloodless  cheeks,  the  look  of  extreme
     gravitas,  seems  forbidding  and  austere, the abbot of an
     ascetic   order,  scion  of  an  imperial  family  who  has
     foresworn the world.
     --John  Lehmann,  ""T.S.  Eliot  Talks About Himself and the
     Drive to Create,"" [1]New York Times, November 9, 1953

     And  we want to tell our readers about sharp, clever books,
     utterly lacking in gravitas, that we know will delight them
     on the beach or the bus.
     --Benjamin  Schwarz,  ""(Some  of)  the best books of 2001,""
     [2]The Atlantic, December 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Gravitas is from the Latin gravitas, ""heaviness, seriousness,""
   from gravis, ""heavy, serious.""

According to Jaime, we have no formal netting agreement nor have we ever netted in the past.  MGI assumed that once they paid the 3.9 we would pay the 3.1.  We did not.  Post-petition payment but pre-petition contract.  We do not have a master, and I assume we confirmed using GTCs; Jaime did indicate that the volumes were comprised of several deals.  He wants to know if he is going to get paid.  I did not want to comment and told him that I would pass to you and gave him your name.  Does he have a pre-petition or administrative claim?  He spoke to someone in settlements and told me that person (did not have name) indicated they could not pay him because of the bankruptcy. Jamie's number is below.

There are a number of things that have come up on which I hope to get your assistance, concerning both Dow wells 13 and 14 and the land sale to Texas Brine.

Starting with Dow, I have written a (very rough!) draft reply to Gary Chapman's letter of October 2 regarding a new amendment to the Brine Services Agreement.  
We still would like them to buy the pad gas, but, given the equipment purchases needed if we do have to remove the pad gas, we have to have a concrete deadline for whether they will buy the gas (Dec. 14).  Even so, in talking to Dave Owen it seems to me that the equipment may not be installed for rebrining by the time we exit the wells.  How do we handle that type of delay contractually?  
Dave Owen has told Dow that we are not interested in allowing the fresh water option that Dow suggested in their letter, so I did not even address it here.  I think they understand that we want no part of that. 
Perhaps we can discuss these and other issues after you've read the draft.  

 
As for the Texas Brine land sale, 
Jean has asked me to draw up a timeline to close.  I have spoken to the Texas Brine folks, and unless something goes really wrong with their environmental analysis,  we all expect this to close by the end of November.  The timeline reflects this, but I would like you to take a quick look and see if I am missing anything, as there really are not that many steps.  
TB has not gotten back to us on the draft sale document, but I'm hoping to get it soon.   
There has been a bit of delay as they have requested access to any environmental assessments we have done on the land.  All the channels I have pursued tell me there has never been anything done by Enron (per Kyle Purvis).  If you know anything about this, please let me know!
Do you have a draft of the easement agreement (?) for the March land sale?  I don't have alot of details about location etc, but I think I could find them out if necessary.  Perhaps while we are waiting for a reply on the sale doc we can hammer out the language for the easements on that and on the new land sale.

 
I think that's it for now, have a great weekend and please let me know if you have time to talk early next week.  Thanks!  Eva",Gerald Gary Chapman's Dave Owen rebrining Jean Kyle Purvis,,Dow Texas Brine the Brine Services Agreement Enron

I want to provide you with an update on current events and their potential effects on members of the Program.

As the business units make decisions about the future course of the company, members of the Program will be affected.  Where positions are eliminated, individuals are being given consideration for other opportunities available within Enron.  Any information communicated to you regarding elimination of your position by the business units will have been coordinated with the Program in advance, and will be definitive.

I know how anxious and frustrating these times are for everyone - they are for my team as well.  The most accurate and timely internal source of information will be communication from the Enron Corp Office of the Chairman.

At this point, no one is certain what the future may bring regarding our careers at Enron.  I do know for certain that each of you is here, because you were selected from ""the very best of the best"".  I appreciate your continuing patience and efforts.

o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.",,$1 billion $4 billion,JPMorgan Salomon Smith Barney Our Northern Natural Gas Company Transwestern Pipeline Company Our Board of Directors the Board - William Powers The University of Texas School of Law Special Committee Dean Powers Enron The Securities & Exchange Commission SEC Moody's Baa1 BBB EnronOnline EES Home Depot Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's

2132,"Per our conversation, BGE is implementing a fee (eff. 7/1/02) referenced in the BGE Electricity Supplier Manual (pg. 32) , as follows:

	""Charges for Coordination Services provided under this Tariff and Supplier Coordination Agreement""


The fee will be invoiced to us monthly, and is distinguishable from the forecasting and scheduling services the desk provides, and for which .25 per MWh has been included in your deal costs.  BGE defines the Scheduling Coordinator as:

""An entity recognized the the PJM OI and qualified to act on behalf of the Electricity Supplier in taking such actions with PJM as are necessary in order for Electricity Supplier's obligations as defined in this Tariff to be met, including the submission of energy schedules to the PJM OI. and that either is (1) a member of the PJM interconnection, L.L.C., or (2) the PJM-approved agent for scheduling purposes, of one or more Electricity Suppliers that are members of the PJM Interconnection, L.L.C.""


Per Schedule 1 in the same document, the fee will be:

	""$30/MW/month...Based on the average daily Electricity Supplier's MW peak load contribution for the month""

This calculates to approximately .063 per MWh based on an assumed 65% load factor (.041 at 100% load).


Although the BGE TC for the Index product (Page 1, PRICE, Bullet 2.) specifies that the customer will be responsible to pay or reimburse us for all ""Special Utility Charges"" as further defined in the Master Agreement, this is going to be a recurring, ongoing charge rather than a special charge.

We therefore believe that this charge is more appropriately a component of the EESI Energy Price as defined in the TC, and recommend that the definition be modified to include the BGE Coordination Services Charge as defined in the BGE Electricity Supplier Manual.  This charge would then be allocated to the customers based on total monthly load (as are several of the ISO charges).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks-

2154,"Hello,

As you know, this week I met with S&P on Wednesday and Moody's on Thursday.  
S&P had three people there including Peter Rigby and William Chew (MD 
infrastructure finance) and Moody's had eight people there including Susan 
Abbot (MD corp. finance, power group).  I thought the meetings went very 
well.  There was an active dialogue during both presentations and a lot of 
questions were asked.  The stated objective for both meetings was that Enron 
has gone as far as we can with our product development working in a vacuum, 
and that we feel we have developed a structure that covers the dominant 
outstanding risk that merchant generators are exposed to (market prices), and 
that we think this is enough to achieve an investment grade rating, but if 
not then what more do we need.  Both gave me no commitments but promised to 
give me preliminary feedback next week.

We e-mailed copies of the presentation to both of you yesterday.

I suggest a conference call between Enron, Linda and Tom...maybe Tuesday next 
week to discuss the rating agency meetings in more detail and to discuss 
where we are in product and project development.

The lawyers are continuing to refine and discuss my proposed structure.  Key 
issues seem to be potential treatment of my two contract structure in 
bankruptcy and whether or not my contracts are considered insurance.  I will 
keep you posted as we go.

Let me know what times are good for you.

Great to hear from you.  Early congrats on your graduation.  Everything has 
been
going well down in the Lone Star State.  I got married in September down the 
Jersey
shore and everything has been going well.  We bought a house back in May.  It 
needs
an incredible amount of work.  We own the ugliest house on the block, by far.

How are things in Indiana?  Are you and Paul still together?  How is he 
doing?  When
is the last time you were back in Jersey?  We went back over Christmas but 
only for
a couple days.  I think next year we'll go back during New Year's instead of 
Christmas.
If you ever get near Texas or pass through Houston, please give us a call.  
You both

I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to get 
crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that is in cash.
The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase in
plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates but there'll
be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've just seen the beginning.  
I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.

Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis is not a short term
problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that state's economy goodbye.
Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate prices in the country, and 
(2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst of a hi-tech meltdown, what would
keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  If you own any
CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply.
Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue likely won't be solved anytime
soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so high that
the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cutting
back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours.  California will see
this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses have
closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the blackouts will get much worse.
If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas, I would bet it will go
bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy 
of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keep my eyes on
the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care and thanks for the email.

2221,"Hi Carol

How about Wed, the 8th?",Carol,,
2222,"Elizabeth, 
Carol and I had a  conversation (with Justin Boose mostly listening in) about 
how best to coordinate her much welcomed support for West Desk EEI deals and 
out of that conversation I would like to propose that we send the following 
message to Tim and the Mid-Marketers.  The message is designed to enforce a 
kind of teamwork discipline and approach to EEI work that Steve, Justin and 
me have been developing here.  Obviously the message will not be sent until 
you and Carol are happy with it, and my suggestion is that you, Elizabeth, 
should send the message.  

Mid-Marketers:
The legal team supporting West Desk Trading has been strengthened by the 
addition of Carol St. Clair of ENA's Houston legal department.  Carol is 
going to concentrate on negotiating high priority EEI Agreements.  We are 
trying to build an improved process  for supporting EEI negotiations that 
involves a teamwork approach among a team of lawyers working together  along 
the following lines.  The idea is to create a steady processing of all EEI 
agreements at one level,  while at the same time,  having the flexibility to 
keep our most experienced trading attorneys working on our highest EEI 
priorities at any given time. The highest priority EEI agreements will be 
those where we are trying to get new, long term business. 

Justin Boose of Stoel Rives will have the responsibility to drive Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 of the EEI process. 

Stage 1 is all internal steps required to send a Cover Sheet including credit 
terms to the Counterparty.  These steps will involve getting the credit work 
sheet from Credit to our paralegal, Genia Fitzgerald and getting the Cover 
Sheet including the credit terms from Genia, proofreading it and identifying 
who to send it to.  

Stage 2 is harassing the Counterparty and, in cooperation with Mid-Marketers, 
getting the right people from the CP  to look at our Cover Sheet and reply 
with comments.  

Christian and Carol will be primarily responsible for Stage 3 of the EEI 
process, with Steve Hall also involved in this stage from time to time as 
other priorities may permit.  

Stage 3 is driving  the negotiations from the completion of Stage 2 to 
closing. 

Pat Boyston will be asked to join Stage 3 to help address all muni issues and 
to close out other issues as well from time to time.  Eventually Justin will 
grow into providing Stage 3 support. 

The critical credit liaison function will be made by the responsible attorney 
as the process moves to completion, with Legal taking the responsibility to 
drive the overall process to completion. 

We believe this kind of disciplined approach by this team should provide an 
enhanced level of support for EEI negotiations day in and day out if 
everybody recognizes   who is expected to do what during the three Stages. 
Christian has the responsibility to see that either he or Carol or Steve are 
concentrating on the highest priority EEI negotiations at any given time. 

Support for EEI negotiations is only part of the legal work that must be done 
for the West Desk and prioritizing the other work will be handled by 
Christian and Steve, working with me in Houston.

2226,"Elizabeth:

We followed up on our discussions last week regarding the consequences of a 
possible bankruptcy of a municipal counterparty and our ability to terminate 
and liquidate our positions in such event, without regard to the generally 
applicable automatic stay.  Attached is a brief memo discussing this issue.  
The principal points to note are as follows:

(1) Municipalities, if they were to file for bankruptcy, do so under Chapter 
9 of the Bankruptcy Code (""BC"")--e.g., Orange County, CA.

(2) The ""forward contract"" exception to the automatic stay found in Sec. 556 
of the BC presently is not explicitly made applicable to filings pursuant to 
Chapter 9.  As you recall, Sec. 556 allows termination of a forward contract 
because of the commencement of a bankruptcy case notwithstanding the general 
prohibition for termination of executory contracts for such grounds in Sec. 
365.  This appears to have been an oversight when Sec. 556 was added to the 
BC in 1982 (according to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission) and 
probably has not been a ""high on the agenda item"" to correct due to the fact 
that Chapter 9 bankruptcies are relatively rare.

(3) It appears that the other amendments to the BC dealing with forward 
contracts are applicable to Chapter 9, such as Sec. 362 (b) (6) which allows 
the non-defaulting party to setoff or settle without regards to the stay if 
there is an existing default other than an insolvency event.  Also note that 
Colliers on Bankruptcy, the ""Bible"" in this area, suggests that one can 
nonetheless make the argument that the forward contract exception can be read 
to apply to Chapter 9 filings under present law (see also the discussion at 
(6) below)--although it is uncertain whether a bankruptcy court would accept 
this argument to effectively write something into the statute.

(4) There currently is pending legislation that has been passed by both the 
House and the Senate (and is now the subject of a joint House/Senate 
Conference Committee) that would make it clear that the forward contract 
exception to the automatic stay shall apply to Chapter 9 bankruptcies.  
Adding Sec. 556 to Sec. 901 (the section delineating which sections are 
applicable to Chapter 9 bankruptcies) is not controversial and should survive 
the joint conference committee since similar provisions exist in both the 
House and Senate bills. These provisions are part of the overall legislation 
making fundamental changes in the BC (that has received a lot of press and 
which is controversial in terms of how it treats individual consumers filing 
for bankruptcy).  Our sense, however, is that the bill will be passed and 
signed by President Bush.

(5) Assuming the amendments to Chapter 9 filings are enacted, under the 
existing bills they would first become effective for bankruptcy cases filed 
after 180 days after the legislation is signed by the President.  Thus, to 
the extent that ENA has existing contracts with municipalities, ENA would be 
permitted to exercise its termination and liquidation rights thereunder 
without regard to the automatic stay as long as the municipal counter party 
does not file within 6 months after the date the legislation is signed.

(6) It is worth noting that the legislative committee reports describing the 
changes provide that Congress is ""clarifying"" that the forward contract 
provisions of the BC apply to municipal bankruptcies, noting that these 
provisions ""by their terms are intended to apply to all proceedings under 
Title 11"" (which includes Chapter 9 proceedings).  The Senate Report  goes on 
to say that:  ""Although sections...556...provide that they apply in any 
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, this subsection makes a technical 
amendment in chapter 9 to clarify the applicability of these provisions.""  
(Emphasis added).  Thus, this committee language would appear to support an 
argument that Sec. 556 applies to Chapter 9 bankruptcies under Congress's 
interpretation of existing law--obviously, the hoped for result from ENA's 
standpoint.

(7) For your information, when Orange County, CA, filed for bankruptcy the 
County filed under Chapter 9.  The investment pool that held the derivatives 
and other financial contracts initially also made a separate filing under 
Chapter 9. This filing was dismissed, essentially on the basis the investment 
pool was not eligible for relief under Chapter 9 because it did not qualify 
as a ""municipality"" and it had not been specifically authorized to file under 
Chapter 9.  The dealers and brokerage houses terminated and liquidated their 
positions shortly after the initial filing, based on their belief that the 
investment pool's use of Chapter 9 was improper.  Their terminations and 
liquidations were not undone.

(8) Lastly, as mentioned above, you should note that even if Sec. 556 is not 
applicable to Chapter 9 filings under existing law, if ENA terminated a power 
contract with a municipality prior to the filing date for a reason other than 
the act of filing a bankruptcy petition (e.g., a bond downgrade; failure to 
post collateral; a cross default; the existence of a condition where the 
counterparty is ""unable to pay its debts as they come due,"" etc.), ENA would 
be permitted to proceed with the liquidation of its position (and it could 
exercise any set off or settlement rights) without regard to the automatic 
stay.

Hopefully, the pending legislation will be passed and the concern as to the 
applicability of Sec. 556 to municipalities will be completely eliminated 
within a relatively short period of time.  In the interim, particularly 
during the upcoming summer (when prices in many locations will be highly 
volatile and certain parties' credit positions could fluctuate rapidly and 
materially in some cases, particularly if they are filling open positions in 
the spot market), it may make sense to alert our credit group to be 
particularly vigilant in their monitoring of the ongoing financial condition 
of our municipal counterparties so that we preserve as much flexibility as 
possible with respect to exercising our termination rights under the 
contracts on account of defaults other than the filing of a bankruptcy 
petition by or against our counterparty.

Please give me (or Carl, 303 291-2630, or Jim, 303 291-2632) a call if you 
want to follow up on any of this.

Thanks.

John

You are invited to attend the 3rd Annual Urban Business Initiative Volunteer
Kickoff on Wednesday, September 26, 2001 at Slainte Irish Pub (509 Main
Street) at 6:00 p.m.

The Urban Business Initiative is a group of young professional volunteers
who are committed to the economic revitalization of Houston's inner city.
UBI was founded by a group of Enron analysts in 1996, and has since grown to
include volunteers from more than 15 corporations in Houston.

UBI volunteers work on consulting teams with small business owners and
entrepreneurs in Houston's inner city on projects such as developing
business and marketing plans, conducting financial analyses, and providing
technology assessments.  They also develop and conduct business education
seminars to promote business literacy in Houston.

Please join us if you would like to learn more about the Urban Business
Initiative and the impact we are having on Houston's inner-city businesses.

Sincerely,
Mary Messick

The group is a mixture of local citizens from the civic improvement, business, and environmental communities who would like to improve the fundamental health and economics of the city to be more competitive with other cities.  At the meeting, the president will more specifically discuss the plan for Houston as well as volunteer opportunities for interested and experienced professionals.

Richard,

How does this look?  If I can get a few minutes with Mark H. today, I'm going 
to propose that I speak to Stan Klimberg about getting this signed before 
Thursday's meeting with LIPA.  Thanks for your help this morning.

2262,"High-level meetings took place between officials of the Clinto 
Administration, Governor Davis and other parties on Tuesday night (Ken Lay 
and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron). The parties agreed to continue the CA 
talks at Treasury and to suspend the FERC process.  The FERC chief judge and 
FERC staff attended the meetings at Treasury on Wednesday.  The Tuesday 
meeting is called the meeting of ""principals.""

Apparent   Process
Tuesday meeting gave two assignments to us.  
 (1)  Develop framework for auction for long-term contracts and resolving QF 
issues
 (2)  Develop framework for dealing with utility debt, including supplier 
""forbearance""

Long-term contracts--Attended by Sue Mara
 -- After much debate, divided into three subgroups:
  (a) Timeline/Implementation
  (b) Utility Needs/Product definition/RFP development
  (c) Standard Contract Development
 -- Timeline -- I was the lead and we completed our assignment.  We agreed on 
an aggressive schedule   with power flowing by 2/1/01.  The process is set up 
for DWR, working with a consultant.  It's an   RFP rather than an auction 
process. The idea of a  mock auction was rejected.
 --  Product definition -- Much work needed here.  Major issue set forth 
below.
 -- Contract -- Most parties (including Enron) want to use the EEI standard 
contract.  Group working on   additional provisions.  Plan final contract by 
Friday.
Utility Debt -- Attended by Sarah Novosel
 -- Report later

Major Issues from Long-Term Contracts

NEW MAJOR ISSUE:  Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they want the 
State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that this had 
been their idea all along.  In their view, the utilities provide a forecast 
and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of the 
utilities.  They were unwilling to commit to any time frame.
Kind of Auction or RFP -- a.k.a What does the Governor really want?  Many 
people in the room believe that the Governor was firm in his demand for 5.5 
cent power for ALL the unmet load of the utilities.  We spent four hours 
debating these issues.  In the end, the parties felt that the best approach 
would be to have simulataneous auctions as follows:
 -- Separate bids for NP 15 and SP 15
 -- RFP 1 -- Suppliers submit bids for more than one product with a blended 
price of 5.5 cents.
 -- RFP 2 -- (Considered closest to the Gov's proposal) State sets price of 
5.5 cents and suppliers compete    on term and volume.
 --RFP3 -- Suppliers provide bids for any of the utilities' product needs and 
are free to bid any price,    volume or term.
 -- All RFPs would be conducted simultaneously.  Parties agree that RFP3 is 
most likely to get the
   greatest number of bids.
  
Next Steps
Meetings continue on Thursday
Plan is to have final documents ready for the next meeting of the principals

2265,"Hi Cliff,
Attached is a memo from Doak Bishop analyzing Enron's claims under our 
political risk insurance for expropriation of TGS resulting from the stamp 
tax.  We are asserting in our suit against Argentina, that the tax assessment 
is an expropriation prior to payment because it affects our equity in the 
company.  In other words, any attempt to dispose of the asset would require 
disclosure of this massive assessment which significantly impairs the value.  
Doak and I met with our expert in international law, Professor Michael 
Reisman of Yale who believes and will testify that this is a valid claim.  
Therefore under the policy, we arguably have an immediate claim for 
expropriation against OPIC, even though we haven't paid any money. To avoid 
waiving any claims, we will prepare a letter to OPIC requesting a tolling 
agreement, so we do not have to file a claim or arbitration against it within 
the period required under the policy, pending resolution of the matter.  
Given the nature of our call with them this morning, I'm sure they will 
cooperate.

I will arrange a call with Guido Tawil, our local counsel in Argentina to 
review the PPI issue, and we will analyze the commercial policy to see if we 
can find any coverage there.
Kind regards,
Michelle

June 10, 2001

Lynch was appointed March 22, 2000. Previously she was director of Gov. Gray 
Davis' Office of Planning and Research.
Question: What is this summer going to be like in terms of blackouts? What is 
the economic impact going to be?

Answer: I don't think anybody can predict. They are wild guesses or at least 
estimates based on assumptions that we don't know. Three factors influence 
the level of blackouts. One is how hot it's going to be. The second is 
conservation and whether folks will really step up to the plate, both 
business and residences, and conserve their hearts out and load shift to 
non-peak times. We reduced the load 8 to 9 percent in March and April and 
slightly more (11 percent) in May. We're going to have to do better than that 
to avoid blackouts.

The third factor is making sure that the generation that can run does run and 
right now we're doing an abysmal job of that. We have record levels of 
unplanned outages at generating plants. This week 10,000 megawatts were out 
of 35,000 megawatts (42,000 megawatts including municipal utilities) in state 
capacity. Historically, there has only been 3,000 to 4,000 megawatts off at 
any one time.

Does the PUC have no control over when utilities take a plant off line?

Utilities yes, private generators no. Since November the unplanned outages 
have been three, four times what history would show over a 20-year period. 
Exactly what explains that is the heart of one of our investigations.

What can the PUC do about it?

We have been in the plants since mid-January. In January we had 25 days of 
stage 2 alerts, two days of stage 3 in 31 days. We started going in those 
plants although we've had lots of difficulty getting into plants on time and 
most importantly getting the operations and maintenance logs.

Why don't you get an injunction from a judge to tell the private companies 
they have to give the PUC everything it wants?

Frankly, because in this last 100-day period I was trying to not be that 
aggressive, I was trying to work it out with these generators. And we have 
made significant movement with some of those generators.

Is it illegal for a privately owned power company to shut down in order to 
drive up prices?

Isn't that the multibillion dollar question? That's where you match you legal 
theories.

Is the PUC joining in any of these legal actions against FERC and the private 
power generators?

You know we actually asked for help from FERC in getting data from generators 
because FERC has wide access to all sorts of market data. I talked to (former 
chairman James) Hoecker directly in September. He said, 'No problem. You just 
send us your data request and we'll make sure they comply.' But we had no 
informal help from the FERC and so we filed a motion, in November, I believe, 
for FERC to compel those people under its jurisdiction to give us basic 
documents. FERC has yet to move on those motions to compel.

Is the PUC is joining in any of the civil actions?

At this point we haven't joined in the private civil lawsuits.

What else can the PUC do?

Well there's a ton of stuff that the PUC does in front of FERC. We appear on 
electricity and natural gas issues and we continue to file formal complaints 
to that administrative agency. For instance, it was the PUC that brought the 
complaint at FERC against El Paso Corp., three weeks after I became president 
of the PUC. We complained about anti-competitive activity. We have brought 
all the motions at FERC to prevent the generators from re-upping their market 
price authority.

If FERC does nothing and allows this market-based rate authority to continue, 
what would you do?

California is experiencing the real time consequences of justice delayed is 
justice denied. Eventually the administrative procedure act would allow us to 
go to court but frankly a variety of utilities and other folks have been 
trying to kick it up to either the D.C. Circuit or the 9th Circuit. 
Preliminary responses from the courts have been that they have failed to 
exhaust administrative remedies.

What's in store for San Diego in terms of price hikes?

Bottom line, it's unrealistic to think that San Diego can continue to be 
charged in the 6 to 7 cent range when everybody else now is being charged in 
the 10 to 11 cent range. But I can't prejudge the level because we're just 
starting to hear the evidence.

How do you think the escrow accounts -- 'our individual charge accounts with 
SDG&E' -- are going to shake down eventually?

Frankly, that's an issue that's also before the commission. What the 
legislation clearly says is that there's this balancing account that San 
Diego is billing things into as a regulatory accounting matter but that's not 
the end of the inquiry. They put the money in and they charge it to a 
regulatory account and then they come to the PUC. Then the PUC judges the 
reasonableness of those charges. And the separate watch dog component of the 
PUC, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, has done some preliminary analysis on 
SDG&E's charges up through I believe August of 2000 and has questioned a 
large percentage of those charges as unreasonable because of SDG&E's failure 
to hedge when they had hedging opportunities.

Utility executives criticize the PUC on two major counts. They say only half 
the utility plants had to be divested but the PUC set the rate of return and 
other restrictions in such a fashion that it really encouraged utilities to 
dispose of the other half. Second, they say that when the PUC eventually 
allowed them to enter long-term contracts, it did not spell out procedures in 
case the contracts turned out to be unfortunate moves. How would you respond?

The first part wasn't on my watch in terms of the rate of return. That was 
set by the prior PUC. However on that question of rate of return and 50 
percent versus more I think SDG&E is a little separately situated because I 
do think there were some encouragement of SDG&E selling off in order to be 
able to merge. The rate of return may have been lower than the utilities 
wanted . . .

And the criticism about long-term contracts?

I think the long-term contract issue has been painted in simplistic terms and 
it's not a simplistic question. When the utilities came to the commission in 
2000 seeking permission the commission acted faster than it usually acts. On 
July 21 of last year PG&E and Edison came to the commission and said they 
wanted authority to enter into direct bilateral contracts. By Aug. 3 we said 
yes.

But they claim that you did not give them the ground rules.

Oh, we certainly did. We applied the historic reasonableness test. But they 
wanted an up-front guarantee that they would not be second-guessed and my 
concern on that was heightened because they have all these unregulated 
subsidiaries. Because they're now energy trading in the market . . . The 
facts are they did enter contracts and we can show you the contracts they 
entered into in August, September, October and November of last year.

When California's deregulation law was being shaped, why was nobody concerned 
about abuse of market power by the private generating companies?

It is truly astonishing and I believe it's because of an ideological bias 
from my predecessors who said, 'Well, we will have a flood of competition 
into this market because it's just a commodity.' But, in fact, this commodity 
is uniquely situated to not have a flood of competition because you have high 
capital barriers to entry. You have long lead times to increase supply. It's 
a fundamental economic necessity which can't be stored and you can't choose 
not to buy it, there's no effective substitute.

Other states such as Texas and Pennsylvania appear to be doing deregulation 
right. Do you believe it can be done right?

I think the jury's out on that question. Texas started from a position of 
supply and is energy independent and does not report to the FERC in terms of 
its own intrastate transmission grid. Pennsylvania already had an integrated 
utility sharing relationship with other states. The utilities had buy-back 
contracts with the plants that they sold so that they got long-term contracts 
at the time of sale. The utilities also sold a much smaller percentage of 
their plants. I say California went the farthest fastest with the least 
amount of safeguards.

In retrospect, what was the central flaw in this deregulation plan?

The central flaw was not to realize the market power would be exercised by 
the sellers of a fundamental economic necessity for which there is no 
effective substitute.

In the current argument over temporary price caps, the Bush administration 
says this might diminish short-term pain but in the long term would 
discourage new supply. What's your reaction to that?

My reaction is price caps or cost-based pricing is an absolute economic 
necessity for California. The market is broken. Regardless of who broke it 
and how it broke, it's broken, maybe irrevocably. Until we can make a market 
work here we must have some protection for our economy. We really are going 
back a hundred years and reaching back, these companies are re-creating the 
kinds of trust that led to trust busting.

The economy can't withstand this and in terms of the supply argument, yeah 
supply is a state issue. Gov. Davis is streamlining and we have all these 
plants being built and plus we are conserving like never before. We have 
supply coming on line, it's being built, it's not being abandoned and if it 
were abandoned in the unlikely event the people that sunk in hundreds of 
millions of dollars into an investment decided to walk and abandon their 
investment, which isn't rational economic behavior, then the utilities could 
take those over and build it at cost-based building or the power authority or 
whoever. Most of those plants entered the permitting process when the price 
cap was $250 a megawatt.

Talking about rational behavior, it's certainly in the political and economic 
interest of the Bush administration not to see California's economy go in the 
tank, not to see the economy of the whole West Coast be hammered and suffer 
accordingly. If you presume rational behavior on their part, you'd have to 
presume that they're doing what they think is the right thing.

But once again it's a question of are you going to stand on your ideology 
regardless of all facts to the contrary or are you going to try and fix given 
the actual facts that are at play in that market? I think even the most 
committed free market person, if they're principled, recognizes that you need 
a market cop in any market. This market's being gamed in a myriad of ways.

Are you getting anywhere with the FERC in making the arguments that you're 
stating here?

The question right now is who is the FERC? I have not met formally with the 
two new FERC commissioners since they've been confirmed which just occurred 
last week. I look forward to a transition period where the FERC gets off its 
ideology and gets back to practicality and doing its job as a regulator.

Will that happen as long as George Bush and Dick Cheney are saying quite the 
opposite?

California needs to do what it needs to do to protect itself, but I do think 
we may have an opportunity in transition. We can't count on it, but we 
shouldn't close the door to it.

The new electricity plants coming on line for the most part are natural 
gas-fired. Would we still be in a crunch if natural gas prices remain high?

The PUC has been doing everything it possibly can in the last two months and 
will continue to do it in the next several months to encourage utilities to 
add natural gas infrastructure. The other thing is they have to inject 
natural gas into storage right now, even though we know that the price of 
natural gas is too high. California is being gouged on natural gas.

Isn't everybody else being gouged on natural gas prices?

No, God no. Prices at the California border are two to three times higher 
than anyplace else in the country. The problem here is the El Paso line is 
the market maker for the price of gas coming in to California because of 
anti-competitive behavior which I believe was intentional to raise prices. 
That evidence is being heard at the FERC right now.

Are you expecting anything from that administrative law judge at FERC?

We have to be hopeful. The astonishing thing here is that we, California, 
cannot count on the federal government to do its job.

2283,"Gentlemen:

1.  I have spoken with David Best about the difficulty Paul Henking has 
encountered so far with getting any agreement from Mitsubishi to delay both 
the joint survey/testing and arbitration in hopes of a settlement.  As I 
understand Paul's suggestion, Paul wants to switch fronts and press our cargo 
underwriters to pay us off and handle the arbitration themselves (Paul, if I 
have misstated your strategy, please let me know).  I understand from Paul's 
e-mail that he does not think Mitsubishi will settle prior to arbitration and 
joint testing.

Unfortunately, while we want to consider all options, neither David nor I 
think that this approach will succeed.  We believe that our cargo 
underwriter's response to our claim will be that they, too, want us to 
proceed with the joint testing before they will consider paying anything on 
this claim.  We should also all recall that ECT performed a pre-sale survey 
of product from the same location that was off-spec.  Although we do not 
think that either Mitsubishi or the cargo underwriters are yet aware of that 
survey, such a survey would seem to raise an inherent vice issue in both 
proceedings.  Last, until at least the joint testing has been done, I think 
that the cargo underwriters would require us to act as a prudent uninsured; 
i.e., to name an arbitrator and vigorously litigate our claims.

Of particular note, Steve Jones, our expert chemist, has notified us that the 
samples taken for joint testing have a shelf-life that may be coming to an 
end in the near future.  If the samples begin to ""turn"" before the joint 
testing has taken place, the delay of the testing could be used against us in 
the arbitration.  Parenthetically, it also appears that a representative of 
the shipowner's P&I club wants to be involved in the testing.  It may be that 
Mitsubishi, as the vessel's charterer, has placed the head owner on notice of 
our claim against Mitsubishi, and of Mitsubishi's potential claim for 
indemnification against the head owner.

Under the circumstances, David and I agree that we should get the joint 
testing scheduled and done as soon as possible.

2. David and I have also spoken about Paul's idea of advancing payment to 
Mitsubishi for the freight claim of $760,000, and agreeing to revert to 
Mitsubishi regarding the demurrage claim by the end of November.  I assume 
that Paul means that we would in fact pay what we believe we owed on the 
$250,000 demurrage claim at or near that time, and that all these amounts 
would be paid on a ""without prejudice"" basis; i.e., that ECT could later 
pursue recovery of those amounts in arbitration against Mitsubishi.

The obvious downside of payment is that we lose our best potential leverage 
for bringing Mitsubishi to the bargaining table, but Mitsubishi has resisted 
that leverage so far.  We are very exposed to advance payment of freight and 
demurrage, subject to our later right of counterclaim if we can successfully 
assert that the ship was at fault.  By paying now, we can avoid the 
attorneys' fees (and, hopefully, some or all of the interest) that would go 
with an interim award to Mitsubishi.  I have not been advised of any 
anticipated problem with getting Mitsubishi to fund a substantial arbitration 
award should ECT be successful in proving its contamination claim and 
recouping the freight and demurrage paid.  

Under these  difficult circumstances, both David and I agree with Paul's 
suggestion that we pay the freight and demurrage up front, without prejudice, 
but only after we have informally discussed this on a solictor-to-solicitor 
basis, so that there is no misunderstanding of ECT's intent to pursue the 
contamination claim, and after a tribunal has been agreed to and any other 
concessions extracted that we can think of.  This will prevent Mitsubishi 
from dragging its feet after we make this payment.  

3.  David and I have spoken about the choice of arbitrators for this 
single-arbitrator proceeding.  He and Neale agree that using a Q.C. would 
give us the best shot at a well-thought-through legal opinion, and here, our 
best argument may be simply to argue that Mitsubishi has not borne its legal 
burden to provide a cargoworthy ship.  Based on David and Neale's suggestion, 
I have asked David to approach Mitsubishi's solicitors on an informal basis 
to discuss three Q.Cs that David and Neale find acceptable, and determine 
whether Mitsubishi's solicitors also find them acceptable.  Once that occurs, 
I will revert back to each of you with a recommendation of a single 
arbitrator.  That should hopefully occur today or tomorrow.

I will continue to keep you advised.

2284,"While I appreciate the virtue of flying below the radar if possible, the 
matter here is complicated by the fact that FERC's discovery rules (18 CFR, 
Subpart D) pertain only to ""proceedings set for hearing . . . and to such 
proceedings as the Commission may order.""  18 CFR 385.401.  In this case, 
FERC stated that ""a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . ."" and 
specifically rejected the use of a ""trial-type evidentiary hearing.""  Slip 
op. at 47-48 & n.97.  Thus, while I have not researched the matter as yet, my 
preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery 
processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order 
and its regulations, unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case.  
(The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it 
specifically attempts to equate ""paper"" hearings with ""trial-type"" hearings; 
see page 1 of its Motion.)

The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery 
in this case under Rule 401.  While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly 
to marketers, FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or 
someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties.  As a result, we 
need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to 
present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing 
with an expedited decisional track, particularly in light of the fact that 
Staff has already conducted.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Richard,

 After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on
options:

1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER
 Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that
is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed,
then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection
and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent
 protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled
to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully
disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of
simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our
formal objections as well.

2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS
 Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for
electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway
either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging
litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might
slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by
seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the
legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this
information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how
confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It
might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron
information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential
proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive
advantage.

3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF
DATA FROM ISO AND PX.
 We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO
and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing
data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of
California data and would sidestep for the
 moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron
cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC
 would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss
picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the
combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need
to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.

4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE
 This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not
reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the
profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is
what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we
 would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and
loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX
data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be
quite large, but just not the cost or expense side.

5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA
 We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position
for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not
entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest
email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)
than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the
transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss
information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner
Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get
money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation
by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice
that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing
this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public
disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to
do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market
participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This
may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the
PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political
environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It
also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00
report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal
objections and sit back and  wait.

6. ME TOO
 Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other
market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is
modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This
makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert
and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read
Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if
the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their
offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says
the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be
met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California
constitutional contempt authority.

7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ
 Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the
PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the
ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It
has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading
the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the
PUC has no jurisdiction.
 Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted
contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that
they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take
the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our
appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at
the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our
objections might be at the ALJ level.

8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA
 We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power
Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC
issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC
has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the
wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light
v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated
by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.
New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state
agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale
market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more
even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a
cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the
information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless
we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of
the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that
this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG
in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same
information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,
anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders
etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if
FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.

9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES
 It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland
General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those
entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely
to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight
we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for
example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and
not able to participate in any change of direction discussions.

Hope this is helpful.

The attached draft answers the California Municipal Utilities Association 
complaint that California markets are not workably competitive and therefore 
FERC should establish cost-based rates.  In its complaint, CMUA argued that 
the market isn't workably competitive because the prices were higher this 
summer than in previous years even in hours where demand was no higher.  
Seabron's paper shows that high prices have resulted from a number of 
unrelated structural and market design factors and increasing attempts at 
regulatory intervention.  He also debunks the assertions that cost-based 
rates will fix the problem in California and will be easily administered by 
FERC.  Our answer is due at FERC tomorrow so please get me your comments ASAP.

2303,"Richard,

This follows up on my telephone conference with you of a moment ago.  This 
case has taken a significant turn for the worse from ECT's standpoint.

As you know, we began the joint testing of the product samples in the U.K. 
this week.  The testing began with the loadport samples, which are the most 
critical. We concentrated on the filterable dirt spec, an area in which we 
believed we had the best chance of proving our case.  However, the tests 
showed that the loadport samples are considerably off spec for filterable 
dirt.  You may recall that SGS had found the loadport samples on spec in all 
respects.  The results of the joint testing reportedly caught all the 
chemists in attendance by surprise.

As will not surprise you, the chemists present for Mitsubishi and our cargo 
underwriters gave the impression that they felt no further testing was 
necessary under the circumstances.

There are three possible explanations that we are considering regarding the 
difference between SGS's results at loadport and the results during the joint 
testing this week:

1.  SGS's results are not credible (unfortunately, this would tend to be 
supported by the pre-sale analysis by ECT of the same or similar product 
that, if my memory is correct, was somewhat off spec for filterable dirt);

2.  the age of the samples (which were taken mid-year last year) may be a 
factor; and 

3.  the ""bug"" earlier reported by SGS, if it exists, may be a factor.

I have spoken this morning about further strategy with David Best and Jim 
Studdert.  We agreed that Steve Jones, our chemist, would suggest a hiatus in 
the testing, giving him time to send us a written report on his findings.  It 
would also give him time to hopefully liaise with Paul Henking and have Paul 
arrange an interview with the SGS surveyor who suggested that the cargo might 
have a ""bug"" in it.  Given the lack of specs in the contract with the 
supplier, it appears to me that we would have to find something significantly 
wrong with the product that falls outside even the very loose ""Elang Crude, 
fit for export purposes"" language in order to have some cause of action 
against the supplier.

Jim will contact our cargo underwriters and obtain a preliminary impression 
from them on how they see the case at this time.

I will continue to keep you advised.

Britt

P.S.--Paul, I would appreciate it if you could call David Best tomorrow and 
get the ball rolling on the ""bug"" issue.  Please don't put anything in 
writing about this issue for Steve Jones yet.","Richard David Best Jim

2305,"As I reported to you from Irvine on Friday, I attended the hearing conducted 
by Senator Dunn in Irvine, California. It was sound bite city, with no good 
press for any generator or marketer.  At the outset of the hearing Sen Dunn 
stated that his committee had been in lengthy discussions regarding 
confidentiality issues with the generators, without success, and that they 
would be sending out subpoenas for records starting on Monday(today) and that 
the production of documents from Cal ISO was to start last Friday.  Sen Dunn 
spent much of the day making his public record , posturing about the 
difficulty of getting any documents from any generator or marketer because of 
claims of confidentiality, and how unresponsive FERC has been. He got the 
FERC lawyer, Robert Pease, to testify that any confidentiality afforded to 
the bid data at Cal ISO under the FERC tariff would end after 6 months. As 
you undoubtedly read, the PUC chairwoman had nothing good to say about the 
generators. Since the subpoenas will probably be forthcoming shortly, do we 
want to have a conference call of the group to discuss what transpired at 
Friday's hearing ? I am interested in knowing  how everyone intends to 
proceed in response to any subpoenas from the Committee,particularly after 
the failed efforts with the protective order. Please call me if we have not 
talked by phone when you get this.

2306,"Here is the letter I was referring to yesterday sent by Reliant's Sacramento
counsel to Senator Dunn.  In paragraph no. 1, Charles Stevens refers to how
small Reliant's market share is in the WSCC power market.  He suggests that
the Committee obtain the entire database, which reflects all bidders in the
market.  He goes on to say that the information from obtaining all of the
data would give a far more accurate picture than could be obtained by
looking at the data of a few ""generators"".

This letter plus some comments that Larry Drivon made to Michael Molland
gave rise to the inference that Reliant's counsel, Charles Stevens, may have
been suggesting in his discussions with Senator Dunn's staff that Enron
should be included in the process.  It may be that the inference will turn
out not to be accurate.  That is all the information we have on the subject.

2351,"Tony & Frazier -- several comments from TW Commercial.

Page 1:  Streamlined Credit -- what does ""interested parties"" mean? parties 
interested in bidding, or parties interested in us having a look at their 
credit ?  Probably need to make this clear; on first reading, looks like 
obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional.  (Don't we want everyone 
to get approval ahead of bidding?).

Page 2:  you state that ""individual bid transactions are kept confidential.""  
What is confidential:  the identity of the shipper?  the bid itself?  In TW's 
IOS, we post the individual bids as they come in, but do not post the name of 
the shipper.  We feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get 
a higher rate as shippers bid against each other, and likewise recommend 
online bids be posted in real time.  I notice you call them ""sealed bids"" on 
page 4 -- not true if we're going to show them.

Page 3:  why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish 
creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding?  Especially 
since we plan to attract brand-new shippers by offering this service.  Our 
credit dept. folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between 
2 and 4 on bid day.

If we're asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places, our example 
should be to 3 decimal places (e.g., $0.351).

Page 7:  ""an"" Capacity Trading Agreement should be ""a"" Capacity Trading 
Agreement.

Page 8:  So we don't appear low-tech, let's go ahead and tell shippers we 
plan to have the Request for Service and the service agreement available for 
online submittal at some point in the near future.

Also, we've never asked shippers to submit a Request for Service with each 
bid.  A shipper may bid and re-bid several times over the bidding process.  
They really only need to submit the Request for Service at the time of, or 
prior to, the first bid.  I recommend stating ""You must submit a Request for 
Service prior to making your initial bid"" so they don't think they have to 
submit a new one every time they revise their bid.

Page 9:  Under ""When TW will Respond"":  need to specify how notification will 
be sent.  

Page 14:  Column that says ""Price"" should say ""Rate"" (for a second there we 
thought you were talking about gas prices).  Also, please use example rates 
that are more realistic for TW (in the $0.240 to $0.299 would be great...)

Thanks for all your hard work on this.  I'll be here if you have any 
questions.

2355,"Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a 
summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA 
could purchase an ""out of the money"" call option essentially cost free, since 
its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds 
from ENA's ability to then ""move the market"" through the establishment of the 
long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested 
that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the 
marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to 
other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with 
ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for 
other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first 
pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as 
possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but 
rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier 
suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference 
between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if 
the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  

TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a 
marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable 
record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale 
of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily 
include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have 
serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing 
affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that 
applies to all interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will 
constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as 
such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's 
position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the 
transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment 
will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the 
option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso 
as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program 
would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why 
some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would 
create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps 
because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the 
underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make 
hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to 
placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for 
capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require 
TW to do so in a final order.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of 
September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC 
filing by mid-September.

I don't know if my dad told you, but I am at Tulane law school and enjoying
it very much.  The work is challeging, but I am really happy with the my
choice of paths.  The campus is beautiful, the people are normal, the town is
amazing (a bit distracting at times), and my professors and the law school in
general are fantastic.

I am writing you to ask for your advice.  They are beginning to apply the job
search pressure to us (it is already the 8th week) and I am trying to figure
out my best course of action.  I have heard that most of the big firms in
Houston aren't even looking for students after only their 1st year-- that
they prefer to interview after the 2nd year for summer clerk positions and
then associate jobs. Do you know of any smaller firms or specific attorneys
that I might be able to pursue with a letter and resume?

What did you do after your first year?  Did you stay in Texas?  I do know
that I want to practice in Houston, so I think that working there during
this, my first summer, would be a smart idea.  It will at least give me more
time to make contacts/ meet people.

What do you think?  Any thoughts/advice you have would be greatly appreciated.

   1. Of or pertaining to people or region beyond the mountains.

   2. Supporting the Pope's authority over the Roman Catholic Church in all

noun

   1. One who lives beyond the mountains.

   2. One who favors papal supremacy.

[From Medieval Latin ultramontanus, from Latin ultra- (beyond) + mont-, mons
(mountain).]

   ""Adopting the sort of tone you use with recalcitrant pets or unruly
   children, the government makes no concessions. This is par for the course
   on reform of the Commons, where chief whip Ann Taylor and ultramontane
   Margaret Beckett, leader of the house, have been veritable forces of

Once in my life I was a Cleveland Indian. I boarded a plane at the New Delhi
airport and landed at my destination, Cleveland, to attend a graduate school
at Case Western Reserve University. Soon after arriving, I discovered the
picturesque vast expanse of Lake Erie to the north of the city and learnt
that we were North Shore residents. Or were we?

Lake Erie separates the city of Cleveland from Canada. Upon visiting Canada
on the other side of the lake I discovered that the folks there also claimed
to be on the North Shore. And I realized they were right, since Cleveland
actually lies on the South Shore of the Lake. Now, try telling that to
countless business owners in Cleveland who have named their enterprises
""North Shore Computers"", North Shore this and North Shore that.

Well, I guess it's all relative. It all depends on what side of the fence
or pond one is on. And the same is true with ultramontane. First it was
applied by the Italians, rather contemptuously, to those living north of
the Alps, such as the French and Germans. Later, the tables were turned
on them, and those on the North began calling Italians ultramontane. Now
it could be anyone living on the other side of a mountain, a foreigner,
or an ultraconservative.

A straightforward looking word, and what a history it packs in those four
little syllables! This week we'll look at a few other terms with Italian
connections, words of various shapes and sizes from the land of pizza
and pasta.                                                        -Anu

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to test the waters and see what kind of interest there was in 
doing Steak Night tomorrow night at Little Woodrows.  I feel like it's been a 
while since we really rallied the troops and I know I have personally missed 
the interaction.  It's also been a while since we've attempted to solve the 
worlds problems over cold Shiner and I think the world may be the worse for 
it.  So, get back to me and let me know if anyone's up for an evening of 
eating, drinking and most definitely being merry.  If it looks like 'a go', 
I'll shoot everyone a follow-up email complete with ETA.

2373,"white elephant (hwyt EL-uh-fent) noun

   1. A possession unwanted by the owner but difficult to dispose of.

   2. A possession entailing great expense out of proportion to its
      usefulness or value to the owner.

   3. An abnormally whitish or pale elephant, usually found in Thailand;
      an albino elephant.

[From the perhaps apocryphal tale that the King of Siam would award a
disagreeable courtier a white elephant, the upkeep of which would ruin the
courtier.]

   ""Now an orchestra opening a new hall has reason to pray, solemnly and at
   length, that it will not be saddled with a white elephant with mediocre
   acoustics.""
   Allan Kozinn, A Venerable Concert Hall That's the Belle of the Ball,
   The New York Times, Sep 30, 2000.

   An exaggerated, especially glamorized, estimate of oneself; conceit.

   ""The public property is not so much her as Bovarism. She is part of the

2388,"Hello all,

I know, I know... the updates have been few and far between. But
here it goes.

Its about 1:30 pm on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon.  I had a safe
trip to Ooty and back chaperoning the high school girls field
hockey trip. Ooty is another hill station about an 8 hour bus trip
from here. The students travel there about 3 times a semester to
compete in various sporting events. Its significantly bigger so there
are more schools (and more shopping opportunities) there to
compete with. We left Thursday afternoon and arrived Thursday
evening. On Friday, it was the outdoor field hockey competition
between 4 schools. The girls won 2nd place. On Saturday the girls
won first place in indoor hockey. Hebron, a British missionary
school, hosted the tournament. It was the first time I saw so many
people that looked like me. It was unbelievable how many blond
hair, blue-eyed people there were. Hebron was founded around the
same time Kodaikanal International School was (about 100 years
ago) and while KIS has transformed itself from a purely American
Christian school to an International School, Hebron has remained
virtually the same with regards to its Christian beginnings and to
the students enrolled. Its largely British, with Australians and New
Zealanders and very few Indian students. I had a great time getting
to know the girls and answering a lot of their questions about the
States for the 12th grade girls who have applied to colleges in the
US.

The trip was amazing, but also a bit depressing. Its so sad to travel
through. Some of the living conditions are unbelievably poor
especially in the plains. We are also so fortunate to be able to live
the way we do.  Anyways... I am also extremely busy substituting
a 9th grade English honors class. The teacher is out for 2 weeks
for a supposed spider bite and skin graph. I really wish I had paid
more attention in high school. The students are reading
Shakespeare and luckily its Romeo and Juliet. ITs about the only
Shakespeare story that anyone can fumble through. It was to
initially be a supervisory role when we thought he would be out 3
days but its now more a teaching role since hes out for 2 weeks.
Can't wait for him to return.

Gotta run. Want to try to take a nap before ultimate frisbee. Didn't
make it home until 3 am last night from Ooty. I will be sending
another email mid-March after long weekend. I am heading to the
southern state of Kerala with Priya and her family for a boating
backwaters trip through some Indian villages.

Hope all is well! Take care.

Love,

   Sunk fence.

[From French haha, reduplicative of ha!, exclamation of surprise, that might
come out when tripped by such an obstacle.]

   ""They covet our haha fences, tucked out of view by ditches and so named
   because of their surprise value.""
   Tina Kelley, Zoo Nice To See You: Woodland Park Basks In Spotlight,
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Sep 19, 1995.

Instead of explaining in a thousand words what a ha-ha looks like,
I'll show you a picture: http://www.yale.edu/yup/images/bormann3.jpg
Etymologists claim we got the word ha-ha from ha!, the sound one might
exclaim on getting tripped by that trap, otherwise known as a sunken
fence.  I'm sure they have done their research and are right. But I
can't help thinking it might have been derived from the laughter of
a French aristocrat when an unsuspecting guest tripped while visiting
his chateau.

Ah-ha, that gives me an idea, just in time for this April Fool's Day!
I think I'll call a landscape designer.

""Hi, Mr. Dougwell? I'd like to order a ha-ha around my apartment.""
""You'd like to order what?""
""Ha-ha! You think you can do it by next week? I've some visitors coming
 over. And don't forget to bring your Hard Hat and Hack Hammer.""

All kidding aside, what's the brouhaha about this thing? In the 18th
century someone came up with the clever idea of a fence that let the
property owner have an unhindered view of the landscape, giving an
illusion of contiguous land, while protecting him from trespass. Here's
a fascinating essay on the deeper meanings of ha-ha:
http://bsc.edu/~jtatter/borders.html

hear about your back; I know what it is like.  As much as you are inclined to 
run around and get things done, the thing that worked best for me with my 
back problem was just to recline as much as possible!  My house truly became 
a mess, but guess what, the world did not end.  

I really like your monosyllabic choices for names:  Kyle and Quinn.  For some 
reason I really like the name Elizabeth with both of those.  Perhaps because 
it balances out the unisex quality of the first name.  I think you really 
have to meet the baby before you decide for sure.  Who knows, she might turn

RE:
Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading Floor and Clearing 
Members
________________________________________________________________

The expiration date for the June 2001 options contract for Crude Oil (LOM1) 
is Thursday, May 17, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options 
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or 
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options 
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized 
representative present at their normal work station promptly at 5:30 p.m. 
until released by the Exchange staff as specified below.  All adjustments 
and/or corrections, must be accompanied by relevant supporting documentation 
prior to being incorporated into expiration processing, in essence making the 
expiration processing an extension of the afternoon trade resolution 
procedures.  All input to the NYMEX Clearing Department will conclude no 
later than 30 minutes after floor representatives are released.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110), Floor Trade Correction (299-2068 and 299-2169) 
personnel, as well as a representative of the Floor Committee will be 
available to assist with the processing of notices of Exercise and 
Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other questions or 
problems you may have.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

As we discussed, attached is the memo that I wrote last September on the tax 
implications of having a financial trader in Sydney.  As you will note, we 
followed a service fee approach to reimburse the Sydney office on a cost-plus 
basis for the costs incurred by the financial trader (including his 
remuneration).  Important in this arrangement is that the Sydney financial 
trader is not the principal in the trades but is only acting in a preparatory 
or auxiliary manner for the ENA financial trades.

As we discussed yesterday, I will forward the latest draft of the service 
agreement to you by e-mail.  David, could you send Sara and me conforming 
copies of the executed agreement?

Also, we should probably also discuss the status of the documentation 
relating to these trades.

With respect to the comments provided by Rick Tucker I have provided my own 
comments below to you and Sara:

Schedule:
Part 1:
I am OK increasing the default threshold to $3MM for PCES.

Part 5:
Sara may have comments on this.

Credit Support Annex:
Paragraph 13 -Threshold
I feel that if we provide a $10MM guaranty to PCES, they should have no 
problem accepting a $10MM collateral threshold.

Paragraph 13 - L/C 
I am OK with this.

Paragraph 13(m)
n/a

Schedule 1:
Probably need further discussion amongst ourselves.


I am out tomorrow, 9/20/00, but let's try and work on this towards the end of

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

Here is where we ended up yesterday after discussing the LC situation with Debbie:

1.	Debbie and her group will initially review each LC that has been posted to Enron to determine if it is ""transaction specific"" or if it covers all trades with the counterparty.  If it is transaction specific and the counterparty has performed, then no further action is required.  If the counterparty has not performed then Debbie will work with us to see if a draw can be made.

2.	If the LC covers all trades, Debbie will send copies of the LC and the transactions docs to me and we will determine what rights, if any, we have to draw.  Each month, we will focus on those LC's that are due to expire that month.    

Call me if you have any questions.  We will distribute the work to the trading lawyers as the need arises.

2452,"Hi Sara, 

(1) For clarification, my voicemail was not full on Friday - I checked it, 
got several messages including one fromTom Doukas and called him and others 
immediately as I arrived.  My voicemail was full on Monday - when I checked 
in with Keegan on Monday late morningshe advised me of such and I deleted the 
calls periodically.  I do realize that I do get a lot of calls and emails due 
to the 50 or so  brokerage related agreements & the numerous deals I am 
working on so I do try to clear the box daily.

(2) I can be of more assistance in the future if, instead of telling Keegan 
you need a file, that you contact me directly. That way, I can make sure that 
you get what you need.   I took a lot of Enron calls and faxes while on 
vacation so I would not have objected had you contacted me directly.  That 
way we do not have to put the burden on Keegan to locate my files -- although 
I am sure she is more than willing to help, I do not think she knows much 
about where I keep particular files or documents.  

(3) Also with respect to Keegan, I wanted to relay to you that she felt 
uncomfortable being quizzed by you or  passing judgment as to why I have 
chosen to receive orthodontal treatment in New York rather than in Houston.  
(The answer to the question is irrelevant.  If I were getting treatment 
across the street from the office, I still could be here to do any work.  My 
getting the treatment in New York, while I am on vacation, does not affect my 
presence in the office or undermine in any way my ability to do my job).  

Equally important,  apparently these were not fair questions of Keegan, as 
she has informed me that they made her feel uncomfortable and she only 
answered because she sensed or thought she was obligated to do so.  Nor do I 
think they are fair of me.  I do not wish to justify my medical decisions 
with my colleagues, especially provided that I am taking vacation time or 
sick time I rightfully  can take.  It was previously represented to me that 
our department policy is that when out for medical reasons, we should provide 
in an email or otherwise convey a general statement - the details are not 
required.  If that is not the policy then please advise.  In any case, if for 
some justifiable reason you have to know such information and you need to 
rely on it, it is best to ask me directly so that you can be sure that the 
information you are getting is accurate.

Part 1 (c) ""Threshold Amount"" - We are willing to accept your proposal for
the flat number of $100 million for Enron, but we cannot accept $2 million
for the Moore Global.  The majority of our documents are bilateral in
nature, but we have accepted a 2:1 ratio, thus we have proposed $50 million
for Moore Global.  Please reconsider.

Part 3(b) Documents to be delivered - I have added the legal opinion
language, but I just wanted to confirm that Enron will pay for these
requested legal opinions.  I found out that FIF Master Fund, Ltd  also uses
Graham Thompson as outside counsel.


Credit Support Annex:
Paragraph 13 (b)(iv) - Thresholds - We are willing to accept a $0 Threshold
even though with most of our counterparties, we have at least a $5 million
threshold.   On the other hand, we find it to be a operational nuisance to
have to transfer collateral back and forth with a ""minimum transfer amount""
of zero, thus we would like to stick with $500,000 since we do not think
$500,000 is an unreasonable amount of exposure for either party and it would
eliminate the nuisance factor.

Thank you very much for your help in this matter and we look forward to
hearing from you.

TO:  NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS

FROM: Patrick F. Conroy, Senior Vice President

SUBJECT: TERMINATION OF MEMBERS RETENTION AND RETIREMENT PLAN

The remaining assets under the MRRP are being distributed to the participants 
with Continuous Service between 10 and 14 years under the Plan. Under the 
terms of the Plan, participants with more than 15 years of Continuous Service 
are entitled to receive a payout equal to the net present value of their 
calculated benefit, to the extent of assets held in trust.  Any remaining 
assets are to be distributed to the participants with Continuous Service 
between 10 and 14 years. In earlier notices, we estimated that there would be 
sufficient assets to pay approximately 26% of the partial benefits otherwise 
calculable.  However, after the final reconciliation of the census 
information used to calculate the original estimates, the liability 
associated with the fully vested participants increased substantially. The 
final calculations indicate that the remaining assets available to the 
participants with Continuous Services between 10 and 14 years will represent 
14% of the otherwise calcu!
la!
ted benefits.  (In dollar terms, the liability to the fully-vested 
beneficiaries had increased by approximately $1.4 million.)

In earlier notices we cautioned that the estimated benefits were subject to 
change based upon corrections to the participant database statistics. During 
the review process there were substantial corrections required.  A detailed 
explanation of the corrected liability amounts will be presented to the Board.

If anyone would like to discuss their situation with me personally, I can be 
reached at ext. 8-2285.

wonderful and sad.  We saw the greatest people and
most breathtaking scenery on our way to the funeral of
our friend Richard, a beautiful person who died after
a long battle with cancer.  I'm wearing his red sox
cap in the picture which has been returned to the city
from which it came.

Last week Maddie had her first birthday which was
attended by many family and friends.  Keep checking

as halloween trick-or-treating once we get the film

I hope you had a god weekend.  I was finally able to catch up on all the
gimmicks being thrown around to jump-start the economy.  Have you seen the
one that would temporarily suspend sales taxes, a la 0.0% financing on
autos?  What the politico's should really do is get some ideas from the
organizers of the Victoria's Secret (no, there's no relation unfortunately)
TV show or the Britney Spear's HBO show.  Have you seen the ratings on
those!?  That seems to be what is drawing the American consumer these days. 

But despite that being still up in the air, it looks like the economy is in
the process of bottoming anyway.  Stocks have continued to rally, oil is
below $18, commodities have rallied, money is up and so is refi.  If we
could only get the surveys to behave, we'd be very happy.  Interest rates
had been falling up until last week when the backed up.  This was largely
interpreted as the bond market smelling the economic recovery.  If rates
get too high, it could obviously be a problem, but this ""hiccup"" in rates
is something we have seen before in periods of transition.  Page 3
highlights the ""hiccups"" in the past when you had the economy shifted from
a recession to a recovery.  

Another big question on everyone's mind is Holiday Sales.  They are widely
expected to be weak, weak, weak.  So where does that leave room for a
surprise? on the upside.  Turn to page 6 for all the positives that could
help Holiday Sales.  I for one am not expecting a lump of coal.  

The political report highlights the effects of the war in Afghanistan on
globalization.  Despite all the initial doom-and-gloom, it looks like it
has actually pushed global cooperation along.  

Jim Moltz thinks the market is just about fairly valued here at about 22
times 2002 earnings.  That being said, he also thinks the liquidity
available out there will drive the market higher when those assets start to
actively look for higher yielding instruments.  Some of that could be into
the long end of the curve if rates stay higher, but some will also be into
the equity markets.  Jim also tweaked his operating earnings estimate for
2001 from $38 to $39.50.  2002 is still at $50.  

Have a great week and a very happy Thanksgiving.  If there is anything I
can do, I will be in so please just let me know.

 I called Michele Cisneros-Ruch per your request about Montana issues since

passage of a set of bills currently in the Montana Legislature dealing with 
1) Taxes on Excess Profits for Electric Sales, 2) Wholesale Transaction 
Taxes, 3) Regulation of Wholesale Prices. 

 I made contact with a friend who consults for PP&L Montana to learn the 
status of the bills.  The likelihood is that all the bills will pass and be 
sorted out in some kind of super conference committee to arrive at the final 
bill.  Montana Power and PP&L Montana are fighting the bills.    PP&L Montana 
maintaining that the attempt to regulate wholesale sales is illegal, since 
FERC has jurisdiction.  The legislature is not dissuaded by the arguments and 
will likely pass anyway and wind up going to Court.  One of the major issues 
is the expiration of Montana Power's contract for default retail service from 
PP&L Montana.  It expires on June 30, 2002, a few months before the next 
election.  They want someone to blame if prices rise (the Republicans that 
is) and the Democrats would be happy to blame the Republicans.

2520,"John and I met with the group headed up by NERC that supports reliability 
legislation.  Included in the group are:  NERC, CEA, EEI, APPA, TAPS, ELCON, 
EPSA, PJM, Entergy.  The group is attempting to reconvene and indicate their 
continuing support for the reliability legislation (33 pages) that was 
drafted last year.  Enron, ELCON and EPSA did not support the final drafted 
legislation, although we are told that Enron (through Dan Watkiss) was close 
to giving its support.

This group still supports the legislation that was drafted last year and 
would like Enron to give its support as well.  ELCON has many concerns with 
the legislation, and EPSA is still on the fence (waiting to hear from us, I 
think).   John Shelk and I indicated to the group that Enron is reassessing 
the legislation and our position on the legislation.  Another meeting 
(conference call) is scheduled for June 15.   Enron seems to be somewhat of a 
linchpin in this debate -- the group thinks the legislation will be effective 
if Enron signs on, even without ELCON's support, but they seem to think it 
has less effectiveness without Enron.  Therefore, the group is very anxious 
to hear our position.

John and I are meeting with Dan Watkiss tomorrow to find out from him where 
we left off on the drafting.   We want to see how comfortable Dan was with 
the draft legislation and where he felt that changes were still needed.  We 
are then meeting with ELCON on Thursday to get a better idea of what their 
concerns are with the legislation (it seems to be a pretty long list).  I 
will send an email to this group on Friday letting everyone know what came 
out of these meetings and we can then discuss what position Enron should take 
in this group effort.

2530,"I spoke with Craig Glazer (PJM Wash Rep) yesterday afternoon regarding the status of the northeast RTO efforts.  As you may recall, we, along with many other market participants and PJM, advocated a Board makeup for the new Northeast RTO board of 5 PJM Board members, 3 NY board members, and 2 NE board members.  New York and New England are pushing hard for parity - 3 from each board.

PJM is concerned that FERC is going to take the political way out and go with parity.  Our concern with this approach has always been that if all three ISOs are equally represented, progress will not be made in forming the new RTO because the other two ISO board members will retain their bias and preferences for their own ISO sturucture, and development of the northeast RTO will be delayed indefinately.  These three ISOs have been working on the seams issues, through the MOU process, for the past 2 years and absolutely nothing happened -- no progress was made.  FERC recognized this in its July 12 order on mediation.  

If FERC does take the political route and order parity on board makeup, then it is imperative that FERC issue a clear, unambiguous order directing that the PJM system be implemented, that not many changes are made to the PJM platform (in the form of ""best practices"" from other ISOs), and that the new Board members' fiduciary duty must be to the new RTO.  If they go this route, we would also want FERC to require that PJM management and staff be the Project Leader in seeing that the new RTO gets up and running.

Other issues of concern are:

California Audit
	See ISO report and generators response (generators' response is attached -- faxed ISO's report)

Congestion Management
	Preference for ERCOT system?
	Preference for PJM type system?

Types of cost/benefits analysis that would be helpful

2534,"Congress Passes the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000

Late Friday afternoon, December 15, Congress passed the Commodity Futures 
Modernization Act of 2000.  The purpose of the Act is to eliminate 
unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities 
falling within the  coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act (""CEA"") and the 
provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives 
transactions.  By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product 
innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets. 
Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron's further product 
innovation and growth.  Specifically, the Act provides important legal 
certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an 
over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading 
platforms.  Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation.

Bilateral Transactions

Under the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than 
agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on a 
multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as 
the transactions are entered solely between ""eligible contract 
participants""(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital 
thresholds and other requirements under the Act).  This provision essentially 
codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward 
contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has 
frustrated product innovation and growth.  

Multilateral Transactions

In addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract or 
transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as 
they the transactions are between ""eligible commercial participants"", are 
entered into on a ""principle-to-principle basis"" and that take place on a 
multi-party ""electronic facility"".  This exemption could facilitate expansion 
of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal 
requirements will have to be met.

Other Transactions

The Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are 
of interest to Enron, including ""credit risk measure"" commodities and weather 
derivatives .  Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet 
certain legal thresholds.

This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective 
support of many Enron employees has been crucial.  Thank you to all that have 
contributed to the passage on this important legislation.  We will have a 
more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future. Do not 
hesitate to contact me at (202) 466- 9158 of Mark Taylor at (713) 853-7459

2537,"FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders:

EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous 
aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) 
and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in 
APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically 
insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of 
generators in the following provisions:

 -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order 
to seek interconnection
 -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot
 -- Specific milestones must be added
 -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA
 -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load 
 -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study
 -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a 
generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal)
 -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm
 -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to 
satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator 
of      information that affects the generator
 -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety

FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all 
pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation.

Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and 
CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to 
pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may 
incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in 
VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC.  
((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest.  
FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some 
confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing 
customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.))

Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides 
that ""Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long 
as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by 
Transmission Provider up to that point.""  FPL's unfiled procedures allow 
withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers 
includes similar procedures.  

What are ""material changes"" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's 
provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) 
in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the 
move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions 
(unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more 
than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) 
change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the 
length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, 
that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can 
result in loss of queue spot.  

Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.  CP&L 
will provide workpapers used in the studies on request.",VEPCO,,FERC EPMI DENA Arizona Public Service's IA APS CP&L EPMI/Duke Transmission Provider FPL Consumer's IAs

2539,"We have just learned that AEP is agreeing to construct the Dumont Substation 
in Northern Indiana (which we argued for in the Michigan transmission case): 
however, much of the capacity made available has been reserved with rollover 
rights:

1.  Duke has purchased 416mw beginning the summer of 2002.  It is to provide 
transmission from two Duke merchant plants into MECS (we think to serve a 
utility).

2. Exelon has purchased 500MW for transmission into Com Ed (east to west) for 
2001-2002 under a special tariff arrangement which results in alternative 
higher pricing.

For those following the Michigan case, Kerry will be drafting our brief in 
which we will argue that to extent the transmission capacity is not being 
used to serve competitive retail load, this should not count towards the 
2000mw of increased capacity as required by the dereg statute.

For those covering Com Ed, this bolsters the info we have received regarding 
Com Ed's concern about having adequate capacity.

2540,"Late this morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the
committee print, as amended, of an energy package that addresses
conservation, clean coal, renewables, hydro, nuclear, and boutique fuels.
The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill.  Other committees -- Ways and
Means, Science, and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week.
Thus, the House is on track to consider a merged package before the start
of the August Recess on August 3rd.

As to electricity, during the several days of debate this week both
Chairmen Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to
electricity issues.  Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the
subcommittee he chairs will hold a hearing on Friday, July 20th on all
electricity issues other than transmission.  While Mr.  Barton has publicly
held out hope of marking up an electricity bill this month, sources on and
off the committee do not see this timetable as realistic.  On the Senate
side, the majority staff is working on an electricity ""white paper"" that
may be circulated for comment next week.

Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron:

1.   Last night, on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall, Green and
John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by
Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo
(D-CA)) that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and
essentially ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers.

2.   First thing this morning the Committee, again on a largely partisan
basis (with Democrats Hall, Green, John and Towns), rejected a Waxman
amendment to impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other
than generation added after 1/1/01).  (Originally, Mr. Waxman was going to
offer amendment to impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not
supply all available power during an emergency, but he ended up offering
basically what he had pursued in subcommittee on the old ""Californa Only""
bill.)

3.   The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the
Natural Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas ""transportation
facility"" shall not be added to the National Register of Historic Places
until FERC has abandoned the facility.  Apparently there have been some
instances of ""old"" pipelines being considered as ""historic places"" under
federal law.  The House Resources Committee added a similar amendment to
its package yesterday.

4.   By voice vote, the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require
the president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse
gases down to 1990 levels.  There was strong opposition voiced by many
Republicans and Democrats to this amendment.

5.   By mixed vote of 24 to 29, the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment
to set cost and performance goals for renewables, including wind power, and
authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50
percent).

RE: Commission Actions to Increase Supply and Decrease
Consumption in the Western United States--Key Points for
EPSA Comments Due MARCH 30TH

As we previously reported, on March 14, 2001, FERC announced certain actions 
to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in 
an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas 
Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further 
Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption.  The 
following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to ""immediately 
help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory 
incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure.""  The 
Commission also invited comments on certain proposals.  This memo includes a 
list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March 30th.

Overview of Order

The Order reflects a thorough review of  ""all of [FERC's] rate and facility 
certification authorities in the areas of electric energy, natural gas, 
hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy 
supply""; however, the Commission noted that its authority is ""somewhat 
limited.""  While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the 
lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission, 
as well as demand reduction measures, the Commission noted that the impact of 
California's energy shortage on the Western Interconnection ""underscores the 
regional, interstate nature of the energy marketplace.""  Accordingly, it 
encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for 
western markets.

EPSA appreciates the Commission's effort to exercise the full extent of its 
authority to help ease the West's energy problems.  Taken together, the 
Commission's proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational 
solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West.  Most importantly, the 
Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment, 
including increased generation, transmission and natural gas pipeline 
facilities.

The Commission's immediate actions, which will expire on December 31, 2001, 
include:

-Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to 
provide FERC with a list of short-term grid enhancements.

-Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and 
fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities (QF).

-Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup 
and self-generation for businesses with prior notice waivers and market-based 
rate authorization.

-Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale 
market-based rates.

The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals, including:

-Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs.

-Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly 
increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term.

-10-year depreciation for short-term transmission projects, and 15-year 
depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service 
by November 1, 2002.

-Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA  o210(d) to help 
alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load.

EPSA's Comments

In its conclusion, the Commission stated that comments should be ""concise and 
focused.""  Accordingly, we suggest that EPSA's comments focus on the 
following areas:

? Applaud the Commission's effort to increase supplies from QFs, but 
encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to 
sell to creditworthy parties.

? We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the 
relative merits of an incremental versus a ""rolled in"" approach to 
interconnection and upgrade costs.  Therefore, while we may lack a consensus 
on the question as a final policy position, we believe that the extreme 
circumstances surrounding the Order, and the urgent need to move power 
quickly into the Western system, make it wise to endorse FERC's instant 
recommendation.

? The Commission's proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating 
to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher 
ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps.  The 
Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in 
regional transmission organizations.  However, given the current situation 
and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher 
ROE, EPSA could support this proposal.

? Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on 
the energy supply system.  Therefore, the Commission's proposed waivers of 
blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects, 
are favorable developments.

We will discuss the Order and EPSA's comments during tomorrow's Regulatory 
Affairs/Power Marketers' conference call.  In addition, we have been asked to 
consider what type of short-term relief could be included in federal 
legislation.  We will discuss this question as well.  To access the call, 
dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call. In the meantime,

2547,"As I understand Rick's message and discussion with Harry.......... can you 
try something like this:

1)  Legislatively blocking open-access is a radical response to a perceived 
""short-term"" problem and is not necessary to achieve the goal of HB 1692.  
The legislature has found that competition is an appropriate remendy 
(alternative) to regulation through the passage of SB7.
2)  The legislature recognized that certain areas of Texas requires a more 
""structured"" schedule than that required for the rest of the State and 
nothing that has happened in the recent past should change that recognition.
3)  If price protection is the legislature's concern (an the purpose of HB 
1692), we can provide language in HB 1692 that meets their concern by; a)  
continue cost-based regulation for utiity service with no additional costs 
due to limited open-access, b)  allow limited open-access as an alternative 
to utility service (more options available to customers are better than no 
options if price protection is the goal) and c) there are no guarantees that 
cost-based rate regulation will meet the objective of HB 1692 (rates can go 
up due to load growth, load decline, fuel price volatility and other economic 
factors).
4)  Customers (wholesale and retail) should support this.  Certainly gives 
them leverage against potential rate increases under regulation.
5)  SPS will likely want assurances that their shareholders are not adversly 
affected (dollars spent to implement customer choice are allowed to be 
recovered in HB 1692).  This should be a non-issue.  
5)  Enron will be more than happy to assist SPS to dispose (market) any 
excess capacity/energy as a result of limited customer choice in a manner  
which may result in a better return to shareholders (amending 1692  may 
actually help SPS).

Regarding this call tomorrow: are you going to be on this?

I gather from Jim there is a lot of worry about saying anything about how
the unit commitment process works (if it is in a centralized fashion).
That's fine, but I just wanted to get your own views on this. I wrote this
in response to the idea that we were looking for something quick and
effective to put in ASAP. The closer the parallels to working markets (e.g.
PJM) the better. That to me means following the PJM model fairly closely,
and not diverging into other tracks on the RTO process. However, I see how
people like Sue Mara are going to be very upset about this.

We can develop some other options (and they are being proposed in many of
the RTO debates around the country), but I don't want us to end up
advocating things that either won't work, are very complicated to design and
implement (e.g. the California system, with re-dispatch iterations etc.), or
just plain don't make sense. I guess the next question is how to present
this to Steve Kean.

Anyway, as tomorrow's call seems to be controversial it might be useful to
have a chat first. I should be in the office most of the afternoon, or you

2556,"Dear Colleague:

The Edison Electric Institute just published a report I wrote on Real-Time 
Balancing Operations and Markets: Key to Competitive Wholesale Electricity 
Markets. The report is available from the Publications page of my website, 
www.EHirst.com. Here is a summary of the report:

Electricity production and consumption must occur at essentially the same 
time. Therefore, real-time (minute-to-minute) operations and the associated 
markets and prices are essential ingredients of a competitive wholesale 
electricity industry. In addition, these intrahour markets are the foundation 
of all forward markets and contracts, including hour- and day-ahead markets, 
monthly futures, and bilateral contracts. Finally, these intrahour operations 
maintain system reliability by ensuring that enough and the right kinds of 
supply and demand resources are available when needed. 

Because of various load, generation, and transmission factors, balancing 
generation to load on a minute-to-minute basis is complicated. Loads are 
volatile, both from hour to hour and from minute to minute during the morning 
rampup and evening dropoff. Generators differ substantially in their costs of 
electricity production. In addition, generators have various idiosyncratic 
characteristics, such as maximum and minimum output levels and maximum 
ramprates, that limit their ability to respond rapidly to changes in system 
load or generation. Finally, transmission characteristics affect the 
real-time balancing function because of congestion and sudden transmission 
outages. These factors can lead to dramatic and rapid changes in electricity 
prices, including occasional negative prices when generators pay someone to 
take their output.

The early years of operations by independent system operators (ISOs), based 
on the experiences in New England, New York, and California, show how 
difficult it is to translate the theory and initial design of competitive 
markets into ones that work efficiently. These ISOs have been plagued with 
various startup problems that artificially raise electricity costs to 
consumers, implicitly encourage strategic bidding by some generators, do not 
sufficiently discipline generator market power, sometimes yield insufficient 
resources, and impair reliability. Fortunately, the ISOs have been quick to 
identify and remedy flaws in their initial market designs. On the other hand, 
the ISOs have done a poor job of documenting these problems and their 
resolutions.

This report is primarily a primer on how such intrahour operations and 
markets should work. It demonstrates these principles through several 
examples. These examples deal with generator ramprate limits, low-operating 
limits, startup costs, and other generator characteristics. Other examples 
show how energy-limited (e.g., hydro) units differ in their bidding and 
operations from capacity-constrained (e.g., thermal) units, how the 
consideration of multiple time intervals affects operations and pricing, how 
generators located outside the control area are treated differently from 
those within the control-area boundary, how interval pricing combined with 
hourly settlements can encourage generators to ignore dispatch signals, and 
how intermittent resources (such as wind) affect control-area operations. 

Although U.S. wholesale competitive markets today suffer from a variety of 
problems, there is reason to be optimistic. Ultimately, the ISOs (and, later 
on, RTOs) will identify and fix the problems within their market structures, 
and they will adequately document their problems and the associated 
resolutions so that their market participants and the designers of other 
systems can learn from past mistakes. Ultimately, efficient real-time markets 
should allow reliability councils and system operators to largely replace 
command-and-control rules with market signals (i.e., prices that vary rapidly 
in response to changes in system security). These changes should lower the 
costs of maintaining reliability; deploy supply and demand resources more 
efficiently; and guide investments in new generation, transmission, and 
demand-side resources.

***FERC launches formal hearing in El Paso case
     A collection of high-powered attorneys crowded a FERC hearing 
room yesterday for the launch of a formal hearing into 
allegations of market power abuse by El Paso and its affiliates. 
While a decision is still a way off, the presiding judge in the case 
made it clear that FERC must find a precise way to measure market 
share in California before ruling on the case.
     The hearing also marked the public release of a controversial 
market power study by The Brattle Group, which was commissioned 
by Southern California Edison to find evidence of market power 
abuse by El Paso marketing affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. The 
Brattle Group said that it found substantial evidence that El Paso 
manipulated California's gas market -- a claim that remains 
strongly in dispute (see story, page 4).
     In an opening statement, FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge 
Curtis Wagner laid down the parameters for the hearing. The 
burden of proof, he said, is on the California Public Utilities 
Commission, which filed the original Section 5 complaint against 
El Paso. But once a case is made, Wagner added, ""the burden of 
going forward with evidence to rebut that case shifts to El Paso 
Merchant and the parties on its side of the table.""
     The case originated last year, when the CPUC asked FERC to 
abrogate a series of transportation contracts between El Paso 
Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant. The California regulators 
claimed the capacity award was rigged, and further complained of 
a conspiracy to drive up the delivered price of gas into California.
     In March, FERC dismissed the CPUC's claim that there was 
favoritism in the bidding process for El Paso pipeline capacity (GD 
3/29). But the commission also sent the case before an ALJ, saying 
the case raised larger questions of market power. According to 
FERC, certain disputed issues of fact need to be examined at a 
hearing before a decision can be rendered.
     One of the biggest issues will be determining whether the 
affected market is the entire state of California or whether it is 
just Southern California. The CPUC and Southern California Edison 
maintain that only the Southern California market is at issue, 
while El Paso argues that the case applies to the entire state.
     The outcome of the case could hinge on that distinction. As 
Wagner noted in his opening remarks, ""The question of the 
geographic market makes a tremendous difference in how El Paso 
Merchant's market share will be measured and the results.""
     If the entire state is considered as a single market, said 
Wagner, then El Paso Merchant would have a market share that, 
depending on methodology, would range between 17% and 26.8%. 
But if the CPUC's contention that the market is Southern 
California holds up, he added, then El Paso Merchant's market 
share would be between 35% and 44.9%.
     Finding out whether market power exists also depends on how 
many players are involved in a particular market. Wagner said 
that the parties need to reach a stipulation among counsel on the 
number of players. In addition, he said that he would need a better 
geographic description of El Paso Merchant's capacity holdings 
and information on the price differential of gas between Northern 
and Southern California. 
     Finally, Wagner directed a number of questions to El Paso. El 
Paso Merchant, he said, ""should answer the CPUC's question as to 
why it subscribed for the involved [1.2 billion cfd] for 15 months 
when it had no market for that amount."" In addition, said Wagner, 
El Paso should ""show whether it sold in the secondary market 
short-term releases of the excess [capacity] at a price higher than 
it paid.""
     Wagner also heard arguments over the admissibility of certain 
evidence.
     Given the volume of testimony involved, the case will require 
some legal heavy lifting before a preliminary decision is reached. 
Noting that he received a nearly two-foot high stack of testimony 
last week, Wagner said that reading prehearing briefs and 
prepared testimony ""consumed a very beautiful Sunday in 
Washington."" (RP00-241)     NH

***El Paso takes aim at Calif. Assembly, study
     In an effort to clear its name in the ongoing California market 
power controversy, El Paso is going on the offensive. The company 
yesterday issued a riposte to claims -- publicized by California 
Assembly members and major newspapers -- that it manipulated 
California gas prices. And it took close aim at The Brattle Group, a 
consultancy that has figured prominently in various 
investigations into the matter. 
     According to El Paso, The Brattle Group worked ""hand-in-hand"" 
with a California Assembly subcommittee to pin the blame on El 
Paso and its subsidiaries for the run-up in gas prices in the 
Golden State. El Paso furnished copies of internal Assembly e-mails 
as proof that the subcommittee did not seek to conduct an 
objective investigation. 
     As reported in Gas Daily, The Brattle Group's study of alleged 
market power abuse by El Paso marketing arm El Paso Merchant 
Energy has been exhibit A in California pipeline litigation (GD 
4/25). In a study commissioned by Southern California Edison, The 
Brattle Group concluded that El Paso had deliberately manipulated 
California-bound pipeline capacity in an effort to drive up the 
price differential between production basins and the California 
border.
     Drawing in large part on The Brattle Group's opinion, the 
California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight recently 
concluded that El Paso caused the price run-up (GD 4/20). 
Representatives of the Assembly's Democratic majority said The 
Brattle Group study proved conclusively that the rise in gas 
prices at the California border was greater than could be 
accounted for through normal market forces.
     But according to El Paso, the subcommittee majority was -- 
deliberately -- wrong. The inquiry conducted by the subcommittee, 
said El Paso, was a ""charade that was orchestrated from the 
beginning"" to shore up SoCalEd's case.
     ""El Paso has recently obtained, through discovery in a 
proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
correspondence between the staff for the subcommittee and the 
paid litigation consultant [The Brattle Group] for Southern 
California Edison,"" said El Paso in a statement. ""This 
communication reveals that the subcommittee majority's 
conclusions were pre-determined to blame El Paso for California's 
failed energy policies.""
     The correspondence included apparent requests from 
subcommittee staff members for help in ""rebutting"" El Paso's 
testimony before the Assembly. El Paso interpreted those requests 
as proof that the subcommittee majority ""never intended"" to write 
an objective report on the matter. 
     ""We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its 
responsibilities to [SoCalEd's] consultants,"" said Norma Dunn, El 
Paso senior vice president of communications and government 
affairs. ""We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified 
before the subcommittee in good faith, under the false premise 
that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth. Now we 
learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of 
[SoCalEd's] litigation consultants to support SCE's litigation 
position."" 
     Litigation pitting SoCalEd and the California Public Utilities 
Commission against El Paso is currently under way at FERC (see 
story, page 1). Following yesterday's hearing, Dunn told Gas Daily 
that SoCalEd and the CPUC were also waging their campaign against 
El Paso in the   national press. 
     The New York Times, for instance, has published articles that 
relied on The Brattle Group study and other sealed documents. 
Dunn said it was ""clear"" that SoCalEd and the CPUC were using the 
selective leak of documents to take the case against El Paso to the 
public. 
     Prior to recess in yesterday's hearing, FERC Chief 
Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner issued a reminder of the 
need to restrict access to protected documents.     NH

El Paso Calls California Subcommittee Hearing a 'Sham' 
El Paso Corp. claims it was set up by California Assembly members to take the 
blame for high gas prices in the state. It said recent hearings before a 
subcommittee were a ""sham,"" and that it was ""predetermined"" that El Paso 
would be accused on wrongdoing in a report approved by the subcommittee 
majority yesterday. 
While El Paso battled similar accusations at the opening of hearings 
yesterday before a FERC administrative law judge, the company publicly 
contested the results of the majority report (approved 3-2) of the California 
Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight, which placed the blame on the 
energy company for skyrocketing gas prices in the state. The majority report 
says El Paso drove up gas prices by withholding pipeline capacity from the 
market, focusing on the same year-old capacity contract between El Paso's 
pipeline and marketing affiliate that is the subject of FERC's investigation. 
Contrary to the majority report, however, are the conclusions of a report 
prepared for the two Republican members of the five-member subcommittee. That 
document said the hearings ""produced no conclusive evidence"" of price 
manipulation. 
Although the majority report has not been made public, ""it is clear, based on 
accounts of the report and recently uncovered documents, that the 
subcommittee hearing was a sham,"" El Paso said in a statement. 
El Paso released to the public yesterday documents containing e-mail 
correspondence between staff members of the subcommittee and members of the 
Brattle Group, a paid consulting firm for Southern California Edison. The 
Brattle Group is one of El Paso's main opponents at the hearings this week 
before FERC's Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. Brattle 
accuses the company of costing Californians an additional $3.7 billion in gas 
costs over the past year. 
The correspondence El Paso released reveals a close relationship between the 
consulting firm and the subcommittee staff. For example, a staff member said 
to Brattle Group's Matthew O'Loughlin, ""I can't thank you and Paul enough for 
your testimony. It was beyond expectations, the members were highly 
impressed. The chairman asked me if you guys could stay and help us with a 
second day. We could have used it."" 
El Paso said the communication reveals that the subcommittee majority's 
conclusions were ""pre-determined to blame El Paso for California's failed 
energy policies."" The subcommittee majority was working ""hand-in-hand with, 
and relying on, SCE's consultant, the Brattle Group, in their so-called 
analysis,"" El Paso said. ""In communications between the subcommittee staff 
and SCE's consultant, it is clear that SCE's consultant assisted in preparing 
questions for the hearing and that the subcommittee staff requested 
assistance from SCE's consultant in preparing the final report. 
""That the subcommittee majority never intended to conduct an objective 
investigation is clear... [R]ather than write an objective report based on 
the testimony, the staff went on to ask SCE's consultant for help in 
'rebutting' El Paso's testimony."" 
""We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SCE's 
consultants,"" said Norma Dunn, senior vice president of Communications and 
Government Affairs for El Paso. ""We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff 
and testified before the subcommittee in good faith, under the false premise 
that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth. Now we learn that 
the subcommittee was working at the direction of SCE's litigation consultants 
to support SCE's litigation position. We are particularly concerned that 
after coordinating the questions to be asked, the Brattle Group testified 
before the subcommittee as if it were an independent group. It is obvious 
that the subcommittee hearings were a charade that was orchestrated from the 
beginning. Final conclusions were drawn before we had an opportunity to 
testify and then the final report was leaked to the press instead of provided 
to us, so that we would not have an opportunity to react."" 
Dunn said El Paso is confident that once the facts are presented to FERC in 
hearings this week, it will be ""vindicated."" 
However, El Paso also faces an uphill battle in Washington. The FERC hearings 
pit El Paso and its subsidiaries against the California Public Utilities 
Commission and the state's two largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas 
& Electric and Southern California Edison. 
The regulators and the utilities also allege El Paso withheld capacity on its 
pipelines into the state, which in turn pushed prices up. If the charges are 
substantiated, FERC Judge Wagner could order the company to refund any money 
it earned due to price or supply manipulation. Such a ruling could have even 
broader implications because skyrocketing prices for natural gas, the single 
biggest source of fuel for power plants in California, obviously contributed 
to the financial calamity that brought Southern California Edison to its 
knees and sent Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. 
The details of the charges are well known at this point. Critics alleged that 
El Paso Merchant Energy Gas LP and El Paso Merchant Energy Co. received 
inside information on a discount transportation rate that enabled them to end 
up the big winners in an open season in February of last year. The open 
season involved 1.22 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso to the California 
border. 
But in an order on complaint, FERC found ""no merit in the allegations."" It 
cleared El Paso of charges that it rigged the bidding for capacity to favor 
its affiliates. Moreover, it said there was no evidence that El Paso violated 
its standards of conduct. However, the Commission did not dismiss the 
allegations that El Paso engaged in market and price manipulation. It set the 
market power issue for hearing in March before Judge Wagner and ordered him 
to provide an initial decision within 60 days (see Daily GPI, March 29). 
FERC staff also appears to be hot on El Paso's tracks. In testimony submitted 
last week before Judge Wagner, FERC staff's expert witness concluded that El 
Paso probably exercised market power in the Southern California gas market 
and drove up gas prices over the past year when pipeline capacity constraints 
existed. FERC Economist Dr. Jonathan D. Ogur concluded that under certain 
circumstances El Paso was able to wield market power in the Southern 
California gas market (see Daily GPI, May 14). 
The rise in California natural gas prices is not attributable to El Paso, the 
company said in its statement yesterday, but is attributable to the fact that 
demand for gas has far outstripped supply. Evidence presented at the 
California subcommittee hearings shows that El Paso has consistently utilized 
its pipeline capacity to ship natural gas to California and has never 
restricted supply. Constraints on gas infrastructure in the state have 
limited the supply of gas during a time in which demand has risen 
dramatically, the company said.

Poland's SOK in limbo as Belchatow withdraws

Will Poland's long-awaited transition levy scheme to dissolve long-term power 
purchase agreement's (PPAs) - System Oplat Kompensacyjnych (SOK) - see the 
light of day? This has become one of the burning issues in central European 
electricity deregulation ever since the first draft was published in April 
2000. Subject to perennial delays and uncertainties surrounding its 
implementation as well as criticism from generators and banks, SOK has become 
the laughing stock of Polish power reform. This is a pity for it holds the 
key to price and regulatory transparency, as well as the proper functioning 
of the Polish Power Exchange (Gielda Energii) as its head, Jan Buczkowski, 
never ceases to point out.

SOK's credibility has been dented by the decision of Elektrownia Belchatow, 
Poland's largest and most fuel-efficient generator and the linchpin to a 
competitive power market, to exclude itself from the first group of producers 
to be covered by the scheme. Belchatow, along with Elektrownia Opole and 
Elektrownia Jaworzno III, were to start dissolving their PPAs on 15 April. 
But Belchatow, afraid that if it joined SOK its financial condition would 
worsen considerably since it would be paying in to the system instead of 
receiving payments, is not renegotiating its PPA with state grid PSE. Unless 
the plant is able to rid itself of its punitive below-market contract, which 
relieves it of its low-cost advantage, the prospects for a competitive power 
market are dim.
Opole and Jaworzno hope for 1 July
In an article in the daily Puls Biznesu on 2 May, representatives from Opole, 
Jaworzno III and Elektrownia Dolna Odra (which has taken the place of 
Belchatow) are quoted as saying that they are optimistic that they will be 
able to start phasing out their long-term contracts on 1 July. But investors 
have heard it all before. SOK was supposed to be implemented in the 
second-half of last year, then in the first-half of this year, and now it's 
questionable whether the 1 July deadline is realistic. All this creates 
uncertainty. 
""This is what investors hate the most. What's more, it's extremely difficult 
to estimate the effects of SOK given that there isn't any historical 
precedent,"" Puls quotes Piotr Samojlik, general director of financial 
advisers CAIB in Warsaw, as saying. But even a botched SOK, many believe, is 
better than a dead SOK.
One of the stumbling blocks concerns the ministry of finance's reservations 
regarding the calculation of VAT in the payments. Apparently, this has yet to 
be addressed. But Puls quotes Jozef Pekala, the president of Opole, as saying 
that his plant and PSE have already reached a tentative agreement on the 
model of the annex to the PPA and are now awaiting the final text. All 
Opole's units are under a long-term contract set to expire in 2012 and worth 
an estimated ZL5bn. 
Jan Kurp, meanwhile, the high-powered president of Jaworzno III (who also 
doubles as head of the mammoth Poludniowy Koncern Energetyczny), is also 
upbeat and hopes to close negotiations by the end of this month. The 
following month will be devoted to talks with the banks, Kurp tells Puls. 
Jaworzno has a long-term contract set to expire in 2008 and a smaller 
contract (covering 12-15% of capacity) expiring in 2012.
Juchniewicz ready to free prices
On 10 May, Leszek Juchniewicz, the head of Poland's energy watchdog URE, 
confirmed he would stick to his July plans to exempt generators from the 
obligation to submit tariffs for approval despite the distinct likelihood of 
a continuation of the PPA regime. This is one of the few pieces of good news 
that has come out of the Polish power sector for some time and will be 
greeted positively by investors. In an address to parliamentarians, 
Juchniewicz said that while wholesale prices will be freed, retail prices 
will, for the time being, be capped in order to protect small and 
medium-sized consumers. 
SOK's fate, however, ultimately rests with the banks and the plants who, for 
a variety of reasons, are not particularly enthusiastic about the programme 
and have serious doubts whether the issue of stranded costs can be resolved 
in a fair manner. With parliamentary elections looming, it is vital that SOK 
be implemented as quickly as possible in order for there to be no 
backtracking and/or revisions after the elections.

2564,"Mike:

I regret that we had a difficult call yesterday.   We greatly appreciate the 
good work that you do and the commitment you and your firm have to our 
company.  Moreover, I recognize that the legislature is a difficult 
environment and that there is substantial pressure on you and Sandy.  I also 
recognize that needs and demands can change quickly and, at times, our RCR 
process can be difficult!

All that said, however, the Government Affairs group has an obligation to use 
our internal and external resources in the best and most cost-effective 
manner.  The RCR process helps us satisfy that obligation..  

From our conversation yesterday and a later call with Sandy, it appears that 
there is some confusion on how we will use the RCR process to contract for 
legal support for our legislative efforts.  Hopefully this e-mail will 
clarify the process so there is no confusion in the future and so that you 
can feel comfortable you are undertaking work that is authorized and for 
which we have a budget.

1.  To begin, it appears from your e-mail yesterday that Goodin, MacBride has 
billings as of May 11 for approximately $10,000 on direct access, windfall 
profits, the ""Global Settlement,"" and Power Plant Siting.  With respect to 
this work, I recognize that there may have been confusion about our budgeting 
and RCR approval process.  These billings will be included in the 
RCR-approval requests discussed below.  

2As we discussed yesterday, the work associated with the billings in May was 
conducted without any RCR approval or any budget in place.  As you know we 
terminated the two legislative retainers at the end of April.  No RCRs were 
filed to cover the matters on which work was completed in May.    

I did receive a budget on legislative matters on May 8.  However, a decision 
was made only yesterday to proceed on a specific matter-by-matter basis.  The 
work in May should not have been undertaken while we considered whether to 
proceed with an overall legislative budget or proceed with specific RCRs.  In 
short, the proposed budget was not RCR approval.  

In the future, any work undertaken by Goodin MacBride should only be 
conducted pursuant to an approved RCR.  If an emergency arises--i.e., an 
issue arises that could not have been contemplated, we can get emergency 
approval for work necessary to respond to the emergency.   Please contact me 
in the event of an emergency.  I can be reached through my office 
line--503.464.7945, pager--888.916.2262, or cell phone 503.539.4733.  If I 
can't be reached, please contact Jim Steffes.  Jim's pager number is 
888.906.9676.  Note that both Jim and I wear the pager at all times and 
respond immediately to messages left on the pager.  

3.  Pending RCR approval for the matters identified below, I have asked 
Goodin MacBride to participate in the Direct Access coalition meetings taking 
place today and tomorrow.  In a discussion with Sandy yesterday, I agreed 
that Goodin MacBride should participate in a telephonic conference on the 
Calderon bill.  

4.  To the maximum extent possible, you should include Leslie Lawner in 
future Direct Access Coalition meetings, conference calls, legislative 
drafting efforts, etc.  

5.  If there is any confusion on whether there is RCR approval for a 
particular matter, please contact me before undertaking an assignment.  If I 
am unavailable, please contact Jim Steffes.   

6.  Today, Sandy is filing several RCRs for legislative support on Direct 
Access, Siting, Windfalls Profits, and the Global Settlement.  They will be 
considered at next Monday's RCR conference call.  If they are approved, Sandy 
will manage the Goodin MacBride assignments associated with Direct Access, 
Siting, and Windfalls Profits.  

7.  Jeff Dasovich will manage all work associated with the Global Settlement, 
whether it is legislative or not.  This does not mean that Sandy cannot give 
assignments to Goodin MacBride that involve the Global Settlement; it simply 
means that before that work begins Jeff must approve the work.  

This particular issue is a critical matter for our company.  Jeff is involved 
in the strategy and business calls concerning this matter and is working on a 
daily basis with Jim Steffes, Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean to develop our 
position and advocate that position in the settlement discussions.  We must 
ensure that our Sacramento efforts are fully coordinated with our strategy 
and business interests (as they develop through the settlement 
discussions).   To avoid any confusion on the scope of Jeff's responsibility, 
I consider all legislation addressing the Edison MOU, any future MOUs with 
Sempra, and ""Plan B,"" to be part of the Global Settlement.  

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  
Again, we appreciate your hard work and commitment to our efforts.

I haven't been formally introduced to you, although I have seen you several 
times in the Houston offsites.  In the past 16 months, I have been working in 
Government and Regulatory Affairs group covering EBS global telecommunication 
issues.  Currently,  I am on secondment in London to help Jan Haizmann with 
European and Asian telecommunication licensing procedures. This September, I 
will be starting the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies 
(SAIS) master program in Washington DC.  I have a strong interest in staying 
with the government affairs group and believe that a part time position in 
the Enron DC office will be complementary to my studies at SAIS. Rick Shapiro 
encouraged me to contact you directly, suggesting that you might be willing 
to meet with me and to help me identify the employment opportunities in the 
DC office.

It may be helpful for you to know that I have been working for the past two 
year for Enron. While in Houston, I had the chance to work on number of 
interesting projects, including providing financial modeling support for the 
former Enron International group.  I am familiar with deregulation process, 
especially with the recent developments in the telecommunication field.   In 
addition, working in the London office have provided me with the opportunity 
to working with the EU Commission, the UK Parliament and other lobbying 
groups.  I believe that my experience in Enron will enable me to play a 
proactive role in the DC office.   

I will be in touch with you by phone in a week.  Next month, I will be 
passing through DC & would like to set up a short 20-30 minute meeting with 
you at a mutually convenient time. 

I understand you are busy and appreciate your time. I look forward to talking 
with you soon.

2569,"I am advised that at yesterday's ISO Board meeting, the ISO announced that it 
would be filing with FERC today their circuit breaker proposal and tariff 
language under section 205 as required by FERC's Order last week granting the 
Mirant complaint, even though they will not have obtained ISO Committee 
approval of these documents. That approval, required for a 205 filing,  is 
anticipated to occur at the special meeting of the Management Committee 
that's been scheduled for May 23rd. My understanding is that the ISO intends 
to ask FERC to expedite approval of the circuit breaker plan and tariffs by 
June 13 but will not seek to have the circuit breaker applied prior to a 
final FERC ruling. 
IPPNY is likely to file tomorrow a response opposing the request for 
expedited treatment. We should oppose this request as well. Clearly, the ISO 
is making a mockery of FERC's remand of the circuit breaker back to the ISO 
to get approval and resolve a number of issues that had been raised by 
parties in the Mirant docket. However, those issues were only the tip of the 
iceberg, as most parties treated the Mirant complaint as a challenge to the 
ISO's authority to proceed without FERC approval and didn't raise substantive 
concerns with the specifics of the ISO's circuit breaker proposal when they 
filed in the Mirant docket. There are many such issues and parties thought 
they would get discussed in the Committee review process that FERC had 
clearly contemplated would occur. ",Mirant,,ISO Board ISO FERC Mirant ISO Committee the Management Committee IPPNY Committee

2571,"The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, issued a ruling today on the EPA Section 126 Rule.  (As brief background, the 126 Rule would have required compliance with more stringent summer-season NOx caps starting in May 2003 in several northeast and Midwest states)

The Order states:  

""It is Ordered that EPA's Section 126 Rule is remanded as to all cogenerators, but vacated only as to those cogenerators classified as electric generating units (""EGUs"") under the rule that supply equal to or less than one third of their potential capacity or equal to or less than 25 MW to the grid for sale per year.""   Translation:  This part of the order appears to ""vacate"" or completely throw out the 126 rule for small cogen units (under 25 MW) or cogen units selling less than 1/3 into the grid.   For all other cogenerators, the court remands the rule to EPA for re-working, consistent with some of the court's earlier objections about EPA's handling of cogens.   Impact:  EPA will need to go back and formulate rules for cogens altogether, so there is currently no NOx compliance schedule in place for cogen units.   EPA will need to start from scratch for smaller cogens.

""It is Further ordered that as of May 15, 2001, the date of this court's decision, the three-year compliance period for emissions limitations applicable to EGUs under the Section 126 Rule is tolled, pending EPA's resolution of the remand of EGU growth factors ordered by this court.""  Translation:  This more significant part of the order ""tolls"" -- or puts on hold -- compliance with the 126 Rule for ALL ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGUs) until EPA resolves EGU growth factor issues that the court identified in its May 15, 2001 ruling.     

Impact:  The practical effect of this part of the order will be to delay implementation of the Section 126 Rule until May 2004, when the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulation is scheduled to go into effect.   The EPA will not be able to re-issue its Section 126 rules in a time frame that would require compliance before May 2004.  The NOx SIP Call would have supplanted the Section 126 Rule in May 2004 anyway -- what this ruling does is take away some of the uncertainty that existed for the May to September 2003 period (original effective date of the Section 126).   This means that generators in states not covered already by existing NOx trading programs (OTR NOx program) will have another year to comply.

I will forward any more detailed legal analysis as I receive it, but this is the latest news.

Please call if you have any questions.

some German and Dutch power issues on which Paul H/ Teun/ I can brief you. 
Also a chance to go over the most egregious barriers to entry on the gas 
side, which Doug will no doubt guide you on. So here's my idea for an agenda 
to be sent to Ristori in advance:
 1. Belgian power - status of Commission infringement action - our experience 
of continuing closure of market, inability to transit power - inaction of 
CREG.
 2. French power - forthcoming VPP auctions - our experience with border 
transmission capacity auctions and ex post border congestion charges - 
arguments about ""reciprocity"" vis a vis neighbouring Member States.
 3. NL borders LT transmission capacity reservations - still distorting power 
market - principle of ATC netting.
 4. German export and import related power transmission tariffs - status of 
Commission discussions with German government post Florence?
 5. German gas TPA.
 6. French gas TPA.
 7. Madrid process - forthcoming June meeting.
 8. Progress of Commission's liberalisation acceleration proposals - outcome 
of Energy Council and plans for parliamentary debates.
 9. Ten minutes from Rick of ""California power crisis 101"".

Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard.

We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates.

On transparency, Leon understands our concerns.  In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information.  We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC.  We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form.  We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute.

Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections.  This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff.  (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler).

Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind.  Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under ""information required"" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows:

(2)  each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.

The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy.  By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc.

As to the ""timely basis"" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day.  If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily.  That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think.  Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway:

""(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate.

The change is to add ""appropriate"" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable.  The use of ""appropriate"" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like ""consistent with ..."" or ""promote competition"" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability.  There should be some valid purpose established before data is released.  I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate.

Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill.

Will provide a further report on market-based rates.  In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments.  We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.",Linda Leon Lowery Bingaman Leon Sam Fowler,,FERC sec FPA Hill Enron

Thanks for the input.  Attached is the current version of the data to
support the PUCT filing.  I have had a couple conversations with Richard
Greffe of PUCT staff regarding the requirements of 25.401 and plan to walk
him thru the backup workpapers by the end of the month to get any
suggestions.  I did mention to Chairman Yzaguirre at a meeting earlier this
week that we might be bringing a filing to the Commission but that it was
just at the notice threshold--will  mention, as well,  to the other two
Commissioners in meetings next week.  While we could possibly play with the
numbers and/or timing of the filing to get below the 1% threshold, my
inclination is to make a simple informational filing out of an abundance of
caution and to create good will.

""I am pleased to announce some organisational changes to the European Government and Regulatory Affairs Group.  Paul Dawson will become head of the group taking responsibility for government and regulatory affairs across continental Europe in addition to his current UK responibilities.   Paul will report directly to myself and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood (Continental Gas), Peter Styles (EU and Continental Power) and Paul Hennemeyer (German speaking countries).  Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group with Rick Shapiro continuing to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function.

I believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe

etc

Hope this is OK for a general announcement - not sure there is much more to say to the wider audience without dwelling on justifications and the finer points of how the respective responsibilities will pan out.  Clearly, however, a bit more explanation will be required for some individuals and the team as a whole.

Let know if you manage to get hold of Michael, re, my telling Doug.  If possible, I'd like to be able to discuss this with him sooner rather than later.

These purpose of the compiled information is to determine which project should on the tope of the list to provide regulatory coverage.  The compiled information may include the following: 
a)	Determine the nature of the generation asset (e.g., acquisition, new?etc.),.
b)	Determine the nature of the Customer (e.g. transmission customer, distribution customer, PPA)
c)	Determine the coverage of the regulatory coverage needed (which jurisdiction the transaction is subject to).
d)	Determine the different market components on which the transaction is dependent upon (e.g., which ISO, transmission system, which distribution system).

Congratulaions for Enron's active presence in this secondary market for 
energy quotas.

Now that Enron (and most of our potential clients in the future) is helping 
creating a [healthy] appetite for trading, let's make sure that some 
government bureaucrats do not screw up, and step away from market forces.  
(Particularly Mauro Arce, who has never been comfortable with economic 
signals - please refer to his interview in the press in the second week of 
May, where he was the first government official to publicly defend rolling 
black-outs as opposed to quotas with MAE prices). Industry players will 
likely put pressure on Aneel to have retail competition thresholds reduced to 
50 kW in 2003. So far, distribution companies have bitterly opposed to to it, 
under the [moot] assumption that most of the new PPAs will become stranded.

I am particularly concerned with Plan B, or whatever they call it in case 20% 
is not achieved/sufficient, which is being prepared by Mauro Arce. Let's keep 
an eye to make sure that Plan B is indeed perceived as a continuation, as 
opposed to a repudiation of market forces. If necessary, let's reduce quotas 
and increase the cost of deficit to R$ 2350/MWh (David  Rosenberg has great 
ideas on this), with a corresponding increase in the penalties for all 
customers.  The savings Brazil has achieved so far are far greater than what 
PROCEL has achieved in 20 years. This is not a criticism on PROCEL, but 
simply a testimony that market signals [in our particular case in tandem with 
perception of crises, instilled only on May 03]  do work. I had chance to 
exchange some ideas with A IBRD comission last week. They are on the very 
same boat to use economic signals, not only in 2001 but also throughout 
2002.  They even advocate to set quotas below the target rationing, to reduce 
the regulated segment of the market. 

The recent success on the hydro auction program also illustrates the point. 
Large customers have perceived that the old-fashioned strategy of keeping 
subsidies in the system is not sustainable. They would rather make the 
investment themselves and have the badly needed energy in place. The threat 
of high energy prices in 2003, when the initial contracts start to scale 
downand the prices are  expected  to skyrocket, is a great incentive for 
people (including customers) to invest in new generation (therefore reducing 
the impact of the crisis).  For this to happen, it is key that the government 
maintains the initial contracts, with NO regulated bulk tariffs after 2003. 
Bill of Law  2905 want to re-regulate energy. It is an over-reaction to the 
California syndrom and it would be a bad incentive for new contracting and 
expansion. The only way to make the self-fulfilling prophecy wrong is by 
giving NOW all the right incentives for expansion. The allegation of 
""protecting"" the customer does not hold.

Clear regulatory incentives, and no expectations of being bailed out is key 
for this to happen. It is part of the ""virtuous circle"". 

FYI, please find enclosed a recent presentation on ""virtuous contracting""- 
(and the maintenance of Initial Contracts is part of it), recently delivered 
at the Institute of the Americas. (Pedro Parente agrees with the concepts in 
there)...


... as well as a position paper from Abraceel (my last one) on why there 
should NOT be regulated tariffs after 2003 in excess to what is proposed by 
the Initial Contracts.  This paper is to be sent early next week to Deputy 
Aleluia, and Gazeta Mercantil will publish an article on Monday.

Judge Wagner issued a public Proposed Recommendation (the media was in the 
room) to resolve the matters before the Settlement process late Monday 
afternoon.

He initially talked about ""can bring a horse to water, but can't make him 
drink.""  

He went on to detail that the Suppliers had offered $716.1MM for Settlement 
($510MM for Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, Williams, Reliant + $125MM for Powerex + 
$49.6MM for 15 marketers + $6.5MM for 6 CMUA members + $25MM for outside 
Calif Utilities [includes PGE]).  He said thought refunds in the hundred of 
$millions or maybe $1billion were right.

His will propose the following method to the Commission.  

1. Retroactively apply the June 19 Order from Oct 2 - June 19.
2. Modify that decision to (a) use actual heat rates from marginal unit in 
NP15 and SP15, (b) use two daily gas prices - north CA and south CA, (c) 
incorporate NOx costs, (c) add a 10% credit premium.
3. Commission should hold an expedited 60 day hearing on matters relating to 
questions of material facts (Mwh sold, gas prices, etc).

He did indicate that his perspective was that the moneys owed could be offset 
against CAISO bills.

Importantly, we are unsure if the Judge will recommend to have FERC  (a) 
determine that upon the application of this refund Order the rates are 
determined to be J&R, (b) ensure that all buyers in these markets get similar 
refunds, (c) limit the refund to not include CDWR and CAISO Out-of-Market 
transactions.

We are intending to communicate with the Judge's staff tomorrow on these 
issues to seek clarity.

Finally, is it appropriate to have Charles River Associates attempt to 
calculate the refund liability?  We may want to understand the risk under 
different assumptions.

Market-Based Rates for Ancillary Services

 Pursuant to Order No. 888, companies with general market-based rate
authority must separately obtain market-based rate authority for ancillary
services.  See Order No. 888 at 31,720 quoting the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) as stating: ""The fact that we have authorized a utility to
sell wholesale power at market-based rates does not mean we have authorized
the utility to sell ancillary services at market-based rates.""  Accordingly,
an entity with market-based rate authority must make a separate showing with
regard to securing market-based rates for ancillary services.

 In markets that are currently administered by independent system
operators (""ISOs"") - i.e., the PJM Interconnection, LLC (""PJM""), the New
York ISO (""NYISO""), ISO-New England (""ISO-NE""), and the California ISO
(""Cal-ISO"") - the FERC has previously permitted entities with general
market-based rate authority to sell ancillary services in those markets to
the extent that it has authorized other suppliers to sell such ancillary
services.  See Canadian Niagara Power Co., Ltd., 87 FERC ? 61,070 (1999)
(authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into the
NYISO and ISO-NE markets); Minergy Neenah, L.L.C., et al., 88 FERC ? 61,102
(1999) (authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into
the NYISO); Atlantic City Elec. Co., et al., 86 FERC ? 61,039 (1999)
(authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into PJM);
PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., 91 FERC ? 61,021 (2000) (same); see also New

As a general proposition, companies that have sought authority to sell
ancillary services in these ISO markets have simply requested the blanket
authorization for sales of ancillary services.  Many companies have added
that they desire the authority to be extended to additional ancillary
services and geographic markets, as the FERC may specify and authorize in
the future in orders that extend such authority to all sellers previously
authorized to sell energy and/or capacity at market-based rates.  See Edison
Mission Mktg. and Trading, Docket No. ER99-2434-000 (unpublished delegated
letter order issued May 7, 1999).

 The authority to make sales of ancillary services at market-based
rates is not, merely, limited to only those markets were established by the
FERC with operating ISOs.  The criteria for seeking such authority in
non-ISO markets is found in the Avista case.  See Avista Corp., 87 FERC -
61,223, reh'g granted, 89 FERC - 61,136 (1999) (""Avista"").  The problem
associated with obtaining market-based rates for ancillary services in
non-ISO markets has centered on the difficulty (or impossibility) of
obtaining estimates of other suppliers' abilities to supply ancillary
services to support a reliable market analysis that demonstrates that the
entity seeking such authority does not have market power in the relevant
markets for ancillary services.  However, in the Avista case, the FERC
authorized the provision of Regulation and Frequency Response, Energy
Imbalance, Operating Reserve - Spinning Reserve Service, and Operating
Reserve - Supplemental Reserve Service at market-based rates in non-ISO
markets with certain conditions.

 The Avista conditions require the Company to consider: (1) the
establishment of an internet site that provides information on, and
conducts, ancillary services transactions; (2) the posting on the internet
site of the offering prices of all available services; and (3) the ability
of customers to request services and make bids for those services using the
site.  Moreover, the entity must file with the FERC one year after the
internet site is operational, and at least three years thereafter, a report
describing its activities in the relevant ancillary services markets.  The
entity must also commit not to sell ancillary services at market-based rates
to:  (i) regional transmission organizations (""RTOs"") such as an ISO or
transco, i.e., where the RTO has no ability to self-supply ancillary
services but instead depends on third parties; (ii) a traditional franchised
public utility affiliated with the entity, or sales where the underlying
transmission is on the system of a public utility affiliated with the
entity; or (iii) a public utility that is purchasing ancillary services to
satisfy its own open access transmission tariff requirements to offer
ancillary services to its own customers.  Id. at 61,833, note 12.

 The terms and conditions associated with the provision of ancillary
services at market-based rates must be included in the market-based rate
schedule filed with the FERC and address the limitations on that authority
as discussed above.  For entities which have already obtained general
market-based rate authority, an amendment could be filed in their underlying
market-based rate dockets before the FERC seeking the authority to also sell
ancillary services at market-based rates consistent with the referenced FERC
precedent.

I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who asked me to let you know that he 
will send you a check in the amount of $200.  

While Jeff would probably be to modest to tell you himself, I thought you 
might be interested to know that he has been named the National MS Society's 
2000 Man of the Year, and will be honored at a dinner on September 30.  He 
has been a big supporter of the MS Society, primarily through his riding the 
MS150 from Houston to Austin since 1997.  This year's ride is April 15-16, 
and he has been busy collecting pledges - $20,000 so far, which will be 
matched by the Enron dollar-for-dollar.  Enron Corp. has the largest MS150 
team in the nation in terms of dollars raised, and this year our goal is 
$350,000.  It appears that our 378-person team has already blown through that 
goal and is well on its way to raising $400,000.  As MS has touched my 
family, I am very proud to be associated with a man and a company who so 
actively support research to find a cure.

I'm sure Jeff will write a personal note when he returns to town and sends 
his check.  In the meantime, good luck with your fund raising, and have a

'Tonight Show' pokes fun at power crisis 
 
By Fred Shuster
Staff Writer 
 
BURBANK -- Jay Leno pulled the plug on his late-night chat show Thursday, doing his part for the state's energy crisis, but viewers weren't left in the dark. 
Flashlights, mining helmets and multicolor glow sticks helped to illuminate the set for the show dubbed a one-time-only ""The Tonight Show Unplugged,"" which Leno said saved enough electricity to light a house for a month. 
 [IMAGE] 	
 The ""unplugged"" edition of ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" pokes fun at the California power crisis(Reed Saxon / A.P.) 	


Call it NBC's ""Can't See TV."" 
""This is not some cheap rating ploy. ... If this works, they're gonna make us do this every night,"" Leno joked as part of his opening monologue. 
The nationally broadcast show, featuring a comic interlude with California Gov. Gray Davis, utilized just a small amount of electricity to run the cameras, Leno said before the show began. 
Actually, in Burbank, where the taping took place at NBC Studios, the city owns the power company and residents and businesses have not been hit by rolling blackouts as in other areas. The city made $5 million in profit in May after racking up $60 million in excess power sales. 
But Leno said not using studio lights, TV monitors, amplifiers and other power sources Thursday saved enough electricity to light a four-bedroom house for a month. 
Members of the house band wore miner's helmets, with group leader Kevin Eubanks strumming an acoustic guitar rather than his regular electric instrument. 
The stage was lit by candles, torches and flashlight beams trained on Leno. Members of the studio audience used the gear to help brighten the set. 
""This is real goofy,"" Leno said before taping got under way. ""We'll see what happens."" Guests included Arsenio Hall, Gilbert Gottfried, a trainer of nocturnal animals and a Hawaiian fire dancer -- and a brief visit from the governor. 
Exuding whatever is the direct opposite of charisma, Davis had a brief exchange with Leno, drawing laughs with the line, ""This is the first time Gray Davis and (the word) electricity have ever appeared in the same sentence."" 
Leno's staff wore glasses with small lights attached and audience prompter Bob Perlow held a hand-scrawled applause sign aloft throughout the show instead of switching on the usual electric model. 
While there was little energy in play, there was no shortage of laughs. 
Leno joked that President George W. Bush told Davis not to worry because, ""I've been operating in the dark for years."" 
Those in the studio said Leno's nocturnal transmission added excitement to the program. 
""It was cool,"" said Lillie Harrell, 17, a tourist from Hammond, La. ""The crowd got really involved. I guess it shows you don't really need all those lights."" 
Added Jose Tano, 21, a Burbank resident and student at the University of California, Los Angeles, ""It was a good idea and a great way to make a point."" 
The local power company might not have made out very well, but the studio audience didn't end up empty-handed. Each received a fluorescent lantern and pack of batteries as they left the studio.

I have been an employee of EBS for just about one year.
I relocated from New York City, where I had lived and worked all of my life. The reason I made the move to Enron and Houston was the ""opportunity and growth"" that EBS was going to provide. I sold my home, left my job at AT&T of 18 years and uprooted my family and bought a home in Houston.
I enjoyed my various jobs at EBS very much and felt as though I have made a strong contribution to EBS.
Yet, I have been told that my position is no longer needed and have been placed in the redeployment program. I have had no opportunities presented to me within Enron or EBS during the past 30 days. I have 15 days to find a job.  My family is very upset and worried.

This is disturbing.  I can not understand how an HR employee for an Enron 
business unit can deny access to what appears to be an Enron auditor on the 
grounds that the records being sought are confidential.  As you know Sanjay 
reports to both Ken and myself in support of EBS Asia activities as well as I 
believe McDonald for Global Assets.  Given this split accountability, and the 
fact that I do not know which business unit these records apply to, you as a 
representative of Corp should probably require that Enron be given access to 
these records as part of your audit responsibilities.  If you think it 
appropriate for me to make the request I will be happy to do so.

 Verliant, Inc.
  <<...>>
 Corporations today are confronted with a myriad of laws and
regulations from Federal, State and Local governments. Complying with these
regulations costs companies billions of dollars annually, in direct
compliance costs alone.   Furthermore, the risk of non-compliance is
significant and costs companies both directly, in terms of fines and
litigation, and indirectly in terms of increased insurance premiums.  OSHA,
which is only one of several compliance categories, estimates that companies
spend over $67 million annually--in fines alone.   Litigation and settlement
can cost multiples of the government fines.  Verliant has developed a
web-based, artificial intelligence tool that helps companies maintain
regulatory compliance and successfully manage operational risks. The initial
product focuses on compliance in environmental, health, safety and training.
The technology is developed and has completed a successful beta test with
its first client, Allied Waste Corporation. Contracts have been signed with
initial revenues to occur in January 2001.

 Technology & Product
  * U.S. employers face a multitude of onerous record
keeping and compliance responsibilities. The administrative burden of
maintaining up to date knowledge of, and complying with, regulatory
requirements is significant.
  * Verliant automates key management compliance
processes that were previously ignored or handled manually by employers' HR,
Safety or Legal departments.  Employers recognize significant cost savings
in compliance and substantial decreases in non-compliance.  Likewise,
productivity and the effectiveness of safety programs are enhanced.
  * Applications modules include: Human Resources
(Employee Record Management); Healthcare Compliance Auditing; Medical
Surveillance; Substance Abuse Program Tracking; Training, Evaluation and
Endorsement Tracking; DOT Driver Qualification File Maintenance; Event
Management; Accident and Injury Reporting, Tracking and Analysis; and
Industrial Hygiene.

 Market
  * There are over 6.5 million American firms that must
comply with regulatory standards.
  * OSHA estimates annual compliance costs at $33
billion.

 Marketing Strategy
  * Initial focus will be through direct sales to
Fortune 2000 companies.
  * Pricing is based on a monthly fee of about $2 per
employee.
  * Verliant has signed contracts with Allied Waste and
San-i-Pak.
  * The company plans to implement multi-tiered, direct
sales, distribution model supplemented by resellers with substantial
existing presence within niche target markets.  The company is negotiating
agreements with several resellers in both the medical and waste management
industries.

 Competition
  * Verliant has identified two direct competitors. The
first is Medgate, a privately held Canadian company that offers several
competing modules, but is not yet internet-based. The second is Complient,
which is in development of an internet-based compliance solution,
supplemented by training and safety product sales.
  * Other companies such as J.J. Keller, a privately
held company focused on the Department of Transportation (DOT) solution
only, is not internet-based.
  * A more distant competitor is PureSafety.com, which
focuses only on OSHA Training Tools.
  * Verliant is developing strategic relationships and
marketing alliances with several companies in the medical, waste management,
and PEO industries.

 Competitive Advantages
  * Management Team - The Company's executive management
skills, domain expertise, market knowledge, distribution channels,
intellectual property, and price versus performance are one of its greatest
strengths.
  * Superior Functionality - No competitors offer
Verliant's comprehensive suite of compliance rule-based solutions, on-line
document imaging, or full-service data entry and date loading.
  * ASP Delivery Model - The advantages of the ASP
include easy to use Internet based solutions, proprietary compliance rules
algorithms, and flexible reporting functions.
  * Brand Leadership - The Company's competitive
strategy will be based upon building brand awareness by virtue of its
expertise and the founder's reputation in the occupational health and safety
industry.

 Organizational Information
  Management Team

I have not confirmed that these are the correct values, but this should get you started.  These are based on Socal's published long-term storage tariff.  I cannot confirm whether Socal has capacity at these rates available to sell.  Keep in mind I don't think the LNG project would incur the entire cost of the storage, as ENA could extract additional value from optimizing its operation.  It appears the cost is quite sensitive to the winter withdrawal rights, which I do not see any way around unless we can unload more of the cargo directly into the system and bypass the storage facility during the winter.  Please do not hesitate to call with any questions.

Mat


 ",Jody,,Socal LNG ENA
2706,"Chris,

Per our conversation, the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track/compute/report, etc.


Background

The west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports.  These balances are not reported by the respective pipelines, however, each day the injections and withdrawals are available.  In the past, our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior day's balance.  As we get validation of the balances through phone calls, and/or postings, we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation.  Currently, our reporting/storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports.

Task

Synthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table.  It is our intent to have a DRN established (and some already have been created) that would hold the storage balance each day.  However, this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database.  One possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped.  Another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report, while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity.  Lastly, these storage balances could be manual entry points, but would require manual calculation each day (representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature).

Timeline

This is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets.  At a minimum, we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week.  Although, we do not have a final date for transitioning, we see this as one of a few critical tasks.

Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update4)

     (Updates with Chief Financial Officer Fastow didn't
immediately return a call for comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares have
fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest
energy trader's dealings with partnerships run by its chief
financial officer contributed to investment losses.

     Enron's stock dropped 10 percent today. Enron's board cost
the company at least $35 million by allowing Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to manage LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,
partnerships that bought Enron assets, a shareholder alleged
Wednesday in a lawsuit.

     The lawsuit came the day after Enron reported $1.01 billion
in third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall Street
Journal reported $35 million of the losses were connected with the
two limited partnerships. Enron also reduced shareholders' equity
by $1.2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the
partnerships, the paper reported yesterday.

     ``It looks sleazy,'' said Roger Hamilton, a manager at John
Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares. ``If you are
someone who invests in a company's management, it's almost time to
punt with Enron.''

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't return calls or written
requests seeking comment. Fastow didn't immediately return a
telephone call for comment.

     Fastow and a handful of associates made more than $7 million
last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital
increases on an investment of about $3 million in one of the
partnerships, the Journal reported today.

                        Buying Enron Assets

     Fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and
partnerships that appear to have ties to Houston-based Enron,
based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.

     The foreign business corporations and limited liability
companies have directors, officers or managers whose address is
listed as 1400 Smith Street in Houston, Enron's corporate address,
according to Texas records.

     Fastow is listed as a director, officer or managing member in
each one. At least one of the companies bought and sold Enron
assets, including foreign power plants.

     Whitewing Management, which lists Fastow as its managing
member, received $807 million from the sale of Enron debt last
year.

    Under the terms of the debt sale, Whitewing is allowed to use
the proceeds to buy power plants from Enron or make other
``permitted investments.'' Whitewing has bought 14 Enron plants or
companies since 1999 and sold four.

     Enron's Denne has not responded to written requests about
Fastow's role at Whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the
value of Enron assets to benefit outside investors or company
executives at Enron's expense.

     Shares of Enron fell $2.95 to $26.05. They have fallen
69 percent this year.

2757,"The state of transmission/transportation regulation here is continually evolving and a full treatment would qualify for an economics doctorate.  You should also be aware that not everything out of Ofgem (the UK regulator) makes sense.   Hence, while I've provided some answers to your specific questions below, I would see these only as broad guides to the issues you are facing in the US and would retain a healthy degree of scepticism about the lessons to be drawn from UK schemes.  In particular, I would caution against relying solely on the NGC incentives document, since this is only a small part of a much large jigsaw of price controls etc.

1) Do you think that the UK  for-profit Transco model has been working satisfactorily? We know it is still early for you to make a final judgement, but have the incentives and penalties shaped the way NG behaves (in terms of costs and elimination of T contraints)? 

The for-profit model has worked reasonably well so far.  Both RPI-X regulation and NGC/Transco's incentive schemes have driven out many operating costs.  However, the link into ensuring long-term investment is not clear.  RPI-X in it's purest form has poor investment incentives.  Ofgem are seeking to remedy this by introducing longer-term contracts for transmission capacity, together with upside rates of return if the companies improve on some key output measures (they are leading the way on this in gas).  Nevertheless, I think they're still some way short of solving the problem.

In my view, this is because the problem borders on the insoluble.  Ofgem are obsessed with introducing ""market based"" signals for new investment.  I'm deeply sceptical about this - while you can auction fixed amounts of capacity and thereby get a ""market price"", the capacity made available at one location depends on the amount made available at all other locations.  In short, there are major network externalities which are the source of the natural monopoly in transmission.  As a result, the regulator and/or the Transco will always need to define how much capacity should be built and made available at particular locations.  In turn, this means that while contracts can play some role, we can't leave regulation behind in ensuring that sufficient network capacity is made availalble.

As far as the for-profit and non-profit debate goes, I'm an agnostic.  The former can undoubtedly focus the mind (NGC have virtually removed voltage constraint from the system, due to installation of reactive compensation equipment), but serious doubts still remain about the ability of the UK system to implement major new investment.  On the flip side, I would be concerned about how to ensure appropriate performance incentives for non-proift transmission organisation.

2) We took a good look a the NGC system operator price control and incentive schemes under NETA - Final Proposal - Dated December 2000 (attached) . Which of the alternative proposals on page 21 has been adopted?

The final proposals are here.

http://www.ofgas.gov.uk/docs2001/ngcmod_22march.pdf 

These might be useful if you're having trouble sleeping, but I suspect that the finer details of NGC's scheme are too case-specific to be of any use elsewhere.  The key element, I think, is the fact that Ofgem gave NGC a choice from several different incentive schemes.  This mirrors some economic theory developed by Laffont and Tirole on the design of optimal incentive sctructures.  The idea is to overcome the information assymmetry between the regulator and company, because the company ""reveals"" the optimal structure in choosing between the alternatives.  

3) Have the incentives/penalties system been working or have them been subject to reviews in terms of targes, upsides, collars, and other parameters due to external factors beyond Transco control?

The incentive schemes are subject to regular review, but for the reasons above, I'm not sure you can draw any lessons beyond the general lesson that incentive schemes can be useful ways of making efficiency gains.  I'm not aware of any scheme being reopened because of external factors.

4) Could you send us (or help us find) the ""official""  Transmission Licence Agreement, where all incentives and penalties are clearly spelled out?

As above - but again, how relevant are these specifics for your purposes?

5) Question related to NETA rules:  As I understood, there is not a central pool, and market participants (generators and suppliers) have to submit a balanced schedule in the forward market. NG is responsible for [small] imbalances or residual purchasing. If that is true, how can NG be made accountable for energy deviations in the real time that it has no control whatsoever? (It seems that the incentive mechamism takes this metrics into account)

NGC accepts offers (for more generation or less demand) and bids (for less generation and more demand) which it calls off to balance the system in real time.  It doesn't need ""control"" because people are free to price these offers and bids as they see fit.  NGC can also enter balancing services contracts for particular ancillary services (reserve, reactive support etc).  NGC is subject to a balancing services incentive scheme which ensures that they balance the system economically.


6) Do you think the profit-RTO as proposed by NETA could live with a completely different congestion management system, such as central dispatch/LMP/financial rights (as current in used in the PJM pools in the US)?We have the impression that NG advocates a profit RTO and a self-dispatch, physical rights congestion system. We have been advocating the former.

I'm yet to be convinced that there are huge differences between physical/financial transmission schemes - despite noodling on the problem continuously for the last 7 years (it all started in CA in 1994 . . . . ).  At the end of the day, someone (the system operator) must decide what is required where to keep the system stable, ie, to make ""spot"" decisions on transmission availability.  If the capacity is fungible, you would also expect a secondary market to emerge in physical rights.  It would, however, be practically quite difficult to introduce an LMP scheme under NETA.  This is why we're moving down the entry-exit physical capacity route.

7) We prepared a list of questions to be sent to NG. Could you please take a look. Do they make sense? Are they based on correct assumptions regarding the UK system? Any other aspects to be investigated?

Question 3 is the main problem to resolve both within an RTO's region and between RTO's.  You might want to expand this further to include efficient investment, maintenance and operation in the light of the comments above about the deficiencies of the UK system.

Thanks.  Looks good.  Some thoughts for you to consider:
 
1.    Not sure that Impact #1 makes sense to present.  No real reason to set CTC = 0 c/kwh on Jan 5 (CalPX was still in operation).  I think that Impact #2 better captures the idea.  Also, probably not good to use the term ""CTC Eliminated"".  Maybe should say ""CTC = 0 c/kwh"".  Given the CPUC's March 27 Order, the Utilities have a claim for additional generation related stranded costs until March 31, 2002.
 
2.     In calculating Impact #2, what did you use as the Jan 19 - Aug baseline?  Did you calculate the hit of ($104.5) from actual bills or based on our DJ Index model (there is a fundamental difference in likelihood based on the baseline)?  Also, I assume that the Feb - Aug timeframe was relatively low because EES and EEMC had most of their load on bundled service.
 
3.    Probably should discuss in a footnote the different models for PX Credit calculation and most specifically the PG&E Adjustment.  Also, may be interesting to have the $ impact of the PG&E Adjustment (the rate adjustment to re-capture their previous mistake).  I think that this is something we need to go into the CPUC to fight pretty quickly.
 
4.    Should Impact #4 and Impact #5 apply to SCE's loads?  In column 4 it looks like it does.  SCE is not currently hitting our bills with this surcharge.
 
5.    Probably better to model Impact #5 as of Oct 1 not Sept 1.
 
6.    Can you break out the volumes for ""vintage"" contracts versus ""retail gen with passthru"" contracts?  You haven't shown anything for (a) Utility Undercollection costs or (b) CDWR bond fees.  These costs may hit our vintage contracts.

With EES' push into serving smaller customers, the issues in this situation -- potential affiliate abuse and unfair sharing of information -- will become more important.  When EES focused on national outsourcing, this was less an issue because our products crossed many jurisdictions.  

This issue, of course, is especially important in recently opened or opening markets as the affiliates try and secure large market share.  We are also watching for these activities in places like MI, VA, and OH.

We should discuss a couple of things before PGL starts this process:

1. How much Harper gas can PGL purchase for Nov-Mar?  I assume that all of the May-Oct '01 has already been purchased by ENA.

2.  What is the basis conversion amount to take fix price Harper and turn it into fix price Chicago?  

3. Should we encourage or discourage these producer lock-ins?  (i.e. do these deals remove a short Harper basis position that ENA doesn't want?)

IN THE NEWS...
Diabetes Increase Means More General Practitioner Involvement
Due to its alarming increase in prevalence in the last twenty years,
diabetes has gone from a ""secondary care"" or specialty issue to being a
condition in which every primary care physician must be competent to
diagnose and manage.  This article from Pulse recognizes the need for
general practice physicians to expand their diabetes resources and
become more aggressive in diagnosis and treatment.

http://ada.yellowbrix.com/pages/ada/Story.nsp?story_id=24560325&ID=ada

Lifestyle Remains Key Diabetes Risk
A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine reevaluated the
landmark 1980-1996 Nurses Health Study, in which nearly 85,000 female
nurses aged 30 to 55 were regularly monitored for dietary intake,
smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity.  Diabetes was
newly identified in 3,300 subjects in the study.  Lack of exercise, a
poor diet and current smoking were all associated with a significantly
increased risk of diabetes.

Childhood Obesity Becoming Global Problem
Childhood obesity in the United States has grown to epidemic levels, say
public health officials.  Now, a recent study led by researchers at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill finds that growing numbers
of young people in China and Russia are also overweight and obese.

Native American Conference Suggests Traditional Lifestyles
According to the U.S. Indian Health Service, there were very few, if
any, known cases of diabetes among Native Americans before 1936.
However, today Native Americans have the highest incidence of any ethnic
group for type 2 diabetes. Earlier this week in Tulsa, OK delegates from
40 Native American tribes, representatives from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, and various
health professionals attended the ""Return to Your Roots"" conference to
examine ways to combat this troubling public health program.  Much of
the conference focused on adopting traditional Native American lifestyle
habits as a means to improve their health.

Zhiyong had ask me to look into the GTV Live feed projects (see below).
I have seen the Curve manager spreadsheet.  I would like you to point me
in the right direction by:
 - telling me who are the traders who are requesting this changes.
 - can I get a copy of spreadsheets that they want the live feed on?
 - how many spreadsheets are we changing?
 - etc...

Issue 4:  Live feeds for Gas Daily/intra-month curves

? Develop live feed capability for intra-month curves just like we have for 
basis, etc.
Once this capability is complete, traders will have to set new curves.  We 
expect the curves to be set as follows:  The Henry Hub intra-month curve will 
be tied to the NYMEX feed.  Most (if not all) other curves will be tied to 
the Henry Hub intra-month curve in some way.  Traders will have to set 
differentials.

Developing the live feed capability for intra-month curves is feasible, and 
the development timeline from the IT group is 3 weeks (see project 
timeline).

Gas Pains

With the latest weather forecasts revising temperatures upward from the
Arctic blast predicted on Tuesday and hydropower in the Northwest remaining
strong, peak power prices for Friday and Saturday delivery generally fell
modestly across the WSCC.  ""There's simply no strength in the market right
now, with flows and generation as strong as they are, temperatures so high
and gas prices so low,"" explained one hair-pulling marketer.  Meanwhile,
market pundits across the region were on the edges of their seats awaiting
news from Weil, Gotshal & Manges on who cast the winning bid for Enron's
energy trading business, once considered the jewel in the ex-giant's crown.
However, the announcement had not been made as of this writing.  The law
firm was scheduled to announce the winning bid on Thursday from their New
York offices.  In gas news, NYMEX Henry Hub futures lost ground for the
second day in a row despite the AGA's bullish natural gas inventory report
released Wednesday.  The front month contract lost 4.3 cents to close at
2.185$/mmBtu, while the March contract fell 3.7 cents to close at
2.195$/mmBtu.  Both contracts were trading higher early, but came down in
late trading under a rash of short selling.  ""Everyone's trying to keep
their positions very short on this one, with all the uncertainty around,""
explained one analyst.  ""Prices could fall to as low as 2$/mmBtu before
long.""

Heavy load power at Mid-Columbia was the cheapest in the West on Thursday,
with deals ranging from 16.5 to 17.5$/MWh, a loss of 1.75$/MWh on the high
end.  ""Now that the brunt of the cold front is going to miss us, the bottom
is falling out of the market again,"" ventured one stoic player.  The
five-day forecast called for temperatures to remain above normal through
Saturday, followed by cooling to near-normal temperatures through January
14.  The latest six-to-ten called for cooling to below normal temperatures
from January 16 to 20.  Flows at Chief Joseph remained healthy, and were
even revised slightly upward for the coming week on forecasts of rain and
snow showers, with Friday coming in at 65 kcfs, Saturday at 60 kcfs, Sunday
at 50 kcfs, Monday coming up to 95 kcfs, and 90 kcfs through next Thursday.
There were no new unit outages to report on with certainty on Thursday, but
there were murmurings in the Northwest that Colstrip #3 (686 MW) had joined
its sister unit #4 (700 MW) off-line. No confirmation was available.

As weather forecasts continued to call for near-normal temperatures through
Monday and spot gas prices at the Socal border stayed steady, power prices
for the Friday/Saturday package softened in the Golden State on Thursday.
Peak power at SP15 traded between 18 and 20.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals
done in the 19s, while the off-peak product changed hands from 14 to 15.25.
In political news, California's Attorney General filed a civil suit against
PG&E Corp on Thursday, seeking $600 million to $4 billion in damages.  The
state alleged PG&E Corp. received substantial, unwarranted cash flows over
the past 4 years from its subsidiary PG&E, and finally did nothing to
prevent the utility from falling into bankruptcy last year.  For their part,
PG&E Corp said CPUC auditors had thoroughly reviewed their transactions with
their subsidiary and found nothing fraudulent.  On the generation front,
Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) was almost at full power on Thursday, operating at
690 MW.  Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) exited the grid for planned maintenance.
Friday forecasts called for high temperatures to the reach the mid-50s in
Sacramento, the low-60s in the Bay area, and the low-70s at southern load
centers.  Little change was seen in the forecast through Monday of the new
week.  The most current six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from
January 16 to 20.

The Southwest, locked in the grips of a heat wave pushing temperatures into
the 70s in Phoenix, posted moderate decreases in peak power prices for the
Friday-Saturday package.  Goods at Palo Verde changed hands from 17 to
19.75$/MWh, a loss of 1.75$/MWh on the high end.  Many marketers reported
very light trading at other hubs in the region, such as Four Corners and
Mona.  The five-day forecast put temperatures in above-normal territory
through January 14 in the desert region, with some cooling outside of the
desert on Monday.  The latest six-to-ten predicted continuing near- to
slightly below-normal temperatures from January 16 through 20.  In unit
news, coal juggernaut Four Corners #5 (750 MW), which was scheduled for a
maintenance outage on January 15, tripped off-line late Wednesday with a
condenser tube leak.  Plant operators decided that no attempt would be made
to repair the leak and place the unit back on-line before the scheduled
maintenance, so the ETR will be near March 14, 2002.  Fellow coal-smoker
Coronado #1 (365 MW) missed its January 9 ETR yesterday.  The new estimated
date of return is sometime in the evening on January 11.

We will be rolling out a new version of Deal Entry & Deal Blotter this 
afternoon to support California scheduling & volume management.  For most of 
the users, there will be no impact except for a few new fields that can be 
ignored in Enpower's Deal Entry.  Below is a list of the changes:


Deal Entry (These fields should only be populated for California deals)
1.  Added Settlement Entity - Identifies where the power is scheduled and 
settled.

2.  Added Sched Coordinator - Identifies the coordinator responsible for 
scheduling the power.

3.  Schedule Type - Defines the type of schedule used in California.

4.  Market Reference - Defines the market when the power will flow.

Deal Blotter

deals under them.  Unfortunately, Enpower contains the CPs for Canada and the 
Emissions group, which are sometimes similar names.  Sometimes Europe 
attaches CPs by mistake and we have takenf them out also.  Name changes and 
mergers also complicate things.  What we do is keep an eye out for the 
incorrect CP and try to inform the traders when they are picking the wrong 
CP.   Believe me, if the developers could differentiate the CPs in Global CP, 
it would be done.  I guess the issue is how much time and money it would 
require to change CP to feed just our CPs.  And on APS, they have informed us 
that they are still trading under both names until 1/1/01 and credit is okay 
with this.  I could go on and on about all the issues, but you get the idea.

another Scandinavian capital or revisiting the bars in London.  Berlin,

I am sending you by FedEx tonight a copy of the most recent edition of the 
cruising guide to the Virgin Islands.  It's not required reading but I 
thought you might find it interesting to see a bit about where we will be 
sailing.  Please be sure to bring it along with you since we will need it if 
we try and go to any spots we haven't been to before and since it will have 
the most up to date information on navigation, restaurants, bars, etc. (you 
will see little hand-drawn charts of the most popular anchorages - these are 
surprisingly useful).

There's a lot of information in there.  If you want to focus on just a few, 
the places we are (in my humble and easily overridden opinion) most likely to 
visit are:

Road Town - that's where we will pick up the boat so we're pretty certain to 
be there
The Bight on Norman Island - deserted island but a floating bar/restaurant, 
good snorkeling nearby
Jost Van Dyke - we have always liked Sydney's Peace & Love in Little Harbor 
and Foxy's in Great Harbor
Sandy Cay - the classic deserted island, very small - probably just a lunch 
or quick swim stop
Cane Garden Bay - a little tricky  getting in but well worth it - the 
quintessential Caribbean beach (swath of white sand, palm trees, steel bands, 
etc.)
Trellis Bay - closest anchorage to the airport and where there used to be a 
restaurant called The Last Resort
Cooper Island - nice quiet resort on the island with a good outdoor dining 
option
The Baths - wouldn't be a trip to the BVI without a stop here
Bitter End Yacht Club - probably about as far as we'd want to go

There are some great beaches and secluded anchorages over on St. John but it 
is in the US Virgins which means clearing the boat out of immigration and 
customs in the BVI, then clearing into the US at Cruz Bay on St. John and 
then back into the BVI when we go back over there.  Kind of a lot of trouble, 
particularly since the anchorage in Cruz Bay is so crowded it's impossible to 
find a good place to leave the boat while we go to clear in.  We've done it 
before but my view is that with limited time it just isn't worth it.  Of 
course, we started this with the assumption that my view isn't necessarily 
controlling here and I know that Linda particularly likes the restaurant at 
Caneel Bay (fancy resort) on St. John.  So stay tuned.

We will need to be sure we are anchored somewhere near Tortola (which 
probably just means not at the Bitter End or on St. John) the night before 
your flight so we can make sure you get to the airport.  One alternative is 
to stay at Trellis Bay - or right across at Marina Cay - that night and just 
dinghy you over to the dock - it's a 5 min. walk to the airport.  Or we can 
drop you anywhere else there's a phone since there are taxis that can be 
called and the island just isn't that big - I don't think it could take more 
than an hour by car to get from any one spot on the island to any other!

I put the Moorings luggage tags in with the cruising guide.  They aren't that 
important unless you check bags.  Please be sure to use them if you check 
anything since that will make it much more likely that they will catch up 
with us some day.  I'm not sure, but it may also make it just a tad easier to 
get through BVI customs when they see those familiar tags.

Here are some BVI links if you have time to do a little surfing:

2.  I am not sure why all collateral except LCs was deleted.  Was this
agreed by EFR?  If so, OK.  If not, could the CSA provide for other
collateral as Gordon requested.  It is unusual for SR entities to use LCs
in non-reinsurance situations and would probably cost them less to post
Treasuries.  Here it is of course unlikely that EFR will have to post
anything, since EFR will always be in the money to some extent.

On 9/27 Traci Warner called me and said that Enron feared that they were ""getting too deep into core schools"" and that they wanted to do direct recruiting at LSU (solicit resumes, screen, and do phone interviews).  They had decided that they wanted to make a presentation to finance students in BR and would probably send Mike and Linsday to meet my class, then have Mike, Lindsday, and another speaker at an SFA meeting.  This meeting would be followed by a receptionist at a local restaurant.


Traci said that she'd call me back on Friday, 9/28, and asked me to suggest a place for the reception.  She did not call me, but Corina Taylor left a message at 5:30 p.m.  


I called Corina on Monday 10/1.  She said that she was assigned to get a speaker to SFA and that she was not certain about a reception.  She said that Enron reps would accept resumes at the meeting.  She called me again today and said that they could have a speaker at LSU for Thursday, October 18.  She asked me to send her a building and room number.


I'm going to get back to her and ask for clarification on whether they want to plan for a small reception.

Further to my earlier voice-mail, I attach a copy of a Restricted List 
procedure we put together with the assistance of Slaughter and May.  The 
procedure has not yet been rolled out (since the then OTC product had not 
developed to a stage requiring implementation), but was intended to be sent 
to all business heads in Europe (ie desk heads, and staff at VP level and 
above, not just in trading). 

I hope you are able to assist us in putting together the procedures 
(including a form of consent letter) based on our discussion on Thursday and 
would be grateful if you could confirm.  

Many thanks and best regards

Just a heads up to let you know that there is a new product type awaiting 
your approval (currently ""Partially Approved"") in EnronOnline Datamanager. It 
is an Australian power financial spread product (#2001) and will be an 
inter-regional spread using the existing financial power swap products i.e. 
VIC, SA, NSW & QLD peak & flat products as the underlying contracts.

Our senior legal counsel in the Sydney office, David Minns, has indicated 
that the existing GTC for Australian power products (see attached) can also 
be used for this new product type.

I would appreciate it if you could review this as soon as possible. Please 
let me know if you require anything further.

Note, a sigma factor (4.07) has been assigned by RAC which will be amended 
after the product type has been approved.

to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership,

2949,"Hi Mark,

I was hoping that you might have some time to have a discussion on the 
feasibility of layering an order routing system onto Enron Online.

More specifically, Enron Trading Services Inc. (the FCM) would like to do an 
assessment re: whether there are any material regulatory or other 
consequences resulting from linking a possible ETS trading website to Enron 
Online.  The idea would be that many of Enron's existing customers that are 
not also customers of ETS but who require brokerage services in futures and 
options on futures may be interested in obtaining ETS services.  
Conceptually, this business would be run and administered through ETS and 
what would be involved is a link from the EOL website directing customers who 
choose to use ETS to the ETS website.

To that end, we have done some very preliminary work, and believe that the 
main issue is structuring such a relationship between ETS and EOL such that 
EOL will not be considered an Introducing Broker.  Of course, however, we 
cannot form any meaningful opinion without a broader internal discussion with 
you and any other person that is familiar with our regulatory position on 
matters relating to this.

Please let me know when you would be available to have a preliminary 
discussion.

Thanks a lot,

I concur with your summary of the tax issue below and, if the facts are as 
you posit, we would need to implement a cost sharing arrangement to address 
the tax exposure raised by having a person located in London who acts on 
behalf of ENA and, even at that, there may be additional concerns that would 
have to be addressed.  Separately, I have spoken with Jeff Blumenthal 
regarding the Singapore domain name issue and, in general, believe that we 
should be able to have ECTS acquire the domain name (which, from my 
discussion with Jeff, I understand is required due to Singapore rules 
requiring such names only be held by Singaporeans) and cross-charge ENA for 
the expense associated with it.  In this fashion, we place the costs of EOL's 
forage into Singapore with ENA who, in turn, allocates such charge to the 
participants of EOL via the EOL Cost Sharing Agreement.  Finally, Jeff has 
contacted Janine Juggins in London regarding an assessment of the tax 
presence issues raised by ECTS's acquisition, and  EOL's use, of a domain 
name in Singapore but my initial reaction is that such activity should not 
present any significant Singapore tax nexus issues - we will follow up with 
you on this after Janine is able to solidify our advice on the matter.  I 
hope all is well with you in Brazil and look forward to speaking with you 
soon.  Best regards.

I have whittled down the attachments to just reiterate my original comments 
on the ordering that would currently be generated by the system (which would 
concatenate descriptive text elements according to the underlying attributes 
of a product selected). 

I feel certain we will be able to accomodate any specific ordering

writing rules specific to your product types - if the current rules will 
suffice, however, that will save some effort.

I have reviewed the language sent by Paul. 

The description is broken down into 8 paragraphs - for the record:

Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 7 all cover details usually covered in the Product Type 
description (7 is actually settlement date[s] for which we do not have a 
separate attribute). 

Paragraph 4 is reference period.
Paragraph 5 is Index.
Paragraph 6 is loadshape.

These look fine to me - subject to my observations on whether we can use the 
'Averaging' language. 

Paragraph 8 covers 2 attributes - currency (looks fine) and Unit of Measure -

i.e. If we are stupid and hurt ourselves, then shame on us, but if we simply 
do not take some action and thereby fail to prevent the Counterparty from 
inflicting damage on us, then that is something different.

Thoughts?

Jennifer (PCG) has supplied me with example language from the confirmations 
which is representative of the the other confirmations. I agreed that you and

I think the best way to proceed on this is if we work up example wording for 
most of the different publication types, and/or verify any wording suggested 
by Jennifer against the original confirm language.

I will bring up the originals to you, but my suggestion for a rework is:


Daily price midpoint example (For Gas Daily, Oklahoma-PEPL):

The Index shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on each calendar day 
during the term of the transaction under the heading ""Daily Price Survey"" in 
the Oklahoma - PEPL section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a 
business day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published 
on the next succeeding business day.


Monthly price example (For NGI, Northern California Border):

The Index shall be the ""Bidweek Average"" price for the Northern Cal Border 
Average as listed in the table entitled ""California Border & Non-Utility 
End-User Citygate tables"", published in the first issue in each month of 
Natural Gas Intelligence Weekly Gas Price Index for the term of the 
transaction.


Monthly price example (For Inside Ferc, Texas,Oklahoma PEPL)

The Index shall be the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co - Texas, Oklahoma 
(mainline) price as listed in the section entitled ""Prices of Spot Gas 
Delivered to Pipelines"", published in the first issue in each month of Inside 
Ferc's Gas Market Report for the term of the transaction.

2992,"Western Power Market Stands 'Poised on the 
Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting
Group's 1999 Bulk Power Outlook

FAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Power markets in the Western System 
Coordinating Council are ``poised on the
precipice'' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer 
and next, according to a new study of the regional
market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``The West 
stands at least a one in three chance of
experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during 
the summer of 1998,'' said Judah Rose, a Senior
Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.

ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications: 

     Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand 
balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying
     on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak 
capacity requirements. Because demand growth is
     outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more 
extreme over the next two years.
     Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive 
year of above-average hydroelectric generation
     -- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus -- will again 
mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in
     1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 1990s resurface, 
the West will find itself at an even greater risk of
     price spikes.
     Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and 
2000, the result of both higher regional spot
     natural gas prices and the increasing value of ``pure capacity'' -- the 
value of ensuring reliability for consumers. 

The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and 
highlights the following key results: 

     Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand 
growth is strong, creating a long-term regional
     capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 2005, unless there is a 
serious economic downturn in the region.
     Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices 
is for negative real growth through 2010, but
     the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market 
institutions continue to evolve and new supply is
     slowly added over the next few years.
     Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue 
to rise (but still remain below many other
     regions) as new, more efficient generation is added.
     Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power 
generation is poised to more than double by 2010,
     with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest 
subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas
     supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if 
any, real price appreciation through 2010. 

``The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the 
other five regional volumes, offers
comprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power 
markets,'' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of the
ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``No other firm can match our analytic 
capabilities -- which are based on an understanding of the
fundamentals driving electric power markets -- and the knowledge gained from 
working one- on-one with the market's key
players.''

3016,"Digital Frontiers 
 Calif. Says Digitally Signed Broker Contracts Are Valid
 By ROSS SNEL
   
 08/03/1999 
 American Banker 
 Page 12 
 Copyright (c) 1999 American Banker, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

 A new California law opens the door for brokerages to conduct most, if not 
all, of their business in
 cyberspace.

 The legislation, which applies only to broker-dealers, validates brokerage 
contracts that are digitally
 signed.

 Though Internet brokerages routinely accept trading orders on-line, most 
require customers to enroll
 and order account transfers by sending in paper documents. The law makes 
such paperwork no
 longer necessary.

 Digital signatures-a derivative of data encryption technology that binds 
customer identities to
 documents-are seen as a way to ""legalize"" on-line exchanges of information.

 The California legislation, which California Governor Gray Davis signed into 
law last week, ""gives
 people some certainty that these contracts are enforceable,"" said Thomas J. 
Smedinghoff, a partner in
 the Chicago law firm McBride Baker & Coles and a leading authority on 
digital signatures.

 He added, however, that the law's specific definition of a digital signature 
could limit the flexibility of
 its application as the technology evolves.

 Certainty about the validity of digital credentials is especially important 
to securities brokers, because
 securities transactions are typically much bigger than merchandise 
transactions on the Internet, said
 Christopher Musto, a senior analyst at Gomez Advisors Inc. in Concord, Mass.

 E-Trade Group Inc., the Menlo Park, Calif. on-line broker, pushed for the 
California bill, bringing the
 issue to the attention of state Sen. John Vasconcellos, a Democrat from San 
Jose. Sen. Vasconcellos
 introduced the proposal in February, and it passed the Senate July 15.

 San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp., the leading Internet brokerage, 
also offered input on
 the law's definition of a digital signature, according to Sen. Vasconcellos' 
chief of staff, Rand Martin.

 Schwab has focused its legislative efforts more on the federal level, 
however, a spokesman for the
 company said. ""This action is a step in the right direction,"" the spokesman 
said. ""But the real objective
 would be to get national legislation that creates uniformity regarding the 
use of digital signatures.""

 E-Trade said in a news release that the new law would apply to its 
transactions with customers in all
 50 states, but the Schwab spokesman said its applicability beyond California 
is ""murky.""

 E-Trade did not respond to calls seeking elaboration on how it sees the law 
applying across the
 country.

 Mr. Smedinghoff, chairman of the American Bar Association's electronic 
commerce division, said the
 only way the law would have broader applicability is if a broker stipulated 
that a contract was
 governed by the laws of California.

 Legislation on digital signatures varies from state to state. For example, 
Connecticut law covers only
 medical records at hospitals, while Illinois makes electronic signatures 
applicable to all
 communications.

 In 1995 California became one of the early adopters of digital signature 
legislation, but that legislation
 was limited to communication with government agencies.

 Utah is often cited as the country's digital signature pacesetter, with a 
comprehensive law that
 preceded California's in 1995 and resulted in the pioneering designation of 
Digital Signature Trust
 Co., a Zions Bancorp. subsidiary, as a licensed certificate authority.

 To bring consistency at the federal level, Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) 
this year introduced two
 bills addressing the issue. The Millennium Digital Commerce Act sets out to 
clarify the legal status of
 electronic signatures in general, while the Electronic Securities 
Transaction Act focuses on the
 securities industry.

and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and lands in a
water trap. Moses walks down, parts the water and chips the ball onto
the green.

Jesus steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over
the fairway and lands in the water trap. Jesus just walks on the
water and chips the ball onto the green.

The old man steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing
over the fairway and heads for the water trap. But just before it 
falls into the water, a fish jumps up and grabs the ball in its mouth.
As the fish is falling back down into the water, an eagle swoops down 
and grabs the fish in its claws.  The eagle flies over the green, where 
a lightning bolt shoots from the sky and barely misses it. Startled, 
the eagle drops the fish.  When the fish hits the ground, the ball 
pops out of its mouth and rolls into the hole for a hole-in-one.

around, we won't bring you next time.""",Moses Jesus Dad,,

How much protection do the agreements give us?  I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers.  Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.  I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing.  I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.  It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.

are out there for all terms.  Cary Metz is managing the Perm products.

I will handle the prompt month physical fixed price and index for all of the

The rest of the group will continue to manage their cash index points for the 
next day trading, while adding the BOM physical with a basis link to 
Monique's GD BOM products.  I would like to get the cash products out on eol 
by 7:15 each morning.  The early info will come in handy as we approach 
winter.  Let me know what you think.   Steve and Matt have started a pilot 
program in the NW for rolling out their next day cash products after 11:00 am 
each day.  We will look into rolling out the SW in the future.

We are in the process of sending out the ""odd lot"" notice to our customers 
regarding all products on eol.  We will change our product minimum to one 
mmbtu in the next week.  You may want to discuss this with your direct 
customers before the mailout.

secret that we have a new commitment to physical in the west.  If you review 
your customer contact sheet and discover an old customer that we haven't 
contacted in some time, then call them and visit.  We will be using EOL and

1.  SWG says price on Sitara 518455 Day 7 should be $9.50 instead of $9.55 -

forwarded your email to my contact at SWG and she responded with the email 
below.  Could you please call SWG trader Mark Anderson so that this can be

2.  On Sitara 386140 SWG says trigger is calculated on physical, not 
scheduled, volume - You have already confirmed with me that the trigger is 
based on scheduled volume and that you feel SWG will not agree.  According to

3049,"I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip 
to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their 
website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not 
saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, 
but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's 
filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's 
obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, 
with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we 
definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?
